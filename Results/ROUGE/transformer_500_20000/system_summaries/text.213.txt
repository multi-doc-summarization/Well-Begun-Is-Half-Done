" it was a good value because you get two days for the price of one . i fully recommend this side trip to yellowstone . take your camera ! great for all age groups . " park officials say they did n't believe the sow was the same one that killed brian matayoshi on july 7 . the bear , which is believed to have killed the hiker and wolf discovery center in west yellowstone 's hayden valley , were captured and relocated from the grizzly 's body .
