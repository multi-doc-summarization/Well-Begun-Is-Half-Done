nestle has failed to convince european judges that it 's the right to trademark the shape of its kitkat bar , the guardian reports . the european court of justice ruled wednesday that the kitkat bar sold in 40 million pounds ( $ 61.7 million for a year ) was introduced to the uk 's high court for a final decision . according to the guardian , the four fingers have become " completely associated with kitkats , " and the eu has not sought to trademark it . nestle , which owns mishcon de reya , says it plans to appeal the ruling . the ruling comes after a literary club met at a pie shop owned by christoppher kat club and took its name from an abbreviated version of the owner 's name . it 's not clear whether nestle 's trademark did not comply with european law , but a european court lawyer tells the guardian it 's " ridiculous " and " ridiculous . " nestle , who owns the bar in london in 1935 , argues that the company is n't the only one who can recognize the product exclusively by that characteristic . nestle argues that nestle 's application is a " <unk> bar " for the company 's " <unk> bar , " as it stands for a trademark in the name of the kitkat .
