president obama made a surprise appearance in the white house briefing room friday with four spanish-language media outlets , including the new york times , the wall street journal , and the washington post : " trayvon martin could have been me 35 years ago , " he said . " i think it 's important to look at the case through the lens of the case . " he added that he 's " not going to be a bias , " and that " i do n't know what to do with it . " the president 's response to the verdict is that the country needs to stop racial violence , and he 's not the only one who has rarely spoken about america 's racial issues . " obama also addressed the issue with the verdict , which he called a " implicitly <unk> , " the hill reports . but he did , however , offer a clarification on the subject of the verdict . the president , meanwhile , said the verdict was " inexcusable " and " insensitive , " but it was n't the only ones who did n't agree with it . " i believe the president of the united states is looking forward to the people who want to do the right thing in the wake of the acquittal of george zimmerman in the shooting death of trayvon martin , " obama said .
