" he continued , and he did n't seem to agree with it . " there 's a great message for people struggling to get by and trying to make ends meet . do n't complain about corporations are too ! " he also called the comment " brutal. " and said it was his last line . " i think it 's unfair to think that it 's going to run on ?
