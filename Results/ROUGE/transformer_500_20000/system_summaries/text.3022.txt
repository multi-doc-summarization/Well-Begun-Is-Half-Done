the greenland ice sheet has been explored by scientists from the university of vermont who say they 've found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet for 2.7 million years , reports the guardian . the researchers say that greenland really was green at one point when it was discovered in 2013 , when the <unk> tundra covered greenland 's highest point in the ice . " there was a really stable landscape on greenland before the sheet came , " says research author paul bierman . " this landscape has been preserved from beyond the dawn of humankind . " the team says it 's unlikely the ice will be buried in the sky for 200,000 years to 1 million years before ice covered it . " now we know that it 's a refrigerator that 's preserved this antique , " bierman tells the guardian , which notes that the soil is a lot older than previously thought , but it 's not clear whether it will be refilled with climate change . " the new results suggest that even during the warmest periods of history , the soil under the ice is still in response to changes in temperature ? "
