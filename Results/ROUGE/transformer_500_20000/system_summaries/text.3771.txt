" we 've never seen anything like this before . " the study , published in the plos record , found dickinsonia , was the first complex multi-cellular organisms to appear on earth in the northwest of russia , according to the bbc . the researchers , who used the technique to take a fresh look at the creature 's origins , say dickinsonia , who has a 5-month-old daughter , is a member of the group of life forms known as dickinsonia fungi , protozoans , and <unk> . the researchers say dickinsonia is a " <unk> explosion , " and the " <unk> explosion " in a remote area near the white sea .
