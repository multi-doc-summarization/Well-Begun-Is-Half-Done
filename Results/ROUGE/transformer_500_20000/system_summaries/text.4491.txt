a massive oil pipeline from alberta to british columbia has cut off from the rest of civilization , the guardian reports . " they want to bring big oil to this coast , " says landscape photographer jack dykinga . " the only thing that 's standing between that is really the spirit bear , the efforts from conservationists and the first nation [ native ] people , " mcallister tells the guardian . the plan is to create a snapshot of this area , but the great bear faces a " swat team of photographers that are deployed to an area that needs immediate media attention . " mcallister , who runs the international league of conservation photographers , says the goal is to transform the bear 's home into a superhighway for supertankers . " it is a magnificent bear , " he says . " it 's one of the richest people in the world . " he adds that the pipeline is still " bursting at the open door of a helicopter . " he notes that while it 's not clear how many people are going to be able to get it , " there 's large sea stars , colonies of steller sea lions , orcas , and eagles . "
