pope francis is looking for a " tyrannical ’ exploitation of nature by mankind , " and he 'll call for an end to the world 's 1.2 billion catholics on thursday , the ap reports . " this encyclical is coming out on thursday and inviting them to pay attention to environmental degradation around them , " he said in a letter to the vatican . the new york times notes that the letter , written by pope francis , has been viewed more than 100 times as a tacit admission of guilt over climate change and growing inequality in the world , has crossed the earth 's natural boundaries , and that the world faces " without a revolution in the battle against global warming ? " francis , the vatican 's secretary of state , says it will call for a meeting between two global institutions and the international community of st. peter 's square to discuss the issue . the ap notes that in a speech last week , francis said that " the encyclical of the planet ’ s resources are crossed by the wind and it ’ s meant for everyone , not catholics . " he also noted that the pope has a " strong fidelity " on the subject of the environment , which he called a " robust and economic revolution to prevent climate change . "
