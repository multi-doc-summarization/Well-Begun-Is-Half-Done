robert j. samuelson of the new york times thinks bernanke is too timid in fighting high unemployment and slow economic growth . " it ’ s being called the battle of the beards , " he writes in a column at economics . " or to put it another way , i don ’ t think everyone who disagrees with me is stupid and/or evil . just the ones who actually are stupid and/or <unk> . " the fed has kept interest rates just above zero , but it 's not clear whether the fed will be able to keep inflation around 2 % annually , notes the wall street journal . the fed is n't the only one to blame for the fed 's emergency loans crisis , but krugman is n't convinced . " i wish more economic discussion was like this , as opposed to the fraudulence that permeates most of the “ debate ’ s going on ? beyond the rhetoric , there ’ s a serious debate about the federal reserve , " writes krugman in the editorial . it 's " a bit more inflation . this would spur growth and job creation .
