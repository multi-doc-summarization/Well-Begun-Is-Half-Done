the discovery of a coptic papyrus fragment that surfaced in 2012 has prompted a flurry of speculation that jesus and mary magdalene were married , reports the new york times . the papyrus may have been a copy of a gospel written in the second century in greek , but it 's not clear whether it 's a forgery . the revelation comes after a live science investigation found that laukamp corporation for milling and boreworks in venice , florida , in 1963 , in turn , was co-owner of acmb-american 's estate in sarasota county . the revelation came days after king dated the papyrus to the fourth and ninth centuries later . the anonymous owner of the papyrus in question says he did n't have an interest in the papyrus but did n't collect it . " jesus said to them , 'my wife , ' " he says . " i 'm not going to be here . ' " the revelation is n't the first time the papyrus has been announced , but the harvard theological review says it 's " silent " and it will be preserved in a " mary , possibly mary magdalene . " the papyrus itself is believed to have belonged to the ancient egyptian government , which has a cache of op-eds in the wall street journal and cnn . king says he has n't disclosed the papyrus until now , but he says he 's " not interested in diverting it to the rightful place .
