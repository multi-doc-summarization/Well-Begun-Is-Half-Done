a new study finds that boys who delay starting a family are more likely to have " geekier " sons , reports the bbc . the study , published in the journal of delayed parenthood , found boys who scored higher on the geek index at 12 years old , were found to be more intelligent , more focused on their interests than those born to younger fathers . the researchers then combined these scores into an overall <unk> iq of about 8,000 british twins , and found that the older father had no impact , and daughters seemed to be immune . " although these traits are continuously associated with future socioeconomic status , " lead researcher andrew <unk> says in a press release . " we hypothesised that high iq , strong focus on the subject of interest and little concern about ‘ fitting in ’ will be associated with such success , " he says , per the bbc . the study suggests that having an older father may benefit children and boost their performance in technical subjects at secondary school , but it 's not clear how focused and why they were . the study also points to a link between apa and psychological research and the us and britain , which has been criticized for not having children later in life . the researchers say that while it is n't clear whether it 's a good idea , it may be a good omen for some congressmen .
