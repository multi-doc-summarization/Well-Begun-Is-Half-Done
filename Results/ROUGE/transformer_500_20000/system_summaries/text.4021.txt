elvis is n't the only one in the company 's best-selling products . the scottish brewers launched their grapefruit and blood orange juice ipa in 2015 , and they 've been named after the king , who died in 1977 , reports the telegraph . the beer was endorsed by elvis presley enterprises , which sold brewdog for millions of dollars through a licensing that grants the right to manufacture and sell merchandise worldwide . but the brewers are n't buying it . " we would like to recommend that presley 's estate diverts its attention to another potential source of quick remuneration : a brewery that calls itself 'the king ' of beer , " says dickie . " weirdly enough , that tactic did n't work . " brewdog has changed their names to elvis to show that presley was n't a only out there , notes the telegraph . it 's not clear how the beer got its name , but it 's a good bet that brewdog is now selling it for $ 1 million . it 's also a gutsy move to prove the name is not exclusive , but the makers of elvis ' estate say they were duped by hoaxes .
