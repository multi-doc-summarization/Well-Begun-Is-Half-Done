president obama 's speech at the democratic national convention last night was a " mountain out of a molehill , " writes chris cillizza at the washington post . " there 's only one president who actually came from hope , " he writes . " but that ’ s a minor fear if you ’ re obama . " in fact , it 's not clear whether he 'll be able to offer a rousing endorsement of the gop national convention in charlotte , nc , and elsewhere on the campaign trail . " this is not an attempt to connect the dots between the president and the democrats and the republicans , " observes ezra klein at the atlantic . it 's also " the most expensive senate race in history , " and it 's " not unexpected " that the gop will have to do with the gop 's " hope and change " message , writes klein . " it ’ s time to get a great speech tomorrow . " the gop establishment " will be showcased tonight when the former president takes the stage to place the president 's name in nomination at the convention . " it 's an incredible honor , " says klein , who notes that obama 's campaign manager has n't been vetted by the campaign . " i do n't think it 's going to be a big deal , " she says . " we have had lots of conversations with president clinton , " adds klein . " the fact that the clinton show is n't a close race . "
