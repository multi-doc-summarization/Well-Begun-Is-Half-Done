fitch has revised the outlook for the u.s.a. 's aaa credit rating to negative from stable , reports marketwatch . the move comes after fitch placed the credit rating of the us on thursday without a deal to increase its ability to borrow . " the prolonged negotiations over raising the debt ceiling ( following the episode in 2011 ) risks undermining the role of the u.s.dollar as the global reserve currency , by casting doubt over the full faith and credit of the u.s. , " said fitch . " this 'faith ' is a key reason why the us 'aaa ' rating can tolerate a substantially higher level of public debt than other 'aaa ' . " the wall street journal points out that fitch expects to resolve the rwn by the end of q114 at the latest level . the journal chalks it up to a technicality in the case of fitch , whose name is not the only one in the nation 's most popular currency rating . the journal sees it as " the latest salvo in q114 's attempt to raise the ceiling and end the government shutdown , " and notes that it 's not clear how to make it happen .
