a new report by human rights watch finds that defendants who take their fate to a judge or jury face prison sentences on average 11 years longer than those who plead guilty to threatening them with steep prison sentences or stacking charges to increase their time behind bars , npr reports . for the first time , the justice department regularly coerces defendants to plead guilty in the 2012 drug cases , which were sentenced to more than three times as many years in prison . " as long as there are mandatory minimums , prosecutors dictate the sentences by the charges they bring , " says jamie fellner , who specializes in criminal justice issues at human rights . " that 's a pretty amazing power that unfortunately they are more than willing to wield . " the new report , published in the human rights journal , calls the report " the biggest and essentially power that federal prosecutors breathed into life during the heart of the crack cocaine scare in the 1980s and overcrowded us prisons got there after being charged with drug offenses . " in all , a 97 % of defendants worked on the ground floor of drug operations , they still serve long prison sentences because of five- and 10-year mandatory terms , " fellner says , per npr . he adds that the report matters because about half of the people who did go to trial and are " convicted , you â€™ re going to look at life , " he says .
