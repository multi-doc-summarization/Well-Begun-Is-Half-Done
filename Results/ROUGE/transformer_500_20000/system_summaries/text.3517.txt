scientists have found a correlation between the antarctic region 's <unk> proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing as low as 29 degrees fahrenheit , the washington post reports . the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that the proteins ' anti-melting properties in the southern ocean are caused by climate change . " we discovered what appears to be the first time we 've been able to achieve this , " researcher rolf <unk> says in a press release . " it ’ s very clear that we ’ re going to have to deal with it . " the study , published in plos one , found that fish species must be sustaining the strength of the ice in their veins . the study also found that in the frigid waters of antarctica , the antifreeze has shrunk significantly more than 90 % since the end of the year . the study found that 227 % of species die from climate change in the atmosphere than the other species of birds and birds . researchers say that while the study is n't conclusive , it " has been revealing facts about the notothenioid for more than a decade and has persisted for the last few years . " in the study of <unk> species , the researchers found that <unk> and <unk> species are more likely to be accelerated by melting glaciers and weakening their growth rate in the warmer waters . the study found <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
