evolution and genetics seem to have baked a certain amount of murder into humans as a species , but civilization has tamed some of the savage beast in us , according to a new study . scientists calculated the rate at which more than 1,000 species kill their own kind , and noticed how closely related species have similar rates of lethal violence . they essentially found that where a species is on evolutionary tree of life tells a lot about how violent the species is to its own kind . " we 're in a rough neighborhood , " the study 's lead author tells the ap . " at least to some extent , the way humans organise in societies influences our levels , " he says . " lethal violence is part of our evolutionary history but not carved in stone in â€˜ our genes , ' " he adds , adding that " in the broadest terms , is that humans have evolved strategies for solving problems with violence , " and it 's not clear whether genetics or other factors are responsible . the study also found lethal violence in primates between the ages of 18 and 17 , and that it 's part of a larger mammalian family that lives in the blanco state of mexico . the researchers say they 've found a tendency to bump off members of the same church as the <unk> of the <unk> tribe , which has been linked to the <unk> extinction of the species . ( in another study , researchers found that the study was n't conclusive . )
