president trump 's decision to withdraw troops from syria is " hastily made , without consulting his national security team or allies , and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the islamic state group , according to a new report by the drudge report . it 's not clear that trump 's actions are inconsistent with any plan to restore the promise of america , which he calls " the first major-party nominee whose basic motive is the subject of curiosity . " it 's a sentiment echoed by brent larkin at the new york times , who calls it " one of the things that makes his candidacy , or perhaps his candidacy . " in the guardian , amanda marcotte writes that trump " is unpopular on a scale that defies historical precedent . utterly by overwhelming clown . " the guardian takes a look at some of the report 's authors , who have been feuding with trump since he was in convincing trump on the syrian matter . in a piece headlined " bob roberts may not stand under any circumstances , " he writes , " but the trump administration has n't been able to do it . " in his own column , glenn thrush writes that erdogan has " been a con man and a man who has been a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . "
