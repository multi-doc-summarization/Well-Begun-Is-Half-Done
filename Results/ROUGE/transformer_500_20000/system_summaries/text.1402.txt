florida 's busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights , including us citizens , according to officials who say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans , nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding , the ap reports . florida 's airport is the busiest airport in the us , and florida has about 6 million international passengers in the past year . " we 're not going to be able to opt out , " says an associate of privacy & technology at the georgetown university law center . " we are going to make a lot of money . we do n't have to pay for it . we 're going to have to do it . " the airport , which is the first to be tested , is expected to be the first us airport to require an expansion of the airport . the agency says it has n't been aware of the database , but it 's not clear whether it will be rescheduled to friday or tuesday . the ap notes it 's unclear whether the agency will have a face or eye contact with passengers or crew members .
