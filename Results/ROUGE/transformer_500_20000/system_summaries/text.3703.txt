a pair of capybaras escaped from their pen at the high park in toronto on may 24 , but they did n't find any trace of it . the toronto star reports the capybaras was seen swimming at the south end of high park on june 5 when he spotted the capybara right at his feet . " she was right there ! and she was ninja-still . it looked like a log , " says bert d for tracking him down . the city says the traps could be seen at high park , but the city 's residents are n't sure where they 'll find it . " we 're not going to have to go to a new enclosure , " dandy says . " we are going to find a place where we 're going to get to the zoo . " the zoo has been nicknamed bonnie and clyde by the public , but it 's not clear how many of the missing capybaras are still missing , the guardian reports . it 's been more than three weeks since it was spotted in a park near the queensway , which has a long history of cheekily posting sightings of the alligator and packing on a break for it while being hunted down by a shark or shark in the vicinity of the zoo . " we have a lot of people who do n't know if it 's going to happen , " one tourist says . " i think it 's a good idea . "
