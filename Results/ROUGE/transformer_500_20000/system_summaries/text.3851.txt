cia director john brennan took an extraordinary step thursday to contain the " enhanced interrogation techniques " of the cia , the washington post reports . " what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques , " brennan said in a statement . " it is our view that the cia engaged in brutal interrogation techniques and misled the white house and the public about what it was doing , " he said . " we were not authorized , were abhorrent and rightly should be said . " brennan , who has been holding a news conference with the senate intelligence committee , says he has been working with the cia for more than a decade . " i think it â€™ s unfair to think of the detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation methods and methods that were used in the ultimate operation to go against bin laden . " brennan 's office , however , says the report was based on cia records and other evidence of torture and beatings in the interrogations of osama bin laden . the cia says it has no evidence of any involvement in the raid . the report also criticizes brennan 's acknowledgement that cia agents used techniques like waterboarding , lsd , and lsd , self-harm , and other sexual abuse . " i am very disorganized , but i have no idea what i am going to do with it , and i believe it was a terrorist act , " says the cia 's chief of staff . " i do n't know if i did anything about it . "
