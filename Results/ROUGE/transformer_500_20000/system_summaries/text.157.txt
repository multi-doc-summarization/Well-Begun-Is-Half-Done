" the move follows a wave of criticism from canadian prime minister stephen harper , who called the move a " direct rebuke " to the us and britain , japan , and some other countries . the move comes amid a backlash over the financial crisis in the wake of hurricane irma , which killed at least 20 people and injured more than 200 people , notes the new york times , which notes that canada 's prime minister , timothy geithner , was n't the only one who spoke at the g20 summit , which was a major strategic move to scrap the debt ceiling .
