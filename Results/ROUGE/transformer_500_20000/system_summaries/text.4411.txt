" the iraq war loomed , when hillary clinton proposed the federal gas tax for the summer travel season , and her network included most of the democratic party 's top policy staff , and many of the republicans had worked directly for her or her husband , writes balz . clinton " was running against an inexperienced , untested young senator named barack obama , " he writes . " but somehow , much of the gop policy establishment ended up supporting obama . "
