it 's not the first time the american military has sought to create a cargo plane in the sky , but the pentagon has decided that it is not close to constructing any smaller aircraft , cnn reports . " we want to find ways to make smaller aircraft more effective , and one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft , with minimal modification , to become 'aircraft carriers in the avengers , " says peter singer of the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa , the pentagon 's department of homeland security ) . the plan is aimed at safeguarding unmanned aerial systems and capabilities , and is expected to be approved by the pentagon next month . " it 's going to be a lot easier to get to work with the pentagon than to do with it , " singer dan patt says in a statement . " this is the float-the-idea stage of the concept . " darpa , a flying fleet of drones that look similar to predator or reaper aircraft , has built a " mothership " capable of launching a <unk> operation to coincide with the launch of the flying aircraft carrier . the defense department says it plans to use the technology to analyze the drones and determine whether they will be tested or whether they are capable of sustaining gravity .
