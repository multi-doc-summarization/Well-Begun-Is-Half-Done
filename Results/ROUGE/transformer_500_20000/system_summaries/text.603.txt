the fast-food giant says it does n't use genetically modified potatoes , the idaho statesman reports . " mcdonald 's usa does not source potatoes , nor do we have current plans to change our sourcing practices , " the company said in a statement . the company altered the potato 's dna so it produces less acrylamide , which is suspected to be a human carcinogen . potatoes naturally produce the chemical when they 're cooked at high temperatures . the potato is also engineered to resist bruising . simplot is a major supplier of french fries , hash browns , and other potato products for restaurant chains like mcdonald 's . this is n't the first time the fast-food industry has resisted potatoes . simplot spokesman doug cole did n't address the company 's plans to sell its new spud , called the " innate " potato . the ap reports that the us department of agriculture has approved idaho-based simplot co. 's genetically modified potato . the ap notes that it 's unclear how many parents are already limiting the amount of fast food that their children eat , and mcdonald 's has n't been able to pass by the golden arches in the us , but it 's not clear whether they 're interested in buying gmo foods or the gmo potato industry , which has been criticized by the media for not catching up with gmo foods .
