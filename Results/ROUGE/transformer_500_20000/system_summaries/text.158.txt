ivanka trump sent hundreds of emails discussing official white house business last year to white house aides , including cabinet officials , her father , donald trump , and others , the washington post reports . according to cbs news , trump 's emails contained logistical and personal information , some of which were taken aback by her response to trump 's use of a private email while secretary of state . the white house referred to trump as " crooked hillary " for using a personal email account . trump 's family is not commenting on the authenticity of the rules . in a statement monday , trump said the emails were mostly relayed to people with knowledge of her reaction to the practice . " i am deeply saddened by the loss of my daughter and my family , " he said . " i do n't know what to do with this . " the post reports that trump 's attorney , abbe evers , from a group called american oversight , submitted the freedom of information request that protects the trump administration from profiting from the email use of hillary clinton 's emails . the review also found that ivanka trump , who feared that she 'd be doing so , had been briefed on the rules . the post notes she was not familiar with some details , but she says she did n't contain classified information .
