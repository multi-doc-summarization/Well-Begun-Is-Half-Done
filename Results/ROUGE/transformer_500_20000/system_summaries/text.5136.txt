the tomb of a broken stone table in spain is believed to be more than 6,000 years old , according to a local archaeologist . the tomb in cristovo de cea , spain , was supposed to be a neolithic tomb in spain , but officials say it was n't even marked as an artifact . " no one told me , neither heritage nor the environmental group , " archaeologist juan barceló tells the huffington post . " the logical thing would have been for them to get in contact with the local council so that we could have taken measures to protect the site . but sometimes accidents happen . i am sure that such disasters happen in many other countries , but have not been published . it turns out barceló is partly right . other countries have destroyed ancient remains , including monuments over 100 years , are all preserved by law . " all authorities , national , state and local work effectively preserving our heritage , " barceló says . the town council was n't aware of the site 's existence , but it 's not clear if the tomb existed . " this is not representative of spain , " says the archaeologist who called the mistake a " monumental error . "
