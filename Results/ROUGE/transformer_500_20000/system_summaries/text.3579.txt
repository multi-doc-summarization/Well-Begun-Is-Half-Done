the american rock band bon jovi has pulled on its first concerts in china since 1989 , and it 's not clear whether it will be a good idea . the band 's performance permits have been cancelled , reports the guardian , which notes that bon jovi was due to play with china 's notoriously opaque ministry of culture . the band is banned in china , and bon jovi is scheduled to appear in china if they are seen as supportive of the dalai or the tibetan independence movement . " we are not aware of the situation , " says a spokesman for the band . " we do n't know what it 's going to happen . " the dalai lama has a history of cheekily posting photos of the lama in a video backdrop to a concert in taiwan , notes the new york daily news . the band has been criticized for posting a video purporting to show the bon jovi performing in front of the tibetan spiritual leader , and the daily mail has a photo of bon jovi sitting in the monk 's robes , along with maroon 5 , which is the enduring american rockers of chinese sensitivities .
