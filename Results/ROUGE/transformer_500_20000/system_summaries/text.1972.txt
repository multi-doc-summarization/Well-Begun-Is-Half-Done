" hamilton says the <unk> are covered in snow and ice sheets , and the <unk> to be repaired so it can haul supplies and equipment from the coast to mcmurdo station . the <unk> is a three-mile wide and more than 125-mile long swath of crevassed ice where the ice shelf meets the mcmurdo shelf . ( a recent study has found a lot of ice sheets . )
