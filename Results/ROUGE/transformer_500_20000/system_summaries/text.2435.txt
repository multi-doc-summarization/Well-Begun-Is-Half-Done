amy schumer is back in the news with a new sony pictures film , and it 's a doozy of a look at the live-action comedy series in which she adopts a self-deprecating tone : " when i look in the mirror i know who i am , " she says . " it â€™ s that kind of response that amy schumer has been kicked out of barbieland for not being perfect enough and lands in a real-world movie . " the film is " incidentally , working on the script , but still meant to be a family flick , " schumer says . the film 's protagonists decide to lift her head or stand upright , but it 's not clear whether schumer will be able to walk on all fours or otherwise . the movie is n't the first time schumer has made such an appearance since she was a real woman in the public eye . " i sometimes feel a bit sorry , but i do . why ? because simply by being a woman , she would have had the audacity to do so without the perfect size-zero proportions demanded by the women on our screens . "
