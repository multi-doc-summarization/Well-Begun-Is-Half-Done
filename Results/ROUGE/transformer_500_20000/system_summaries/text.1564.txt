a woman walking her dogs at the base of a tree in australia was walking her two dogs a few weeks ago when they pulled her from the koala . " obviously the koala felt very threatened because it attached itself with its mouth , jaws , to my leg and bit very hard , bit very deeply , " mary anne forster tells the brisbane times . " the koala on to forster 's leg and would not let go , causing a bite that required 12 stitches . in a desperate attempt to get the animal off her leg , she put her fingers in its mouth to get it to release its jaw . it finally released its grip and she stumbled 2km home before being admitted to hospital . the koala was taken to a hospital , where doctors determined the koala may risk serious injury , the sydney morning herald reports . " it should also be remembered that koalas are capable of defending themselves . they have sharp teeth and capable of causing deep wounds and any dog that attacks a koala , " forster says . forster , who is recovering from a broken arm and is expected to recover from surgery .
