wells fargo & co. has ordered wells fargo to pay $ 203 million for debit card transactions , reports the san francisco chronicle . the move comes after a federal judge struck down a scathing ruling that struck wells fargo with " profiteering " by changing its policies to process checks and debit purchases to go through when their accounts were cleared by the bank 's highest dollar amount , notes the wall street journal . wells fargo , citibank , chase , and union bank were among those charged in the scheme , which is based on a slew of similar lawsuits involving wells fargo and walmart . wells fargo adopted the policies beginning in 2001 , but it 's not clear how much of the money will be , reports bloomberg . " internal memos and e-mails leave no doubt that the bank would allow the bank to recoup damages , " says an attorney for the plaintiffs . " it ’ s unfair and deceptive business practices , " he says , adding that the ruling is a " slap in the face of the problem " and " profiteering in profit from the bank ’ s <unk> . "
