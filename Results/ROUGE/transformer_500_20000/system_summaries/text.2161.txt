the cia has disputed some of the reports that the cia spied on computers in secret prisons . the report is based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the ciaÂ’s headquarters in langley , va. , and the high-security work spaces on capitol hill . the cia and the national security council declined to comment on the allegations , but it 's not clear whether any part of the report will be presented , reports the new york times , which notes that white house officials have been feuding with the committee since the report was published . " the report details how the cia misled the bush administration and sent to the white house and the justice department to investigate the abuses of the cia 's detention and interrogation program , " says a spokesman for the committee . " it is a disgrace that we have not been able to identify the cia . " the mcclatchy investigation is eerily similar to that of a cia spokesman , who says that the report " carries enormous consequences for congressional oversight over the executive branch . "
