if you 're a member of the clean plate club , you 're not alone : a new study suggests that the average adult eats 92 % of whatever he or she puts on his or her plate . researchers at cornell university in france report in the international journal of obesity . " part of why we finish most of what we serve is because we are aware enough to know how much we 'll want in the first place , " says the study 's lead researcher . " we 'll eat it regardless of gender or nationality . " the researchers found that 326 participants under 18 years old were only 59 % of what they took . " this might be because kids are less certain about whether they will like a particular food , " a researcher tells bloomberg . " if you put it on your plate , it 's going into your stomach , " he says . the results were nearly identical , and the researchers were n't surprised to find a way to clean our plates . the researchers say that while the study did n't hold true with children , it was n't the first time they were given a child eats the same amount of snacks . the researchers note that the study is n't conclusive , but the researchers hope the results will be replicated in the meantime .
