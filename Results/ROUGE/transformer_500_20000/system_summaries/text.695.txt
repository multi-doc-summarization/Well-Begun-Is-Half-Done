president obama says he 's " usually accused of not being intense enough , right , " but that 's not the case . in a las vegas interview with abc news , the president said he 's ready to " fight with every fiber of my being to make sure that we continue on a path that i do n't think reflects who we are , " adding , " because i think the country needs it . " he added , " whoever wins the republican primary is going to be a standard bearer for a vision of the country . " obama also addressed the issue in a speech last week . " i think it 's always good publicity for a republican if they 're in an argument with me , " he said . " but this was really not a big deal . she wanted to give me a letter , asking for a meeting . and i said , 'we 'd be happy to meet . ' " obama , who has been doling out food stamps , echoed that sentiment in a letter to abc news . " i 'm going to fight as hard as i can with every <unk> of my <unk> . "
