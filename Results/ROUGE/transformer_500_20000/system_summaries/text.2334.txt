the mona lisa is more than 25,000 times smaller than the original , according to a new study by the georgia institute of technology . the " mini lisa " is one-third the width of a human hair , and one third of the <unk> width of the human hair . that 's roughly 0.001 inches by 21 inches , and it 's roughly 30 inches of a wide . the molecular canvas is a plastic whose surface contains active chemical sites which are initially protected by capping them with protecting molecules , the guardian reports . the molecular <unk> and tip of an atomic force microscope were able to vary the surface concentration of molecules on such short length , and the researchers say they 've found a replica of the lisa 's forehead and hands tied to the desired location of a pixel . " we 're not sure if it 's going to happen , " says one researcher . " it 's a really big deal , but it 's not a good idea . " the team says it 's " arguably the world 's most famous painting , " though it 's still a little more complicated than it is . " we have a lot of people who visit the louvre to see if there are a lot more people in the world , " a professor at mit 's hopkins university tells the journal . " it is a very small bit of a frankenstein . "
