legionnaires ' disease has spiked in the two years since flint switched its water supply from the great lakes to the flint river , the detroit free press reports . dr. eden wells , chief medical executive with the michigan department of health and human services , says the increase can not be directly attributed to the switch . " not all the people who got legionnaires ' were exposed to flint water , " lyon says in a press release . he says it 's " treating this situation with the same urgency and transparency as the lead response in the city of flint , michigan , and other states , " but it 's not clear whether the increase is related to the water emergency in flint , mich. , in 2015 . the state department says it has " public safety " to investigate the disease . " we do n't have a problem with it , and we 're going to get it done , " the director of the michigan nonprofit <unk> nonprofit tells cnn . " it 's going to be very difficult to get the water out of the water . it 's a water filtration system . it 's just a small fraction of the cases that were tested in genesee county in june 2014 . the <unk> is n't the only one to blame for the disease . " i 've never seen anything like it , " he says . " i do n't think it was a water problem . " the state 's health department says the water supply is " an increase in lead contamination " and is " a historic and instructive instructive ethics case . "
