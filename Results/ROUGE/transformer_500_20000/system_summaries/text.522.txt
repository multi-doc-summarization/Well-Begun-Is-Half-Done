" all along , we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage , " kathy gunn tells upi . " on the plain white box was a card that read , 'do not open until your 1st disagreement . ' now , there had obviously been plenty of disagreements , arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years . there were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box . " gunn says she and her husband put off opening the box despite their " first disagreement " with the facebook group that she and brandon received a gift at their kalamazoo wedding in kalamazoo , mich. , when they decided to open it until they were to attend . " i thought back to our wedding day ( nearly 9 years ago ) and i was going to get a little bit of it , " she says . " i think that we both avoided turning to the box , because it would have symbolized our failure . to us , it would be meant that we didn ’ t have what it takes to make our marriage work and we ’ re both too stubborn and determined for that . " the couple , who have been married for a decade , say they have no plans for the couple 's future plans .
