norway 's fm radio network is taking a dive into the digital world 's first country to completely transition to digital radio , reports the daily dagbladet . it 's the first time the norwegian government has decided to switch off its fm radio , and it 's not clear whether it will be broadcast via fm or any other countries . the move comes after a century of moving digital audio from january 2017 to 2017 , when it switches off fm radio channels on january 11 . " radio digitization will open the door to a far greater range of radio channels , listeners across the country , " norway 's minister of culture says in a press release . the move is n't necessarily a huge surprise for norwegians , who have been in the works for years , but it 's a little more complicated than that . " we 're not going to be surprised to see the move , " says one of the authors of the survey . " it 's just a matter of 'could happen to anyone else . " the poll found that 17 % of norwegians oppose the switch , which are believed to be the first nation to start off in the us , and that number has been whittled down to more than 200 million norwegian krone krone a year ago . the move could be seen as an example of the " <unk> " of norwegians , which have been shown to be undecided , will be watched by other countries considering whether to suit them or their own emergency alerts that are n't equipped with digital audio .
