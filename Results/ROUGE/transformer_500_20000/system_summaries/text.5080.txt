a new york restaurant has been removed from the menu after residents complained about the dish for months , reports advance media . " even with all that whipped cream you ca n't make a rape joke palatable , " says the owner of the phunky elephant in staten island . " for the record , you know to our guests nor did we mean to make anyone feel uncomfortable or insulted . " the restaurant 's owner , patricia gaja , says the dessert is " a flip response , " but it 's not clear whether it 's a rape or sexual assault . gaja says it 's " gotten out of hand " to joke about a type of reckless or negligent behavior by presenting the desert at question . in a statement , marie cappello notes that the restaurant has " did not intend to create an impression of reckless behavior that often leads to rape . " she says the reference was harmful because it normalized " roofies " as a date rape drug , making it acceptable . but the restaurant says the criticism had been " overwhelmingly positive , " and it was " disingenuous " at the restaurant .
