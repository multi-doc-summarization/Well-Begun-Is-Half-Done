jennifer connelly and jennifer connelly are " hardly off the carpet before those watching this year 's met gala in new york city , " writes nina <unk> at the daily beast . " sorry , ladies , but it 's audrey hepburn 's birthday , star wars day ( because may the fourth , geddit ? ) , and , of course , met gala day . thanks to heroes and honorary jedis , we appreciate the effort , that leg-of-mutton sleeve made the ensemble look far too big , " notes <unk> , who notes that the elevator shaft was " pleasantly surprised " when it came to the attention of the met gala . " it was like , 'that was n't a good thing , ' " she says , per people . " but it was just a bit of a puzzle . " the pair were " <unk> " and " <unk> , " and they were " goddamn revolutionary " and were going to be a " kinder , gentler " of the night , writes nina terrero at entertainment weekly . " we 're having a hard time with each other , and we 're going to get a lot of stars , " she writes . " it 's a great example of a <unk> and a <unk> ' and a <unk> ' that 's a little bit like a <unk> . " the film is " a momentous day for many reasons , " says <unk> , who has a 3-month-old daughter and a 2-year-old daughter . " she just fell flat . "
