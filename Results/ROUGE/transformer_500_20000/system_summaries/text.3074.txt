" it â€™ s not clear how many of these leads are , " says lead author hilda <unk> . " it 's a very simple question , but it 's not necessarily a good idea . " the researchers say the study is based on a number of questions about desire , reporting in the guardian that the study 's lead author is " a little bit of a puzzle " to determine whether the fruit 's health effects are linked to higher levels of arousal and satisfaction .
