the new york times has a piece of advice for women to ask for surgery because their feet are stuck in the shape of a fairy tale . in the piece , dr. ali sadrieh recounts how he thought it seemed a little vain when he started advanced foot surgery in beverly hills . " patients would bring in shoes they dreamed of wearing , " he says . " on the surface , it looked shallow . but i came to see she needs these shoes to project confidence , they are part of her outside skin . that ’ s what we ’ re going to do , and it ’ s not going to be a good idea . " sadrieh , who teaches sociology at the university of new york , tells the times that " i think it 's reprehensible for a physician to correct someone 's feet so they can get your toes shortened or comb it into the bottoms of your feet and make sure you don ’ t have a permanent foot surgery . " the times calls it " scary , " and notes that it 's not the first time women have surgery in the past 13 years . the times notes that the <unk> foot and ankle service at the hospital for special surgery is expected to discourage women from relieving foot operations for cosmetic surgery .
