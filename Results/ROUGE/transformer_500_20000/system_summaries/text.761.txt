a new study suggests that low concentrations of an antidepressant can disrupt the courtship of songbirds. that 's problematic because birds that are slow to find a mate may not get the chance to breed , reports the washington post . researchers at the university of york say they 've found that prozac enters the environment via sewage and has been detected at wastewater treatment plants . " we ’ re definitely not saying that it ’ bad to take antidepressants , but certainly there is a greater need for new technologies to clean out sewage , " says lead researcher kathryn arnold . the study found that birds like to graze at sewage treatment plants were teeming with worms and maggots , she adds . the study , published in plos one , found that female starlings had been exposed to small doses of fluoxetine , which are frequently used to make their way through the human body and into sewage plants without fully breaking down , those insects would have had prescription drugs . " it ’ s been well-documented that a decreased sex drive boosted attractiveness , adding to growing evidence that environmental concentrations can alter important traits related to individual fitness and population dynamics , " arnold says . " if we don ’ t have an antidepressant reduced attractiveness . "
