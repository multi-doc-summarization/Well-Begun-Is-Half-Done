a week after the newtown massacre , the journal news published an interactive map with the names and addresses of gun permit owners in select new york cities . the map will be updated when it comes to a transparency arms race , which has been co-opted for fierce partisanship . " i don ’ t know whether the journal ’ s publisher janet hasson is a permit holder herself , but here ’ s how to find her to ask , " she writes in the new york times . she says that while she has been deluged with messages like " a google maps satellite image of the publisher ’ s home , " it ’ s not going to happen . " she says she has n't been able to track her movements down to the journal , and that she has no plans to make amends with the publisher . the map , which covers the state 's tri-state area and the area of the city , has a long history of violence and violence among young people in the state , the times reports . " we ’ re not talking about it , but we ’ ve got a lot of people who have been hurt , " says the director of the center for public safety . " we have to find out where this is going . "
