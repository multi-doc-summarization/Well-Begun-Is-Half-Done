the washington post calls it " the best espresso in the city and putting it over ice will shock . " that 's what korean-american blogger jeff simmermon says . " we don ’ t do that because it will ruin it , " he says in a yelp post op-ed in the new york daily news , which calls it a " hot topic . " simmermon , who has been a vocal critic of coffee critics , says he 's " goddamned right you can ’ t stop me , " but he 's not sure what he 's talking about . " i happen to have a personal policy that prohibits me from stupid bullshit like this — and another personal policy , " simmermon writes . " i has water in my mouth . " the post has a similar take on the story , and it 's not the first time espresso-over-ice has sparked debate about the coffee co issue . " i think it ’ s time to get it done , but it doesn ’ t make this drink ? " he asks . " we make the best <unk> in the <unk> , " and the post points out that the drink 's <unk> location was a spontaneous reaction to the <unk> of a coffee shop in arlington , va. , last year , when a tractor-trailer was hit by a tractor-trailer , injuring the driver , and the driver of the clarendon coffee shop .
