the un ' highest court of justice has rejected claims of genocide by serbia and croatia over atrocities committed during the 1990s , the bbc reports . according to the bbc , the croatian town of vukovar was devastated when it was occupied by serbs for three months in 1991 . according to a professor at london 's school of justice , more than 200,000 people were killed in the war . the ruling was posted on the heels of the croatian war of secession . “ the strongest arguments they have to say they are justifying their wars is that they were defending their citizens against genocide , ” gordy says . the bbc notes that the government has long ruled that genocide was a violation of the 1948 genocide convention . the government says it will rule on genocide if it finds either side violated the genocide or violence . the government argues the genocide occurred in bosnia , where more than 100 people were detained and killed , and the number of people killed in that period has been halved over the past four years . in the past 16 years , the international court of homeland security says the ruling is based on a " lack of evidence .
