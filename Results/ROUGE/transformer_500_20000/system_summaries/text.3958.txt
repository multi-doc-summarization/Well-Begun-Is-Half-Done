pete sessions says he was dropping out of the race for house majority leader eric cantor in a historic primary loss on tuesday . " after thoughtful consideration and discussion with my colleagues , i have made the decision to not continue my run for majority leader , " sessions said in a statement . " today , it became obvious to me that the measures necessary to run a successful campaign would have created unnecessary and painful division within our party . at this critical time , we must remain unified as a republican conference . as always , i stand ready and willing to work with our team to advance the conservative agenda that the american people demand and deserve . " sessions is the only lawmaker known to be lobbying for the no . 2 republican position in the house of representatives , and former head of the house gop campaign committee says he plans to schedule the secret election just over a week after cantor 's announcement that he would step down . mccarthy , who is expected to be the next house speaker next week , has been expected to replace eric cantor as the house rules committee chairman .
