a faith ministry in nebraska has started a fundraising campaign to buy out four stores that sell millions of cans of beer each year in a tiny village next to a south dakota indian reservation plagued by alcoholism . the lakota hope street ministry in whiteclay is looking to raise at least $ 6.3 million to close the stores , which are only about 200 yards from the pine indian reservation . the officially dry reservation is plagued by high rates of alcohol syndrome and encompasses some of the nation 's poorest counties . whiteclay only has about a dozen residents , yet the stores have remained opened for decades despite state investigations into alleged liquor violations , lawsuits and protests that occasionally turned violent . ministry founder bruce bonfleur and his wife have lived in whiteclay for nearly two decades , feeding people on the streets and launching programs designed to help members of the oglala sioux tribe . bonfleur said he has talked with the businesses , and " we believe that the beer store owners are ready to sell out . " the stores will also provide an online store where our local artists can establish a more reliable income and teaching/mentoring opportunities . still , some activists have their doubts . olowan martinez , an oglala activist who has led protests against whiteclay , tells the ap that she would be thrilled but shocked if the buyout worked as intended .
