president obama 's honeymoon ends in the wake of the sequester , and it 's not the first time he 's been elected president . the washington post-abc news poll found that 44 % of americans say they would like the two sides to work together to come up with a deal to stop the cuts , while 44 % say they are feeling no impact on their lives , and fewer than half expect a toll on the sequester . the poll also found that americans in congress have confidence in both sides amid a sense of continuing dysfunction in washington , which has n't been seen since the last few years . " neither ‚Äù has ticked up into double digits , " says one respondent . " the desire for cooperation is widely shared across party lines . " the sequester is n't going to be a big deal , but it 's a far cry for the president , writes greg sargent at the atlantic . " if the public approves of it , we 'll be able to make it clear that it will not be a good day to be re-elected . "
