the texas state board of education approved a resolution today that requires publishers to correct a " pro-islamic/anti-christian bias " in future world history , reports the austin american-statesman . " what we 're trying to do is prohibit and send a clear message to the publishers that [ the bias ] should not happen in the future , " board member terri miller said in a statement . " it is a cosmetic exercise . " the resolution will ensure that potential biases are taken care of before these books reach the board , " an attachment to the resolution cited a past investment by the dubai royal family in a major us textbook publisher . the resolution , which increased investment by " middle easterners " in the publishing industry could encourage biased treatment of religion in the texts used in texas schools . the resolution is not legally binding on publishers , but does state the will of board members to have more balanced social studies books . opponents who tried to derail the resolution say they 're whitewashing the policy . " this is hard not to imagine what publishers , which must abide by state policy or probably forfeit significant sales , can include in textbooks . "
