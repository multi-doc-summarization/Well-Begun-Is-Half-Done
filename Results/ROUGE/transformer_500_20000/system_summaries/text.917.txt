the fcc has released the final draft of its proposal to destroy net neutrality ruling a " misguided and legally flawed approach. , " reports usa today . the proposal revolves around isps like google , and an isp would need to " facilitate critical broadband investment and innovation by removing regulatory uncertainty and lowering compliance , " notes the wall street journal . " the ftc has to be at least somewhat accepting of them — a court has already ruled that blocking those things outright would treat internet providers like common carriers ; and since this proposal removes the common carrier designation from internet providers , that won ’ t be allowed . net neutrality supporters have long argued that these policies could unfairly advantage ’ s own content . " in the proposal , the fcc says it 's " unlikely that any isp , except the very largest , could exercise market power in negotiations with google or netflix , " writes greg sargent at the washington post . it 's not clear whether isps will still have to answer the ftc 's proposal , but if they do decide to do so , it 's a moot point .
