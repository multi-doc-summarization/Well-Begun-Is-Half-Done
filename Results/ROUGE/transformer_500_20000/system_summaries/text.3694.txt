joe miller , the iraq war veteran who received the backing of former alaska gov . sarah palin , emerged from the election tuesday night with a narrow lead over murkowski and joe miller . " we are looking right now to make sure that the votes are accounted for fairly , without any type of game play , " miller told fox business network . " it concerns us any time somebody lawyers up and tries to pull an al franken , if you will . we are very concerned that there may be some attempt here to get out of this primary . " miller , who is leading murkowski to maintain his lead with the help of absentee ballots in the primary , is expected to be the first primary in the state since the election , politico reports . " if sen. murkowski is going to keep her word , she 's going to <unk> if the voters decide that in fact i prevail in this election , " he said , adding that he would n't think about a third-party candidacy or an independent write-in effort if she wins . the alaska division of elections , meanwhile , has released the first detailed breakdown of the remaining ballots .
