tom patton , the ohio house of representatives-7th district , has been running for office because she is a young mother . " the gal that 's running against me is a 30-year-old , you know , mom , mother of two infants , " said patton in a radio interview . " and i do n't know if anybody explained to her we 've got to spend three nights a week in columbus . so , how does that work out for you ? umm , i waited until i was 48 and my kids were raised , and at least adults , before we took the opportunity to try . " patton , who has two sons , ages 1 and 3 , tells the new york times that he is " insulting and discriminatory , " noting that politicians such as former alaska gov . mary taylor and sarah palin are n't the only ones who do n't want to do so . " how does work out ? i want to tell her , 'hey sweetie , i just got 27 % of the pie in just my district , which is nine times what should have been done , " he says . " i think it 's unfair to think that 's what i do . "
