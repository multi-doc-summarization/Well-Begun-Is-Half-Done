president xi jinping was supposed to be the world 's first annual internet forum at microsoft 's satya nadella 's us tour monday , and it was n't the first time he 's seen in a foreign language , the washington post reports . " i consider that a meaningful personal milestone , " zuckerberg said in a facebook post . " on a personal note , this was the most memorable moment and maybe the most important was watching $ 2.5 trillion of american corporate power pay homage to the chinese president . " the post notes that xi , who has been in the tech world since mid-december , has a history of cheekily posting a pic of himself holding a few shots at the microsoft headquarters in redmond , wash. , before posing for a group of super powerful people in the world . the photo was taken by microsoft co-founder jeff bezos , who tweeted that he had been " flattered " by the photo . the post has since been viewed more than 100 times as of this writing , with many wondering who would turn up at the trip . the post reports that zuckerberg has been a staunch advocate of sorts for the internet , including many of apple 's tim cook and amazon 's jeff bezos .
