voyager 1 has just entered a new region at the far reaches of our solar system , according to a written statement from nasa partner johns hopkins applied physics lab . the " immense bubble containing our magnetic field , solar wind , and the bubble of charged particles that originate from inside our heliosphere , " writes ed stone at caltech . it 's a " new region of the universe , " he notes , but it 's still inside the magnetic field of the sun . " it 's not a huge surprise to say goodbye . " the heliosphere is the final region to cross before reaching interstellar space in interstellar space . scientists are calling it a highway because it lets particles in and out of the solar system to zoom out and allows higher-energy particles from outside . the heliosphere are expected to take a closer look at the sun 's magnetic field lines , and it will be seen as a " magnetic highway " that has been skirting the edge of a solar system for a long time now . " this road will lead voyager out to cross the sun , " stone says . " if you don ’ t know what it ’ s going to happen , you ’ re going to find it . " ( nasa has a similar plan . )
