scientists have discovered a bit of fossilized brain tissue from a dinosaur that lived 130 million years ago , and it 's the first such discovery in the history of such a species , reports npr . " he picked it up and noticed that it was slightly unusual in its shape and its texture , " says alex liu of the university of cambridge . " there 's a series of bumps to this specimen that are quite characteristic of it fitting into the brain case of a dinosaur . " the fossil was found in 2004 near bexhill in the united kingdom . it 's believed to have been a species similar to iguanodon , but researchers say it 's possible that neanderthals were adept at hunting and digging away within the original brain , reports the new york times , which notes that the study is " actually mineralization of some of the soft tissue structures that were preserved before they decayed away . " it 's not clear what triggered the discovery , but a study published in the geological society of london suggests the dinosaur likely from the cretaceous period as a result of a collision in the early 20th century , reports national geographic . ( a study found that the dinosaur 's brains are more likely to survive . )
