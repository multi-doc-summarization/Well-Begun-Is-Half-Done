rats may be able to pee bladder control , but a new study out of the university of neuroscience suggests they 've made progress in repairing spinal cord injuries , the bbc reports . researchers say the rats regained some bladder control after surgery to transplant nerve cells into the spinal cord , which could raise hopes for one day treating patients with more independence . " this is a very big deal , " researcher john mcdonald says in a press release . " our technique works and does not apply to humans . " the study found that bladder control restored the function of scar tissue as the body 's responds to injury , the guardian reports . the researchers say that while the study is the first to regenerate nerves that restore bladder control in animals with spinal cord damage , the team hopes to trial the method on larger animals first . researchers say it will take several years of research before human clinical trials can be completed , and the results are expected to be published in the proceedings of the royal krieger institute . " if we can show in a larger animal , it 's going to be easier to get a little more complicated than it has to do with it , and it 's not going to make it easier for them to get it done , " he says .
