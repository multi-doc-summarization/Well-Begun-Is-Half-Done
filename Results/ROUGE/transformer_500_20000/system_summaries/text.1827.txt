" it 's not much , but it 's something , " said olson , 16 , who works at wagner 's european bakery and cafe in olympia . " many workers around the country wo n't be as lucky as residents of washington state , which is raising its minimum wage to $ 2 an hour less in 2013 than their living just one state to the west . " but the extra pennies she 'll earn in 2013 will add up over the coming weeks and months , " she tells the washington post . olson says it 's difficult to make ends meet , and that 's because it 's the highest state in the country . the state has approved that increase in the past year , and nine states are expected to increase the minimum wage for the first time in five years , reports npr . the state 's wage increases to 35 % , and the number of people who do n't want to get a bump is expected to climb .
