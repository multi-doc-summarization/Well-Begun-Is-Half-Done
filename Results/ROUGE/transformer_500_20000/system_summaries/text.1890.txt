george takei has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage by claiming slavery was a " clown in blackface , " but he 's not a fan of it , he tells the new york times . " it 's literally nonsense . i have expressed my full thoughts on the matter here . i do n't even know what he ’ s getting at . 4 . i feel justice thomas has abdicated , and let ’ s pause you right there . " takei , a japanese-american internment of which is a survivor of the supreme court , says the term is " not racist , " and it 's a " lesser theatrical term , " notes the washington post , which has a similar take on takei 's past in the past . " if you don ’ t have a racist remark , you ’ re going to have to say , 'this isn ’ t a racist , but you ’ ve got a lot of people who are going to be <unk> , ' and we ’ re all going to get a little bit of a <unk> . ' "
