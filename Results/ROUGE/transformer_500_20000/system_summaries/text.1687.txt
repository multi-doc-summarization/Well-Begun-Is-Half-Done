georgia senator saxby chambliss wins re-election in 2014 rather than seek a third term , reports the atlanta journal-constitution . in a statement picked up by politico , the senator said he was confident he would have won re-election . " instead , this is about frustration and anger anytime soon , " he wrote . " it 's just a question of whether any of the folks interested in taking him on can run a strong enough campaign to take advantage of that vulnerability . only 38 % of republican primary voters say they want to be their nominee next year , compared to 43 % who would prefer someone more conservative . " the primary result is a huge margin of error in his decision , but it was n't clear if the decision was genuine . " i don ’ t see the legislative gridlock and partisan posturing and partisan improving , " says cain , who has been a vocal supporter of the republican party since the election . " the debt-ceiling debacle of 2011 and the election showed congress at its worst and , sadly , i ’ m going to have to do it . "
