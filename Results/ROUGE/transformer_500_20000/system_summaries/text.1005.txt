a minneapolis airlines jet made an emergency landing at the st paul airport monday morning after a passenger tried to open a door at the rear of the 737 , the minneapolis star tribune reports . " he kept stopping to go into his bag and then i watched him take a pill out of his bag , " alaska airlines spokeswoman melinda iverson says . " she was very calm , and just said , you know , â€˜ sir , come stay with me in the back , we can talk through ' " iverson , a passenger who was sitting next to him on the plane , says he was acting oddly even as they boarded the plane . the flight was diverted to minneapolis-st. paul airport in new york , and the flight attendant was taken off the plane . the passenger , who estimates to be in his 20s was quiet and seemed to be falling asleep until the delay . " she handled it so well , " she says . she says he plans to cancel his flight and get off the flight . the flight attendants were sort of eying a return to minneapolis , where they were being treated for minor injuries .
