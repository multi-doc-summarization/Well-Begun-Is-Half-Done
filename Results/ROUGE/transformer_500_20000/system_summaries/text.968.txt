north carolina lawmakers have approved a bill greatly expanding where concealed handguns are legally allowed , reports the detroit free press . the bill passed by the house and senate on tuesday , and it 's not clear whether the measure will have concealed-carry permit holders to bring their weapons to bars and restaurants that serve alcohol although they are not supposed to consume alcohol carry them in funeral processions and allow them to keep firearms locked in their car when parked on college or public school campuses . " you can have difference in outcomes in wake county versus other parts of the bill will allow concealed handgun permits from public view , " says rep. jacqueline schaffer , the republican congressman who sponsored the bill . " other parts " of the measure say it 's " no uniformity of practices now , " reports the sacramento bee . the bill is expected to pass a bill that would have done away with north carolina 's system of requiring a handgun purchase for those who want to buy a pistol but do n't hold a concealed handgun permit . the bill also strengthens penalties for firearms who violate firearms laws , such as mental health problems .
