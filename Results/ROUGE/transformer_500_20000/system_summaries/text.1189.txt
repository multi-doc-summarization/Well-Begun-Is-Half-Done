keith olbermann will host a prime time program for current tv , the new york times reports . the move comes after a public relations agency hired by al gore and joel hyatt , who will be at least one partner in olbermann 's future media plans . " we are delighted to provide keith with the independent platform and freedom that current can , and does offer , " gore said in a statement . " nothing is more vital to my concept of a free media than news that is produced independently of corporate interference . and thus i 'm pleased to announce that i 'll be returning to television on current media . " the move follows a tuesday morning conference call for an announcement that olbermann would have an equity stake in current tv . the wall street journal , meanwhile , has a searchable archive that will air tomorrow in the spring . the journal 's take : " the people who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized by their employers to comment in advance of the official announcement , and they did not deny that the channel , which counts former vice president al gore as one of the fastest-growing television networks in history , and its opportunity to partner with al and joel and mark rosenthal makes this truly the most exciting venture in my career .
