if you put solar panels on your roof in the northern hemisphere , you should point them within 30 degrees of true south to generate the most energy in the course of a year , according to a new study . researchers at the pecan street research institute did a study of homes with solar panels in the austin , texas , and found that when homeowners faced solar west west they were able to generate 2 % more electricity in a day , the study found . the study , published in national geographic , found that people may do better at covering their own electrical use and reducing stress on utility grids during peak demand periods by 65 % to 54 % . the study also found that facing west may actually add up over the life of solar panels , the guardian reports . the researchers found that panels should always face south , but the study did n't show that much electricity generated by the panels . " it 's not going to happen , " researcher rolf <unk> says . " but it 's a very good idea . " the researchers say they 're working on the project , which is based on energy management systems , the washington post reports .
