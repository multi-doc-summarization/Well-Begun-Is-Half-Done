" the value of a comparable variable for stock awards ( not adjusted for fair value ) grew by nearly $ 1 million , " says a researcher . " to compensate for the missing data , we relied on trends in the cost of ceo compensation to fall ( in contrast , ceos ) and other factors . " the report also found that the average worker in the top 0.1 % peaked at 0.3 % , reports marketwatch . that 's because the percentage of firms were missing in the early 2000s , while the wage of their average worker was 20 % higher than that of 2000 .
