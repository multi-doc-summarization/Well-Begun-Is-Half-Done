boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev has become the 62nd inmate on federal death row , reports the boston globe . he was sentenced to death in june for helping his older brother carry out the city . the filing says even on social media jurors would have seen friends and relatives posting about the 2013 bombing , which killed three people and injured more than 260 . tsarnaev was convicted of 30 federal charges in the bombing , and the ap reports that he will be the youngest person to die . the ap notes that the sentence is constitutional , but the majority opinion in that very same case opened with the declaration that " continuous and unrelenting publicity about the defendant and his family , wrenching stories prevented him from getting an impartial hearing in the city . " the lawyers argue a recent supreme court ruling about the vagueness of the definition of a " crime of violence " was applied to tsarnaev 's actions , and that the justice department could attempt to fast-track a new trial for tsarnaev . tsarnaev 's lawyers say the trial should have been held outside the city .
