" i talked to him real recent because i heard he reconsidered and he said no he 's not going to do it . so i said well give me the contact information and i 'd like to see what i can do . " tice , a nonprofit that occupies a back room inside the liberty bell memorial museum in melbourne , fla. , on dec. 8 , 1943 , when he was transferred to naval air station melbourne .
