india 's government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat , eggs and lusty thoughts . doctors say the advice is preposterous , and even dangerous , considering india 's already-poor record with maternal mortality , with 174 of every 100,000 resulting in the mother 's death in 2015 , reports the ap . " the government is doling out purification , having sex on auspicious days and after conception , " says one of the authors of the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of ayush 's prescription for pregnant women in india . women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally indian households , and malnutrition , or iron deficiency , are key factors in india 's 27 per 100,000 or the united states ' 14 per 100,000 , according to unicef . that 's about the same size as the maternal mortality rate of 205 maternal deaths , which is still far worse than china 's 27 <unk> . the ap notes that the number of babies born each year is <unk> , and that number includes <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almonds .
