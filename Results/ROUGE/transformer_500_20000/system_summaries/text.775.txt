liverpool team-mate fabio aurelio , 22 , has been carrying his injury since the league 's robin van persie announced his intention to visit her and undergo her placenta therapy on his ruptured ankle ligaments . the independent reports that johnson and aurelio are both doubtful for saturday 's key game against manchester city , with the independent reporting that both were on their way to see kovacevic . " it seems that even the arch-rationalist benitez has decided that she can help him solve his injury problems . i hope it will help , " johnson tells the independent . " but the controversy surrounding kovacevic 's methods are likely to intensify after it was claimed in serbia that she uses human fluid to treat patients rather than cow fluid . it is supposed to strengthen the damaged muscles and ligaments and help speed up recovery time . " the independent notes johnson 's placenta was coated with a placenta and then massaging it into the injury . the independent has a photo of the woman who made famous this week when she went to belgrade to get treatment from the tesla airport , which has been criticized for her safety violations .
