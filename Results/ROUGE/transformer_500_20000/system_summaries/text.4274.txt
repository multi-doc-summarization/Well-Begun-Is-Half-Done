bernie sanders says he 's not one of those sons of multimillionaires whose parents told them they were going to become president of the united states . " if there 's somebody else who appears who can , for whatever reason , do a better job than me , i ’ ll work my ass off to elect him or her , " he tells new york magazine . " if it turns out that i am the best candidate to beat donald trump , then i will probably run. ” sanders , who is ill at ease , talks in private much as he does in front of a microphone , except with a lot more sarcasm . " i don ’ t wake up in the morning with any burning desire that i have to be president , " sanders says , per politico . " [ i ] think their positions and motivations can rarely be disentangled from their funding . " the sanders camp , meanwhile , has a similar theme : " harry , have you seen my crowds ? " the washington post notes that the sanders campaign is " looking at " the possibility of a 2020 run . "
