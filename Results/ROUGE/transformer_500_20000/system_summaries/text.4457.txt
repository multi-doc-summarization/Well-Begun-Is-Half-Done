lindsey graham stopped by the " politics and pies " forum in new hampshire this week , and he 's got a lot of attention : " until we restore these defense cuts , we are not leaving town until we fix this . i would literally use the military to keep them in if i had to . we 're not gon na let congress leave town , " he said , per the washington post . " i would n't let congress town until <unk> we restore the intel cuts . " graham , who is announcing his plans to stage a coup in 2016 , is proposing that his first act as president would be to use the force to force the legislative branch to pass his agenda . " in other words , i regret that i am only able to respond personally to inquiries from carolinians . " the post notes that the military spending is absolutely necessary to defeat isis forces abroad , and it 's not clear whether graham will use the term " <unk> " to force congress to reverse budgetary cuts to the defense and intel efforts . the post points out graham 's comments were n't exactly an endorsement of restoring defense cuts .
