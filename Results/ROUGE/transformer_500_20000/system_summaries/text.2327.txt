the standing committee of correspondents , which controls membership in the senate daily press gallery , has been set aside , and it 's no longer tied to the editorial independence . the new york times and usa today report that breitbart operated out of bannon 's residence at the white house on april 9 , 2017 , when bannon walks on the lawn upon arrival , and the news outlet notes that it would give them access to the capitol that expire at the end of may . " capitol correspondents committee declines to credential breitbart news ’ s credential process and declined to extend the organization ’ s temporary credentials to cover congress , " breitbart ceo larry solov says in a tuesday tweet . the committee , which permits media access to u.s. capitol only to outlets it considers legitimate news organizations , is not political advocacy or other groups . " we ’ re going to have a lot of time to do with it and we don ’ t know what it ’ s going to happen to them in a way that they ’ re not going to be able to do it . "
