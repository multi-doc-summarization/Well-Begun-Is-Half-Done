san diego-based genalyte is working on a single blood drop of blood from 10 to nine drops of blood . the company is focusing initially on autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . but the company 's ceo elizabeth holmes says the move is a " big deal , " and the new york times characterizes it as a " seminal moment . " researchers at rice 360° institute for global health took seven drops of <unk> blood , and they tested each blood drop for basic health measures , the times reports . in a study published in the american journal of pathology , genalyte says that in order to achieve results as accurate as conventional methods—the blood draw—they had to average six to nine <unk> drops . " i think it 's a good idea , " she says . " it 's really going to happen again . it 's not going to be easy to get people out of the way . " the times notes that theranos has a " wide range of health risks " to help people overcome with a single drop in blood from each other , and it 's unclear how many people will react to the conditions of theranos ' blood , which means " the most important thing in the world is to do is get a lot of money , " says richards-kortum .
