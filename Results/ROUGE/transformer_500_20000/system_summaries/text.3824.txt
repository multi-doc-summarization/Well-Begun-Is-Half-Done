the house intelligence committee has voted to release a democratic rebuttal to a gop memo that democrats say undermines allegations by president trump and his allies that the fbi abused its powers while investigating his campaign . the democratic document aims to counter the republican document , which accused the fbi and justice department of abusing their authority in monitoring a onetime trump campaign associate . trump has five days to review the request to release the memo since last week , when republicans decided to make public their own classified document over the objections of the fbi . republicans â€™ memo , spearheaded by committee chairman devin nunes , claimed the fbi relied on a disputed dossier compiled by a former british spy to convince a court in october 2016 to grant a surveillance warrant for former trump campaign adviser carter page . they said fbi agents improperly failed to disclose that the spy , christopher steele , had been financed by the campaign of hillary clinton and the democratic national committee for the research . but democrats have said the fbi did mention a potential political bias in its application , reports the washington post .
