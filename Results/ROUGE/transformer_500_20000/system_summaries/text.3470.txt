" the ad is only insensitive to debbie stabenow , " he wrote in a facebook post . " it hits debbie dab between the eyes where she is vulnerable with the voters of michigan . i ’ m excited . it has started the debate. ” hoekstra , a republican running for michigan 's economy , tells the holland ad that the asian-american community is a major contributor because it " chose to use harmful stereotypes that encourage anti-asian sentiment , " the hill reports . " this is a time when the people of michigan and across the country are fed up with the spending , " hoekstra says . " this ad is not a nasty hoekstra at all . in 2010 , michigan 's asian-americans made up 2.4 % of the state 's population , up 35 % from 2000 . it is very disturbing . "
