scientists are virtually certain that california will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years , the ap reports . the last mega-quake to hit southern california was a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 1857 . " it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few well-separate faults , but with a vast interconnected fault system , " says ned field , lead author of the us geological survey . he says the quake hit a populated area 89 times more energy than the previous estimates , and it 's more likely than previously thought . scientists say the quake could be devastating because the quake would n't affect much of the earthquake 's atmosphere , but it could be as early as next month . scientists believe the quake is more likely to hit california in the fall , though it is n't clear if it 's a genuine danger to the region 's future . " if you do n't know what to do with it , you 're going to have to go to the wrong place , and you 're not going to be able to find it in a long way . "
