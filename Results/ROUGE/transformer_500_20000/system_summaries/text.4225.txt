the supreme court of appeals has ruled that corporal punishment in public schools is a no-no , but it 's not the first time the state has seen such cases as spanking or slapping , reports the new york times . in a speech at the university of texas last week , the justices cited sonia sotomayor 's opinion on the issue , noting that " the american academy of pediatrics recommends that parents be encouraged and assisted in the development of methods other than spanking for managing behavior , " and that it " has potentially deleterious side effects , " reports the san francisco chronicle . in other words , she wrote , " i do n't beat the kids like we used to . " she wrote that she was " shocked " and " horrified " when she learned that she 'd been raped by a school connection . " i think it 's a good idea , " she said , adding that she 's " very proud " of the decision . " it 's the right decision to make this happen , " says sonia sotomayor . " it is a lot of people who are going to be raped and murdered . " she says she 's been raped and molested as a child . " i 'm going to die . i 'm not going to kill anybody . " she adds that she has no history of mental illness or violence against children because of the " lack of sexual abuse " of children and children . " we are not the only ones who can do this . " ( a recent study found corporal punishment is a means of discipline . )
