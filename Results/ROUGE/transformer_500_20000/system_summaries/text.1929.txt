the toronto zoo has launched a youtube video that purports to show a woman jumping the barrier in front of a tiger 's pen . the woman can be heard shouting , " you 're a bad example to everyone else 's kids , " the zoo says in a statement picked up by the cbc . " another woman can then be seen intervening to break up the argument . she jumped into a tiger cage . are [ you ] kidding me ? " the man , identified as punishment for the suspect , will be at the discretion of toronto zoo 's ceo john tracogna . " it was very irresponsible of this individual to jump over the boardwalk and [ she could have easily injured herself by exciting the animal in this way , " she says . " the situation could have been much worse . " no zoo staff were at the scene , but the zoo is encouraging any witnesses or suspects to come forward . the zoo has yet to identify who the suspect is . ( a chihuahua chased by a second fence and tried to stop it . )
