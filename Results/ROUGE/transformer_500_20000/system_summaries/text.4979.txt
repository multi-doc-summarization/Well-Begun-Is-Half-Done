" when they stood up to him , they paid the price . they were punished even more in terms of other types of mistreatment , " the statement reads . " we have no independent knowledge of the facts and are therefore unable to comment . " the lawsuit claims leukert " continually tried getting mr. cagnina to go skinny dipping with female employees " who were the plaintiff 's subordinates , but cagnina says the suit is " absurd , " per the hollywood reporter . the lawsuit filed in los angeles superior court , which accuses peterson of throwing one of the men down to the parking lot while working for hooters in a simulated sex act with the plaintiff in front of others . " this matter involves a franchised location and its employees in california , " hooters says in a statement , per the new york daily news . the lawsuit says peterson was fired with no explanation as to why he was also let go , which his attorney says has been " terminated " by the supervisor .
