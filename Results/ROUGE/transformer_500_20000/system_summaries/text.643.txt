the canadian judicial council has recommended his removal from the federal court of canada 's judicial office , the guardian reports . robin camp issued a statement thursday saying he will resign after the canadian council 's ruling reads " so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality , integrity and independence of the judicial role of executing the judicial office . " justice minister frank addario said the comment was " unforgivable , " adding that he had been " generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months , particularly my legal team . " the canadian government 's report called camp 's conduct a rape trial in the face of a " barbaric act , " the washington post reports . camp , who was presiding over the incident , says it was n't necessary to preserve his job as a result of an investigation into the incident . " i would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments , " camp said in a statement , per the guardian . " i thank everyone for counselling and education , and i am grateful for the sacrifice of all the people who did not keep their knees together , " he said . the judge , however , said the ruling was justified because the judge did n't keep the judge 's removal from a national disciplinary hearing . " the judge has not decided whether the judge will resign , but the decision is expected to change the outcome of the ruling .
