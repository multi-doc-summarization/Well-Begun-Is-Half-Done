susan carland , wife of the project host , is donating $ 1 for hateful tweets from australian muslims . " sometimes i ’ d respond to them , and i felt like none of that really achieved , " she writes in the guardian . " i am just a blank canvas onto which they can project their own prejudices and fantasies about muslims . " carland , who has been married since 2002 , says she hopes to take over the nation 's halal meat pie at a time when it comes to " <unk> , " and it 's not clear how many of those tweets will be addressed . " i think about these things , or any other ; i am muslim , and it ’ s a good thing to do . " she adds , " it 's time to get a lot of hate on twitter , " but i do n't know what i actually believe . " she also points to a " <unk> " in her own words : " what about i try to repel it with something better , with something good ? " she asks . " i donate a dollar to unicef ? children in need , it doesn ’ t get much nicer than it is . "
