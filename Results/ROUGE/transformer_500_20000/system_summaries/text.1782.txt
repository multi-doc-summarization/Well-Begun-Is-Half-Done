scientists believe they 've discovered the first examples of air pollution traveling through the lungs of pregnant women and into their placentas , potentially reaching their fetuses . " we do not know whether the particles we found could also move across routes if you are not pregnant . i avoid roads when i walk to the hospital , " the lead researcher tells cnn . " it is a worrying problem there is a public health catastrophe . " the study , published in december , found that sooty particles had made their way into their lungs and lodge in midair . the placenta allows oxygen and nutrients to pass into the fetus 's body , but the researchers say that 's not enough for the infant to have an effect on the placenta . the study also found that air pollution significantly increases the risk of premature birth and low birth weight loss , the guardian reports . researchers say the particles do n't need to be replicated in fetuses , but they 're not aware of any such risk . " it 's always good if possible to take less polluted routes , " says a researcher . " we also know that the particles are not going to be effective , but our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible . "
