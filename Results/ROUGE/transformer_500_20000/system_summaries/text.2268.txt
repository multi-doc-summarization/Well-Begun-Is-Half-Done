four women who received womb transplants in sweden have been transferred into them in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it 's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child , the ap reports . " we have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready , " says dr. mats brannstrom , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of goteburg . " he would not say whether any of these women were pregnant at the moment . " the women had to have the uterus removed because of complications . brannstrom 's technique , which would be a world first for the women to succeed in giving them the first transplants . the women were born in saudi arabia and turkey but no recipients have yet managed to have a child . " a pregnancy was achieved in turkey , but it failed after two months , " brannstrom says . the swedish doctor , who is leading the research team , says it 's " very sad " that three or two more will perhaps be able to get pregnant and miscarry . the team says it plans to use the embryo to make embryos easier for them , and the ap notes that the women will have to undergo the procedure .
