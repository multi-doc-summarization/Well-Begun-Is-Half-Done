the hubble space telescope has seen a never-before-seen set of six comet-like tails of the asteroid belt with nasa 's hubble telescope , reports the san jose mercury news . the asteroid , known as p/2013 p5 p5 , was discovered by the pan-starrs 1 telescope in hawaii on sept. 23 . the asteroid resembles a rotating lawn sprinkler system , but astronomers say it 's possible the asteroid 's rotation rate increased to the point where its surface started flying apart . " we were literally dumbfounded when we saw it , " says lead investigator david jewitt . " even more amazingly , its tail change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out . " p/2013 , who has been ejecting dust for at least five months , tells the new york times that it 's " hard to believe we 're looking at an asteroid , " but it 's not clear if the tails are the result of a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once . " we have n't seen anything like this before , " he says , adding that the hubble telescope is " a weird multi-tailed object . "
