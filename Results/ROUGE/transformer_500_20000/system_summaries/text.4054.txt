george zimmerman shot trayvon martin 's nose just over two weeks after the shooting of trayvon martin was " ultimately avoidable , " according to police documents released by the florida state attorney today . the new information is part of a wealth of information released that is related to the case , including the medical examiner 's finding that zimmerman was found in martin 's blood , tests show firefighters find " bleeding " from zimmerman and nose , cnn reports . " he immediately broke down in tears because he knew it was his son calling for help , " lawyer ben crump said in a march interview . " this disclosure came out thursday , part of <unk> request , " he said , adding that the disclosure of the 911 calls made to the state 's attorney general have been " cleaned , " cnn reports . the police perspective was most likely to be a police force overseen by zimmerman 's father , who is charged with second degree murder in the shooting death of martin , who was pronounced dead 3 minutes after his death . police say zimmerman had a bloody face and nose in his hand , and the firefighters who responded to a second tape that included a graphic of his voice . zimmerman , who has said he has no plans to take custody of his father , says he has n't spoken to any of his lawyers .
