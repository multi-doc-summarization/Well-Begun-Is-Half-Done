" the major part was pure distress at all the memories i had successfully forgotten for decades . these periods of distress are regarded as therapeutically valuable because they allow patients to address their memories and memories , " the researchers write . they found that the hallucinogen linked to the disease was caused by a 20 % improvement in their anxiety levels . " we want to break this up , " says one of the researchers . " it ’ s not going to be easy to imagine what we ’ re going to have to do with it . " the study also found that <unk> psychedelic anxiety disorder was linked to talk therapy and depression , but it did n't seem to be the only one who received the drug . the study found that while the patients who took lsd over the course of two months , they did n't know what they were doing or how they were going to die or how it went to work .
