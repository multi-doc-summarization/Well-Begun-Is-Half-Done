lawyers for a west suburban chicago man accused of plotting to set off a bomb outside a chicago bar say they 're hiding information to avoid a constitutional challenge . adel daoud , a former national security agency contractor who leaked details to news organizations about the investigation , says he is asking only for a yes or no on whether evidence in his case was derived from the expanded law , reports the chicago tribune . prosecutors say they have no obligation to disclose the information unless ordered by the presiding over daoud 's case , but the government is refusing to say whether it was used to develop evidence to charge adel daoud . " whenever it sparked an amendment to the foreign intelligence surveillance act is important , " daoud tells the tribune . " and these cases show the program has worked. . " daoud , who has been on administrative leave since 2008 , was arrested last year after allegedly trying to bomb a downtown chicago bar , where he thought he 'd done it . the government says the surveillance programs were exposed to " a massive government surveillance program that has once again become the focus of national debate over its reach into americans ' private communications program , " per the chicago sun-times . the feds say snowden , who was arrested on friday , faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted .
