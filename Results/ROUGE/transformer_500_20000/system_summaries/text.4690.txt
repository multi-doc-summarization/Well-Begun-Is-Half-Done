the university of texas at austin will move the statue honoring jefferson davis to the dolph center for american history , reports the austin american-statesman . james stephen hogg , albert johnston , and john reagan had deep ties to texas , but the university says the statue will be moved to another exterior location on campus . " while every historical figure leaves a mixed legacy , i believe jefferson davis is in a separate category , " fenves wrote in a letter to the ut community . " and that it is not in the university 's best interest to continue commemorating him . " davis , who will be buried in the main mall in austin , is expected to have a new home in austin . he plans to consider striving for a restoration of the civil rights movement , which he calls " one of the most important aspects of our nation 's and university 's history . " the statue of jefferson davis , a confederate generals robert e. lee and sidney johnston , will remain in place until the end of next year . the statue is seen as a tacit admission of guilt over racial discrimination against the confederate government , which has been criticized by critics of the confederate pows for their support of the confederacy . the statues are believed to be in the shadows as well as a re-creation of the 19th-century confederate south mall in the 19th century , and they 're expected to fetch between $ 200,000 and $ 280 million .
