scientists have found a way to reverse down syndrome in people with down syndrome , which causes the brain to grow normally , the washington post reports . the study in science translational medicine offers no direct link to a treatment for humans . researchers at johns hopkins university used lab mice to have extra copies of about half the genes found on human chromosome in mice with a down syndrome-like condition on the day of birth , according to a press release . the compound causes intellectual disabilities , distinctive features , and other health problems . the researchers say it may someday offer a path toward future breakthroughs . " it â€™ s a huge surprise , " one researcher says . " it 's very exciting . " researchers say the compound is caused by down syndrome-like conditions in mice that are n't genetically engineered , but it 's not clear whether it 's the result of down syndrome or any other form of cancer . researchers say that while the compound 's learning and memory function is n't known as the " reversal of the syndrome , " there is no cure for down syndrome . " we hope that the cerebellum is about 60 % of the normal size , " researcher roger reeves says . " we have a lot of research on the compound and it 's going to be very difficult . " ( in other fascinating news , a study found that mice who have down syndrome are more likely to die prematurely than they are . )
