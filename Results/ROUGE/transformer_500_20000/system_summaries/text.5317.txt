a chinese man who sued local government officials over an attack by a wild panda has won more than $ 80,000 in compensation , his lawyer tells afp . guan quanzhi , a farmer in li baizi village , was working on his farmland on march 1 when he had eight surgeries in the past year . the panda escaped from the other villagers , but the panda got hold of his leg and only released its grip on the panda . " i saw a panda jump out in front of me , its body completely covered in mud , " he says . the panda 's natural habitat mostly lies in southwestern china , but it has a notoriously low reproductive rate and are under pressure from factors such as habitat loss . " the number of wild pandas rose nearly 17 % over the decade to reach 1,864 , " says his lawyer . " it 's not clear if it 's going to happen to them . " the panda , meanwhile , is now home to more than 100 wild pandas . " we 're not going to be able to get them to the hospital , but we do n't know what they 're going to do , " one resident tells the kennebec journal .
