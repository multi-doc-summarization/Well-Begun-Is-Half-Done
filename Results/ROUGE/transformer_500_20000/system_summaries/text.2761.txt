" this was so extraordinary that at first i questioned the result : was this real or was it due to a data error , " says son nghiem of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena . " it 's fair to say that this is unprecedented in the history of climate change , " he says . " we are not aware of the data . " the iceberg , meanwhile , melted at a faster rate this month than at any other time , but it was captured by three satellites in the indian space research laboratory last year , notes the los angeles times , which notes that the iceberg is n't the only one experiencing it . " i think we 're going to be able to make it a mistake , " the nasa scientist says .
