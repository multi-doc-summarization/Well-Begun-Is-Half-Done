anita krajnc has been charged with giving water to thirsty pigs outside a slaughterhouse in toronto , and she 's not an " unknown substance , " the toronto star reports . the 49-year-old founder of toronto pig save , who gave water to pigs in 2015 , says she poured water into the openings of a tractor-trailer carrying pigs in burlington , canada , on june 22 , 2015 . she says she did n't intend to hurt the pigs or mean to reject them . " if they were dogs , i would be a hero , " she says , per the cbc . krajnc , who has been fined and sent to jail for six months in prison , says the judge " rejected the assertion by animal rights activists . " the cbc reports that the judge has dismissed the case as a way to dismiss krajnc 's actions . " i 'm on trial for giving water , " harris says . " it 's demeaning to women and women of all ages . " the judge , however , says it 's not clear whether the case will be resolved . the cbc notes krajnc 's lawyer , david harris , says krajnc is n't convinced the pigs were slaughtered in the slaughterhouse , but the guardian notes that the case is " eerily similar to the fact that it 's a very complicated case . " ( a man in canada is accused of using a water bottle into a metal trailer . )
