president obama delivered an plea to the african-american community saturday night to help stop donald trump from winning hillary clinton . " if i hear anybody saying their vote does not matter , that it does n't matter who we elect -- read up on your history . it matters . we 've got to get people to vote , " he said . " i will consider it a personal insult to my legacy . if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election . you want to give me a good ? go vote . " the speech was part shock-to-the-system wake-up call , and the washington post sees it as a " nasty , hateful charlatan selling a false message to african-americans and the rest of the country that puts everything president obama has done in office and stood for at risk . " " my name may not be on the ballot in november , all of the progress that the country has made over the last eight years was on the line , " obama told the crowd , adding that he 's " pretty much on the <unk> ballot . "
