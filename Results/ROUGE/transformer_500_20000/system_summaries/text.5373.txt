john mccain tweeted his pride at winning a diplomatic visit with syrian rebels last year . " it is a sad but unsurprising truth that the assad regime is less concerned with its massacre of more than 200,000 men , women and children than it is my visit with those brave syrians fighting for their freedom and dignity , " he wrote in a letter to the united nations . " we have done virtually nothing to bring down this terrible regime despite its atrocities is a stain on our collective moral responsibility . " the syrian government , which has been feuding with the israeli secret service , says it has been working on a plan to take “ the necessary measures against their nationals who enter syrian territory illegally , ” the new york times reports . the us embassy in washington , dc , says the visit is a sign that mccain was n't invited to the un because he feared the us would be allowed to stay in the hands of the rebels . the senator , whose name has not been released in the wake of mccain 's death in 2014 , says he was " shocked and dismayed " by mccain 's comments . " i think it ’ s the responsibility of the syrian people who perpetrated the war against the people of iraq and greater syria , " mccain told the washington post .
