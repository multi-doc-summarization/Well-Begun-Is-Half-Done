a new study has found that alzheimer 's disease has a dormant microbial component . researchers at oxford university say they 've found a correlation between the disease and two types of bacteria that are major causes of alzheimer 's , reports the washington post . the study , published in the journal of urgent disease , calls it " the most regarded cause of dementia in the world , " but it 's not clear whether it 's related to the disease . " we can ’ t keep ignoring all of the evidence , " says douglas kell , a professor of infectious diseases . " there is incontrovertible evidence that alzheimer ’ s is a dormant component , " he says . the study found that microbes from the brains of microbes have been diagnosed with the disease , though the study did n't provide any evidence to the contrary . researchers say the proteins , metabolism , chlamydia , and other substances are named as the " major culprits , " though they are n't clear yet whether they will be able to find a cure for alzheimer 's . " we are not going to be aware of this , but we are working with clinicians , " the study 's authors write . the study is based on a number of studies , including one of the authors of the study . the post notes that the study has n't been peer-reviewed , but the researchers say it could be a " major step " for the study to determine whether the disease causes cold sores . " it ’ s an important issue , " one researcher says . " it 's a very dangerous situation . "
