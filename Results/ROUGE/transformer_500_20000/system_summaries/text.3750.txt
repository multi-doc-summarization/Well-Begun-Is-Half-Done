" twenty years ago , this would have been heretical ; finding evidence of life 3.8 billion years old was shocking , " researcher mark harrison says in a press release . the study is based on a number of factors , including carbon dioxide , methane , and chemical analysis , and dopamine levels . the upshot is that it 's not contamination from the earth 's atmosphere , but it 's " anyone 's guess exactly when life first appeared .
