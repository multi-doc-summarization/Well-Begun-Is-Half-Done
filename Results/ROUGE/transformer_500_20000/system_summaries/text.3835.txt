" i love you , " he tells the new york daily news . he says he was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist . instead , he was able to check his bank-account balance : $ 10 a spin . " maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him . it didn ’ t . he spent the next four hours burning through $ 13,000 from the account , and he had only $ 4,000 left . so he spent $ 13,000 on the account for the <unk> game that cost $ 10 , which he says is a " three-reel game . " stevens , who has been living in the casino since his death , tells the daily news that the casino is n't interested in saving their jobs . " it ’ s going to be a lot easier for me than it would have been , and i ’ m not sure if i ’ d be going to get to the casino , but i don ’ t think that ’ s a good idea , " says the manager of the casino where stevens resides . " i think he ’ s the guy who ’ s been living with me . "
