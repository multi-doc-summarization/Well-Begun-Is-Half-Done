scientists have discovered a spider that is partial to caves and debris in coastal forests from california to british columbia , reports discovery news . the spider was found in the debris of old-growth redwoods in northwest california , and it 's not clear how it eats mates , but scientists say it 's a fierce , specialized predator . " if such a large and bizarre spider could have gone undetected for thousands of years , it would be the last historic find , " says a researcher at the california academy of sciences . " but it 's very exciting . " the study , published in zookeys , calls the discovery " heretofore unknown . " the researchers say they 've found a number of ancient species of plants and animals , including the coastal red tailed frog and the mountain beaver . the claws are n't originating at the western cave conservancy , which is roughly the size of a half-dollar coin when its legs appear to be extended , reports livescience . the team says it 's " very surprised " to find the spider , but " it has been very consistent with the gravity of the world . " ( a study has found a correlation between bigfoot and animals . )
