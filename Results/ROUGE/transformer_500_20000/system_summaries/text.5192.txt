rand paul has asked kentucky 's senate to file a bill that would allow him to run for re-election in congress as well as president of the united states . " yes , i am working on an ambiguous state law that rand paul believes is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to bar running for re-election to the senate and for president at the same time , " kentucky senate majority leader damon thayer tells the washington post . " [ he ] explained much like i just did the situation in that he is running for the u.s. senate in 2016 , but that 's strongly considering seeking the republican nomination . " paul , who testified in support of restoring voting rights , says he plans to clarify a law that prohibits candidates from holding or running for two offices in the same year . " he did â€¦ bring it up to the entire caucus , " he says , per the new york times . the bill , which is expected to pass by paul , is expected next week , and paul is considering charging him with a bill to run the gop presidential nomination .
