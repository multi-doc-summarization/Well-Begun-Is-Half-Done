amy adams pulled a first-class move on friday when she gave up her seating to an american serviceman who was also on her delta flight from detroit to los angeles . " once we boarded , i saw she was in first class and she was a couple rows behind me . i think she must have said something to the flight attendant , because before we took off she had vacated her seat , " she wrote in a message from the flight , per nbc news . " when we were waiting to board , i was upgraded to first class . i was a fan of hers , but now i 'm an even bigger fan now . " adams , 39 , took his seat in the coach 's seat and brought the soldier to her seat . " i just thought it was incredibly classy and thoughtful , " hill says , adding that she was " a fan " who was traveling with her . " i think it must have been the best way to make this happen . " hill , who has a history of cheekily posting a photo of herself with the caption , " numbers never lie . "
