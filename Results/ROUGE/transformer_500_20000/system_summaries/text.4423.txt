the ancient cousins of humans were capable of more complex behavior than previously thought , scientists say . the structures were made from hundreds of pillar-shaped mineral deposits , called stalagmites , which were chopped to a similar length and laid out in two oval patterns up to 40 centimeters ( 16 inches high . they were discovered by chance in 1990 after remaining untouched for tens of thousands of years because a rockslide had closed the mouth of the cave at bruniquel in southwest france , france , reports the ap . " making these edifices among the oldest known well-dated made by humans , " says archaeologist jacques jaubert of the university of bordeaux . " it â€™ s a very difficult journey to recover from the cave , so what else were the rings and mounds for homo sapiens ? " he says . " it 's a huge shock , but it 's not going to happen . " the ap notes that the rings were older than any other cave painting ever found . " the cave was 47,600 years old , " rouzaud says . " it was a very brazen discovery . " the discovery of modern humans in europe around 45,000 years ago , when neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for the painting . the ap reports that the discovery is likely to have been the first early humans in the south of france .
