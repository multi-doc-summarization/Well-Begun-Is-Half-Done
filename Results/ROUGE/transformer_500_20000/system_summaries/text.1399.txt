earthquakes in the state of oklahoma have caused a sharp rise in the rate of oil and gas extraction , according to a study published in science . researchers found that the disposal of water in four wells could be responsible for a swarm of wastewater injections , reports the bbc , which notes that the increase in quakes is likely to be caused by a 5.7 tremor . " most big sequences of earthquakes that we see are either a main shock and a lot of aftershocks or it might be right at these locations in our model is enough to push them over the edge dr katie keranen , " says cornell university in a press release . " it really is unprecedented to have this many earthquakes over a broad region like this . " researchers say they 've found evidence of links between the wastewater and gas industry , including the possibility that the quakes are occurring at the middle of a volcano in a volcanic system or geothermal system . the study also found that oklahoma 's oil and fracking processes is injected into rocks to avoid polluting freshwaterâ€”could be driving the sharp increase in the oil industry .
