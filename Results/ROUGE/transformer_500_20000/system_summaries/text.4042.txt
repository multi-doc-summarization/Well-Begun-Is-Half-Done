the supreme court 's refusal to hear every case means that gay marriages can begin immediately in indiana , oklahoma , and wisconsin , the ap reports . the court 's ruling is based on seven separate cases challenging state laws barring legal recognition of same-sex marriage , and it 's not clear whether the federal constitution bars from refusing to recognize same-sex marriages under state law . the ruling is unexpected and somewhat bizarre , writes ruth bader ginsburg at the wall street journal . it 's a sentiment echoed by sonia sotomayor , who wonders whether the court will take one or more of the cases . " if any , of course , that the court refused to hear those cases altogether , " she writes . " it simply means that the justices haven â€™ t decided which . " the court also tilts to the right , and if they do so , they would be split on the issue . but the court did n't dismiss the ruling , and the justices did say they were n't satisfied with the ruling . the justices also criticized the decision , arguing that the ruling was based on a " lack of evidence " that gay marriage bans " unconstitutional . " the justices have been feuding over the past two decades , but the new york times points out that ruth bader , antonin scalia , scalia , and samuel alito , disagreed on the case . the ap notes that in the case of doma , the court would take a circuit court to rule against gay marriage , but it 's unlikely the justices will be able to reconcile the case .
