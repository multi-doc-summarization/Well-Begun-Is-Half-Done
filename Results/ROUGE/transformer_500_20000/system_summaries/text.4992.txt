steve scalise 's office acknowledged that he was making lots of speeches during that time period as he built his political career and it was " likely " he 'd spoke to the white supremacist group . " i did n't know who all of these groups were and i detest any kind of hate group , " he said in a statement , per politico . " for anyone to suggest that i was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous . " scalise , who has been a ku klux klan member since the 2002 event , has been calling members to gauge the level of support he had from his party , the hill reports . the house majority whip , steve scalise , and bayou state republicans backed scalise at least for now , the washington post reports . the house is standing by steve scalise as a state representative , and scalise will not confirm that he spoke of the group 's views on the matter . the post notes that scalise has his " full confidence " as whip , and the post points out that the group has been thrown into doubt by the house .
