at least 66,405 , or 11 % of the deficient bridges in the usa are structurally deficient , according to a new report from transportation for america , the washington post reports . the <unk> bridge on the major bridge in mount vernon , wash. , collapsed when it was struck by a truck with an oversize load struck the upper part of the interstate 5 crossing the skagit river in washington state . it 's not clear they are unsafe or in danger of collapse , but transportation advocates say it 's " structurally , " meaning key elements are in poor condition . " these are not rarely used , out-of-the structures : each day , americans take 260 million trips over the course of holiday travel , " says an expert . the federal highway administration hastens to note that the collapse of a span of four bridges will be 65 years old , and that the federal government has deemed structurally deficient . the study also found that 260 million 10- or 11-year-old cars were affected by the collapse , and the number of bridges suffered only minor injuries . " we 've never had a better bridge system " more than a month after the may 23 incident . the study , published in the journal plos one , calls it a " growing crisis of aging infrastructure . " it 's also the first time millions will be taken on deficient bridges , which would require a more thorough review of the label . ( in 2016 , a man was fined $ 76 billion over a tractor-trailer . )
