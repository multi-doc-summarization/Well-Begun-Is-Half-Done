the us transportation security administration will still prohibit some knives , including those with locking blades , as well as golf clubs and pool cues . the policy change , which will take effect april 25 , was immediately criticized by flight attendants , who say the move will create an unnecessary risk and further crowd the already limited space in the overhead bins , the los angeles times reports . " while we agree that a passenger wielding a small knife or swinging a golf club or hockey stick poses less of a threat to the pilot locked in the cockpit , these are real threats to passengers and flight attendants in the passenger cabin , " said john pistole , president of the transportation workers union . the change will remove items small with less blades shorter than sporting equipment , including golf clubs , ski poles , and hockey , as many as two inch , pistole said , " this policy was designed to make the lives of tsa staff easier , but not make flights safer . " the tsa says it will remove knives from the tsa list of items that are currently prohibited , the ap reports .
