the oil slick off the coast of louisiana has been unable to stop crude oil from streaming out of a broken pipe attached to a well 5,000 feet below sea level . the leaks were found days after an oil rig to which the pipe was exploded and sank in the gulf about 50 miles southeast of venice , reports the ap . " if some of the weather conditions continue , the delta area is at risk , " says a scientific coordinator for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . " we fully understand there are benefits and trade-offs , " he says , adding that with a final decision not to burn the oil , it could become one of worst spills in us history . the coast guard says it has n't made yet about whether the oil would arrive in the next three days , but it 's not clear where along the gulf coast . the oil is still leaking at a rate of about 42,000 gallons a day from the well , and officials say they 're considering setting the gulf of mexico oil slick on fire as it moved to within 20 miles of sensitive ecological areas .
