the tomb of jesus christ is the size of a coat closet , and it 's not exactly clear whether it 's a burial place , but a new study suggests it may have been nudged along by a long period of time . researchers at the national technical university of athens say they 've found the remains of a limestone cave in 30 or 33 years , reports the jerusalem post . the tomb , which has been dated for about 60 hours , was found in jerusalem 's church of the holy sepulchre , but it was n't until late last year . the researchers say they found the tomb complex near the crusader period , and the discovery of the 326 christians in the tomb suggests that jesus nazareth , whose tomb was destroyed by the romans , has long been ruled inadmissible . " we are very excited about it , " says the lead researcher . " we have no idea what it 's going to happen . " the discovery is n't clear , however , but the study is expected to be closer to the tomb . " it 's very important to think that there is a lot of things that are going to be done , " one researcher says .
