the islamic state has liberated the city of mosul , the single largest , most complex humanitarian operation in the world . " everyone is staying at home because we don â€™ t know what else to do . daesh has placed a large depot of ieds [ devices ] in a house next to my cousin 's house . i begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me as the sunni , " says lise grande , a 35-year-old from the east side of the city , per the guardian . the planes started bombing around 1am today and they are in the sky constantly and occasionally striking targets , says mohammed . " daesh are moving into civilian houses and have small and heavy guns , " he says . he says the airstrikes were mostly targeted by isis , but it 's not clear whether it was a chemical weapons attack . " we also fear that isil , as they did in fallujah , may try and hold civilian populations accountable for their actions , " grande says , adding that the group is " mostly moving around on on motorbike and mixing with the population .
