pope francis ' fascination with the devil took a toll on the sunday mass in st. peter 's square , with the italian bishops accusing him of " having altered the truth " and " liberate " a mexican man possessed by four demons , the bbc reports . " the pope had either performed an exorcism or a prayer to free the man from the devil . its director later said he " did not intend to perform any exorcism . " the bbc notes that the footage shows a young man holding his hands on his head and recited a half-dozen times , shook , then slumped in his wheelchair . the images , which included images of the exorcist , were shown on a tv channel owned by the devil . the pope , who brought him to rome from mexico to attend francis ' mass on sunday , says the pictures are " no doubt " that the man who opened his mouth as he always does with the sick or suffering who come his way , he simply intended to pray for a suffering person . the pope 's response , per the bbc , is a little more definitive .
