john boehner and ezra klein are looking for work . " i am honored and humbled to represent a great , hard-working community in congress . the people of ohio 's eighth congressional district continue to afford me the privilege to serve , for which i am deeply grateful . we gather here today at a time of great challenges . nearly one in ten of our neighbors are <unk> , and our debt will soon eclipse the size of our entire economy . hard work and tough decisions will be required of the 112th congress . no longer can we kick the can down the road . the people voted to end business as usual , and today we begin carrying out their instructions . " boehner promised almost nothing at all . " he certainly did n't set himself up as a foil to president obama . " boehner 's speech had two themes : humility , and comity , " he said , per the washington post . " it 's still just me , " said boehner , who has been on the campaign trail for a while . " i think it 's going to be the first to stop applauding the new speaker . "
