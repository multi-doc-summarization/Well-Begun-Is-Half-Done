ken cuccinelli has sent one of the strangest tweets in response to the death of osama bin laden . " how much would i give to be one of my 72 virginans osama is 'hanging out ' with since sunday ? " he writes in the washington post . " i told you there would be 72 virginians waiting for you . what did you think i said ? " the attorney general was referring to bin laden 's death in roanoke , james monroe , and patrick henry , among others , who have the same love for liberty and america . cuccinelli , for his part , is " a virgin , or was he perhaps more disturbingly shooting for " virginians . " cuccinelli , meanwhile , says he 's " trying to say that he wishes he had sexually , in the great beyond ? maybe he plans to give the dead terrorist the " blue balls ? " " he drops a large weight on osama 's knee , " and " this is why i allowed the federal government to provide for the common defense ! " he says , adding that " it 's not what i was promised ! "
