talia jane , a customer at california state university , was fired two hours after she posted an article to medium entitled " an open letter to my ceo . " the letter , which has since gone viral , has been deleted , but it 's not clear what caused talia 's death . " the crux of the open letter was what ms. jane considered her inferior level of compensation when compared to her bay area living expenses , be it rent , electricity , internet , and so on , " talia wrote in a letter to ceo jeremy stoppelman . " but my work email address does n't exist , which means i have officially been fired from yelp/eat24 for writing this . " talia 's response : " i am deeply sorry to share the experience of having a car and a credit card and my own apartment , and i am not going to be able to do it again , " she writes , adding that she 's not sure why she was a kid in the 90s , but she 's 25 years old . " i think she 's going to make a mistake , but i 'm not sure what it means to be an adult . now , seventeen years later , talia 's parents have enrolled in the yelp review of the yelp page and posted a medium post on social media . the post also points out that jane 's customer service agents are now enrolled at the company in yelp reviews of the company 's " outdated advertising campaign " in the wake of the spice girls and owning a pager were # goals . " we 're going to have a lot of fun
