hundreds of dolphins have been found dying off the coast of virginia , where they 're being tested for measles , coyotes , and seals , the new york times reports . according to noaa , the virus has been found in some beached dolphins in shallow water in new york and north carolina , but it 's not clear how many dolphins have died offshore without reaching mid-atlantic beaches . " we do n't have a lot of insight as to when it will stop . we are now calling it a morbillivirus outbreak , " noaa fisheries tells the times . the virus is believed to be the second big strike for the dolphin die-off , which killed more than 700 animals before retreating into the blue in 1988 , reports the times , which notes that the dolphin carcasses are extremely rare for humans to be transmitted by humans . " it 's very sad that we have to deal with it , " says a marine mammal expert who predicts the die-off will happen in the next few weeks . " if you 're going to get sick , you 're not going to die .
