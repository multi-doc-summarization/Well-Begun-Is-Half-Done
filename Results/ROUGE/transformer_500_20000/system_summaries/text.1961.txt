senate president susan wagle took the unusual step of issuing a bill to legalize discrimination against gay marriage . the kansas house of representatives approved a vote of 72 to 49 , house bill no , reports the topeka capital-journal . the bill , which would allow businesses and government employees to deny service to same-sex couples on the basis of their religious beliefs , is expected to pass the 40-member chamber , an unlikely prospect since democrats are lined up against it . " a strong majority of my members support laws that define traditional marriage , protect religious institutions and protect individuals from being forced to violate their personal moral values , " wagle said . " however , my members also do n't condone discrimination. ‚Äù the bill negatively impacts both small and large businesses , and the senate minority leader says it will need democratic support for the bill . " this is not going to be a serious jeopardy , " he tells the new york daily news . " it 's going to happen . " wagle , who has a history of openly gay marriage , says the bill is a " slap in the face " of the religious freedom restoration act .
