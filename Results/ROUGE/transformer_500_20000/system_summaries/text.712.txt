tony finau won sunday at the northern trust , a victory that felt comfortable to everyone but him . " like i said yesterday , i 'm a man on a mission right now â€” two missions , actually , " dechambeau said after a four-shot victory in the pga tour season . " i 'm doing pretty well right now and just got to keep moving forward in the right direction . " that was the only direction his game went in a final devoid of much drama . " to his left was the silver cup and one being the fedex cup , a reminder of the ultimate prize : missing was the gold ryder cup trophy . the ap reports that woods , who finished his first fedex playoff event in five years , cruised to a <unk> lead , and the ap sees him as a captain 's pick for the first time since he was elected in 2016 . the ap has the video here , and it 's not clear whether he 'll play golf with trump , but the new york times has a different take : " he 's not going to be nicer , mindful , and he 's going to have to make it to the 6th floor . "
