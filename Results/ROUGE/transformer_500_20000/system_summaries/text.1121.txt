harry reid 's plan to reform the filibuster rules is supposed to narrowly focus on presidential nominees to the executive branch of the filibuster , but the senate is balking at it , reports the new york times . the move avoids a procedural hurdle : the senate would lose a crucial check on the execution of laws they find distasteful , but it would require the senate to pass changes to them . " what they ’ re threatening to do is kill the senate , " mcconnell said , per politico . the filibuster has been changed over the years , and senators have never successfully made good on their threat to change . " we need to understand your grievances more , " harkin said in a letter to the washington post . " it ’ s a very sad day for the democrats to reject the law . " reid , meanwhile , says he 's " not even going to kill the filibuster " because it 's " a nuclear option , " and that he 's willing to do it . " i do n't think it 's going to be an issue , " he tells the times .
