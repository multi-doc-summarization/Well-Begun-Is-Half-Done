the influential conservative website redstate fired a handful of prominent writers on friday in a move that appeared to be the " mass firing , " the daily beast reports . " very sad to see , but finally , after all these years , they 've turned off my account , " says one of the sources who spoke with cnnmoney . " multiple sources told that they believed conservative critics of president trump were the writers targeted for removal . " " insufficiently partisan " was the phrase one used in a redstate group chat . " they fired everybody who was insufficiently supportive of trump , " he wrote . " and , finally , , after these years . " the site 's owner , erick erickson , says the site has " reached the conclusion that we can no longer support the entire current roster of candidates . " redstate 's editor-in-chief susan <unk> , who left the site after approving a memo from townhall general manager and vice president jonathan garthwaite , says that while it is n't clear whether the cuts will be made , " it was about politics , " and that the site is " having to make changes to redstate effective today .
