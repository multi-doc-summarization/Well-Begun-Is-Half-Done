president obama and german chancellor angela merkel will travel to the united states at the end of next week , reports the washington post . the move comes after a barrage of criticism from both sides of the aisle over the spying of european union ambassadors who met in brussels on thursday . " i want to allay my concerns , " obama said , according to the new york times . " it â€™ s not going to be a good day for us . " the european union has been ratcheting up sanctions against the us and european countries for spying on the us . " we are going to make a lot of money for our countries and our allies , " said a spokesman for vladimir putin . the meeting comes amid a wave of criticism over the us spying on european countries , including iran , iran , libya , and saudi arabia . the us is also in limbo in a transit area where the us spied on european allies . the wall street journal has a similar take on snowden 's ties to edward snowden : the us has n't responded to requests for comment .
