john hawkins is back in the running for president , and he 's got a lot of attention . in a new interview with fox news , ayers reveals that he 's the one who 's bound to detect a deeper truth in his tone . " when she countered that she thought he had at least edited it , he egged her on by insisting that no , he had written the darned thing . i think he enjoys mocking people who push this idea and enjoys it doubly when they can ’ t detect the mockery . in fact , i ’ d bet that this is his stock response anytime the book is mentioned in his presence , " writes chris cillizza at the washington post . ayers , who has been feuding with the blogger if she could prove it . but he 's not a fan of ayers , either . he 's a formidable debater on the field , but he does n't seem to have much to say about ayers 's <unk> . he 's also got some good news for ayers : " he ’ s a guy in the white house , but it ’ s not like he ’ d be happy to split the royalties with the rest of his career .
