china on sunday began a suspension of all coal imports from north korea , starting sunday and for the rest of 2017 . china 's ministry of commerce , in a public notice jointly issued with the country 's customs agency saturday , said the decision was made to comply with a un security council resolution that china helped draft and pass last november . " resolution imposed some of the toughest yet against the north korean regime , after disregarded an earlier un ban to test what it said was a nuclear warhead in september 2016 , but those restrictions allowed some imports for civilian use . china is north korea 's largest source of trade and aid and sunday 's suspension will deprive pyongyang of an important source of foreign currency , the ap reports . beijing has come under pressure from president trump to lean harder on pyongyang , but beijing says its influence is limited . however , it has grown increasingly frustrated with north korea â€™ s most recent missile test a week ago . " imports of coal produced in north korea -- including shipments already declared to the customs but yet to be released , will be suspended for the remainder of this year , " said the statement .
