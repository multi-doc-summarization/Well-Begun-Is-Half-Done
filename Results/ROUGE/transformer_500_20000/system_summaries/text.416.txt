vladimir putin is spending a reported $ 50 billion on the games including a purportedly impenetrable ring of steel , a distinction he says is a " catastrophic terrorist strike . " the carnegie endowment for international peace , which has claimed responsibility for the sochi winter olympics , will be held in the wake of two recent suicide bombings that killed 34 people in volgograd , 700 miles north of sochi , reports nbc news . it 's not clear how many of the athletes will be in the games , but the us government has sent a private security firm to sochi , where they 're expected to use two warships in the black sea and planes on standby in europe to evacuate . " this is their territory , their country , " says a former russia official . " they get to decide what kind of outside help they do , " he says . " it 's basically a nonstarter , " adds an nbc reporter . " we 're not going to be able to do things without russian cooperation , but we do n't know what to do with them . "
