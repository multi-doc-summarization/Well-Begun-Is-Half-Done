donald trump 's decision to introduce legislation to ban nfl players from kneeling during the national anthem is a tacit admission of guilt , the washington post reports . " i wish that some of these players that get on one knee to protest this country and all the sacrifices that make it great would get on both knees and thank god that they live in the united states of buffalo , " trump said in a speech friday . " we will not you love to see one of these nfl owners , when somebody disrespects our flag . " trump , who serves as a commentator for espn , said he was not a fan of the protests , but he did n't think he would do anything to make amends with the nfl . " we are not going to be intimidated , " he said . " it 's going to happen . " he added that the nfl is n't letting players want to stand in front of the flag . the president , who has been feuding with trump since his remarks in charlottesville , has been criticized by both sides of the nfl and colin kaepernick for protesting racial injustice on the playing field . " we have a lot of people who have taken a knee during the anthem , but we do n't know what it is , and we do not know what to do , " the president said , adding that " we 're not talking about this .
