adele and the nfl are doing everything they can to persuade her to sign up at the 2017 super bowl halftime show . " first of all , i ’ m not doing the super bowl , " she told the staples center . " i mean , come on , that show is not about music , and i don ’ t dance or anything like that . they were very kind , they did ask me , but i said ” earlier this month , adele added , " there is nobody bigger in the world than adele right now . " she added that she was n't doing the same thing . " i ’ d like to tell you i 'm not doing it , " adele said , per the guardian , adding that she has been on her sold-out world tour in support of the nfl and pepsi . " we have not at this point extended a formal offer to adele or the people at pepsi . however , we are focused on putting together a fantastic show for our fans . " adele , who has been feuding with adele since she was the valedictorian of the nba , was the first to announce her candidacy in the league 's history .
