scientists have discovered that the larvae of the argentine horned ceratophrys in a pond nicknamed " adult frogs " have been found to use sound to communicate in a similar way , reports the bbc . researchers at south america 's national university of la plata in buenos aires say they were studying the mating calls and croakings of adult frogs when they encountered a horned frog tadpole with a net . they found tadpoles of the tadpoles of other frogs , and many of them were aggressive and carnivorous . " we heard a brief , clear and very audible metallic-like sound , " researcher guillermo natale tells the guardian . " it 's real . " the frog , which lives in argentina and uruguay , is the first evidence for the production of sound by the larvae to attack it . researchers say the frog can make sounds underwater , but it 's not clear if it 's the first time any vertebrate animal has been euthanized , though it 's unclear whether the larvae will be euthanized or if they do n't produce any sounds underwater . " it ’ s a very dangerous situation , " natale says . " if you don ’ t think about it , you ’ re going to be a <unk> flier . " ( a study in acta zoological of la found that tadpoles of one species let out an audible scream . )
