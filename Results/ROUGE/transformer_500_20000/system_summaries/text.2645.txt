facebook is blocking any link to tsu.co on every platform it owns , including messenger and instagram , the ap reports . the social network tallied up the ad revenue it earned against your update and passed a percentage back to you . " of course , facebook does nothing of the sort of <unk> its much smaller rival tsu.co does , " writes lily <unk> at cnet . " you can post pornhub links on facebook , but not tsu.co , " she writes . " it 's a business model that 's not all that different from youtube , which has been blocked from posting about 4.5 million facebook posts that ever mentioned tsu.co , making pictures , videos disappear in an attempt to kill off competition . " the ap notes that facebook is n't the only social media user who has been banned , but it 's not clear whether it will work , or whether facebook will do so . " if you do n't have a social network , you 're going to have to pay a lot of money , " says <unk> , who is winning a nobel in new york city .
