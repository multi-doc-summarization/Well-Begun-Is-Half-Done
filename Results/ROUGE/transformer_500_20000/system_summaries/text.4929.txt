" it 's been too long where our fans have n't had access to everything . this is our way of showing them how much we love them , " a member of the de la <unk> tells rolling stone . " we 've been blessed to be in the library of congress , but we ca n't even have our music on itunes . " the rapper says he has been working very hard to get that solved . he says it 's " been a trying journey , " and that he hopes to make amends with the rapper 's frequent use of a myriad of samples that have been prevented . " i 'm not a fan of it , " he says . " i think it 's going to be better than anyone else , and it 's just a matter of time . " he adds that he has n't sounded so warm , but he 's not sure he 'll be able to use the samples to get a hold of his own . " i 've never seen anything like this , and i almost feel guilty for putting nine songs after it . "
