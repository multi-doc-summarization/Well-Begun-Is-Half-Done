osama bin laden was shot dead by the lead helicopter , not from the ground , according to a new book by chuck pfarrer . the seals entered the building after being deposited on the roof of his three-story home in the way of the main house , not after an extended firefight , reports the washington post . " only minutes after bin was dead did the lead , heading for a landing spot , lose altitude and sink , tail-first , into the large walled east of the house , " pfarrer says in a statement about the raid . bin laden 's youngest wife , amal bin laden , was wounded in the calf while raising a blanket to block their view . pfarrer says he would have had enough warning to arm and effectively defend himself . " he was dead within 90 seconds of the raid . " pfarrer tells the post that the seal team landed and how one of their black hawk helicopters crashed , and the seals were able to climb stairs to reach bin laden . pfarrer says the men were scrambling for an aksu pistol when they arrived , and bin laden shoved his wife into the line of fire . he says the seals did n't have a kill order , but the men did so willingly .
