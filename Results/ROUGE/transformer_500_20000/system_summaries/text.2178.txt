john mccain says he 's leaning " no " on the proposal . " it is likely republicans wo n't be able to repeal and replace obamacare , and how many people will be helped or hurt by it . without a full cbo score , which wo n't happen by the end of the month , we wo n't have reliable answers to any of those questions . " the poll found that 24 % of voters approve of the bill , while 50 % disapprove of it . " i believe we could do better working together , republicans and democrats , and have not yet really tried . nor could i support it without knowing how much it will cost , " mccain said in a statement . the bill would convert obamacare 's insurer and medicaid funds into block grants , the washington post reports . " i can not in good conscience vote for the graham-cassidy proposal . " the post notes that the senate is expected to pass a procedural vote on the bill next week . the gop is already considering delaying the vote . the bill is also unpopular with republicans , who are opposed to the affordable care act .
