the duke of york is the first member of the british royal family to join twitter . prince andrew 's first tweet was " welcome to my twitter account - ay , " the bbc reports . " if the tweets are signed ay , they will have been written by prince andrew himself . the sign-off led one user to ask if his account had been hacked by ali g , sacha baron cohen 's comedy character , who used a similar catchphrase . " yo how 's jeffrey epstein ? " tweeted a post at mashable . the duke is a champion of free speech . for him it 's about telling people what he 's doing , " he wrote . " i do n't think it 's going to be a good idea to be effective . " two golf clubs and two official royal family accounts were @ britishmonarchy and mike epstein , who was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution . the bbc notes that the royal family has a history of mental illness and schizophrenia , and it 's not clear whether they 'll be able to post the video .
