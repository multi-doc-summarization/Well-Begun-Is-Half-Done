" she added that she " was n't the only one who did n't know what to do with the white house call .

" the tweet was quickly deleted , but it was quickly reposted by the daily dot , which has a full list of people who were offended by the hashtag # <unk> . " yes , boobs . he would say something like " he loves the first " amendment and " boobs . " travis also apologized for his " racist and very unusual sentiment " and said he would " vigorously defend himself . "
