a new study has found that birds and mammals start breeding , trigger the growth of horns and even change the thickness of their coat , the guardian reports . researchers at nottingham and bristol universities say they 've found that changes during the year in sex hormones made in the pituitary gland in the brain , which produces melatonin . the study , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , found that melatonin made in pineal gland control when mammals start reproducing , and other changes like growing new coats or developing antlers . " the length of the day is recognised in most vertebrate animals by the hormone melatonin , " researcher david bates tells the guardian . " we know what that link is we can start to understand how it can be controlled . " the researchers say the monkey attempts to link the change in seasons to their fertility . " it 's very exciting to see if you 're horny in the winter , but you 're not going to be able to make it to the reproduction of the aging process , " he says . " it is a very complicated process , and it 's not necessarily a good idea for you to get it . " the study 's lead author tells the new york times that melatonin may be the result of the release of hormones from the gland that control multiple functions as well as the <unk> gland , which is released from the pineal gland . the researchers hope to find a way to control seasonal fertility treatments for deer , which are already in the process of year , to help farmers adversely affect the future .
