instagram is n't the only one making changes to instagram 's privacy policy . the company 's co-founder , kevin systrom , tells the san francisco chronicle that " rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed , " adding that " we are going to take the time to complete our plans , and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work . " he says the company would revert to its previous terms of service , which have been in effect since october 2010 , when it was revealed that users would n't be used in advertisements without compensation and even without their knowledge . " i am sorry for that , and i am focused on making it right . the concerns we heard about from you the most focused on advertising , and what our changes might mean for you to display your user name , likeness , and photos . " in a blog post earlier this week , instagram said it " has no intention of selling your photos , and we have to be really clear . "
