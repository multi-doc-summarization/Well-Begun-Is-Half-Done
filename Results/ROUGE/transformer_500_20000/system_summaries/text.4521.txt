" that is what makes the country great , you know ? different , " he said . " selfish action is better than inaction . " three lawmakers , all republican , voted against the measure , but the idaho statesman reports that the prayer is n't the only one who voted against it . " i think it 's unfair to anyone who wants to walk out of the senate , " one democratic lawmaker said . " i do n't think i 'm going to do it . " the ap notes that in the meantime , the prayer has been viewed more than 100 times since the opening of the chamber . " we are very inclusive in hinduism , and we are going to make a lot of money , " says zed . " it 's a very dangerous situation . " he says he has n't been boycotting the prayer because it was " a horrible mistake , " but he says it was a mistake . " it was good . " the idaho state 's president , bill haslam , says he plans to walk the prayer in the middle of the day .
