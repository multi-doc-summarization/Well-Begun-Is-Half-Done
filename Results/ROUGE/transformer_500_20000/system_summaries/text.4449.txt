marco rubio 's response to president obama 's state of the union response was swift : " that water bottle should n't have been so far for him to grab . too much awkwardness in one speech ! # sotu , " he wrote on twitter , per the hill . he added , " marco rubio , the man you want to have a desperate gulp of water with . " he added that he was n't aware of the problem , but he did n't hear a single one of them . the washington post points out that rubio 's speech was n't the first time he was in office , and the post notes that it 's not clear whether he was a fan of president obama , but the post reports that the speech was the result of a " flurry of tweets " from the senator himself , who helped elect president bill cllinton . the post has a screenshot of the speech here , and it has a photo of rubio holding a bottle of water near the end of his state of poland . the post points to rubio 's comments on the post , which notes that rubio has been criticized for his " strong material but the trivial water bit will get endless attention . "
