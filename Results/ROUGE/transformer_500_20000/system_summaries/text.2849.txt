president obama 's plan to close the detention facility in guantanamo bay is likely to hinge on americans on the issue . the white house has changed little since 2009 , when it comes to americans ' support for closing the prison at guantanamo bay , reports the new york times . the move comes after a congressional ban on bringing detainees to the us prisons , and it 's not clear whether they 'll be able to support the prison 's closure by 2009 . the prison has fallen since 2007 , from 37 % in 2007 to 28 % by november 2009 . but the prison still has n't changed much in the four times , notes gallup , which points out that republicans have n't been able to oppose closing the facility since 2007 . " we 're not going to have it , but we 're going to get it done , " says a former pentagon official . " it 's a very difficult time . " republicans have already pounced on the move , saying they 're " divided on the wisdom of negotiating with terrorist groups to secure the release of americans . "
