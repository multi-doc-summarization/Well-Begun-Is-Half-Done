a new study has found that fast food is only a small portion of calories from fast food . researchers at the university of north carolina found that obese children learn at home are the most likely to become obese , reports the washington post . " eating fast foods is just one behavior that results from those bad habits , " says the lead researcher . " just because children who eat more fast food should probably make many of them overweight or obese anyway , " he says . the study , published in the american journal of clinical nutrition , found poor habits in children who were frequent eating at a fast-food restaurant , and the results of the study were n't conclusive . the researchers found that even when they are not eating food purchased at a restaurant , they were surprised to find that calories from a bottle , and heat up frozen pizzas , reports cbs news . the results were n't immediately clear , but the study did n't shed much light on the cause of the obesity epidemics , which caused a surge of deaths in the last 4,500 years . the study also found that the children who carry an unhealthful amount of weight were more likely to eat food that they eat , and they were n't eating at the restaurant . the researchers say they 've found a correlation between the consumption of fast food and diet and other health benefits , including sugar-sweetened soda and stuffed animal meat into the mix .
