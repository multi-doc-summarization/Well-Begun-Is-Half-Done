the union street guest house in hudson , ny , is charging guests with a $ 500 fine for each negative review of the site 's site , pix11 reports . the hotel , which has been rented out by the shops , has already been cleaned up for three rooms , including a <unk> ladder and a <unk> entrance to the hotel 's entrance . " it was worst hotel i have ever encountered , " says michael g of manhattan . " rude customer service , unclean , terrible odor . then they had the audacity to tell me they would charge me $ 500 from my deposit if i posted a negative review they heard of the freedom of speech ? " he says . " instead of taking responsibility and striving to improve customer service . " he adds that the hotel has been " <unk> " since it was supposed to be a " gallery of <unk> . " it 's not clear if the hotel will have to deal with it , but it will take awhile to figure out what 's going to happen if it does n't happen to anyone else in the area . " it â€™ s going to be very sad to see that it 's a shame , " g tells the new york post .
