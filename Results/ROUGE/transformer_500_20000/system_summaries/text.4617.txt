london 's transport authority said friday it wo n't renew uber 's license to operate in the british capital , arguing that it demonstrates a lack of corporate responsibility with implications in public safety and security . transport for london says the car-hailing app was not " fit and proper to hold a private hire operator , " the ap reports . " it cited its approach to handling serious criminal offenses and its use of software to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app , preventing " officials from undertaking or law enforcement duties . " london mayor sadiq khan said he supported the decision , saying any operator of taxi services in the city " needs to play by the rules . " " he says that " the truth is that there 's no reason to believe it , " per the guardian , which notes that uber has been stripped of its london cars since it 's exhausted the appeals process . the company , which is scheduled to appeal the ruling in september , is expected to announce a new license for uber , which could take months to get the license back of the company .
