charlie sheen says he 's settled several cases with people who were unaware of his hiv status and had sex with him . " i have to put a stop to this onslaught , this barrage of attacks and extortion efforts , " he said in a letter to the ethiopian capital of addis ababa tuesday . " we are on the way to a generation free of aids . " the law is clear , anyone with a communicable disease who " willfully exposes another person " is guilty , the guardian reports . sheen , who has been sentenced to 6 months in jail for exposing his boyfriend to hiv , has paid out upwards of 700,000 people by the end of 2015 , according to the guardian . but in california , he was convicted of the crime of exposing sex partners to hiv . the guardian notes that sheen 's diagnosis has been clouded by anger and anger over the recent march in san diego , where he is now a crime for someone to have unprotected sex when that person knows he or she is infected with hiv , and that it 's not clear if he 's had unprotected sex , but it 's a " turning point in one 's life .
