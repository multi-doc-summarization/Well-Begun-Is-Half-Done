" but let me assure you the cia was in no way spying on [ the committee ] or the senate . " she adds that she has received neither . " her comments wide open a dispute that has simmered behind the scenes in recent weeks about the cia 's use of cia computers , " possibly violating the law . " the cia just went and searched the committee 's computers . " brennan says he 's " not taking it lightly . " the ap reports that the agency has been referred to the justice department for possible criminal prosecution , and that the cia has searched the network for the first time since the cia began monitoring the panel 's computers .
