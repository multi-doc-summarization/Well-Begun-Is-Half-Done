iran makes no distinction between us and israeli interests as separate from america , according to a new report by the fars news agency . " the zionist regime separated from america has no meaning , and we must not recognize israel 's nuclear intentions , " says ali fadavi , the naval commander in iran 's islamic revolutionary guard . " i do n't want to be complicit if they [ choose to do it , " he says , adding that it is " clearly delay but probably not destroy iran . " the white house says it 's not clear how the attack will affect us-russia relations in the region . the israeli military says it has been working with the country to keep israel out of a future war and will retaliate against both countries if attacked . the israeli government , meanwhile , has launched a barrage of criticism from iran over the past two years . in a speech last week , president obama said he was " applying pressure on iran to bomb iran " and that he did n't know iran is nuclear intentions . he also said the us would delay sanctions if iran was attacked prematurely .
