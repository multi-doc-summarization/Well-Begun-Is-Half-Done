the news of the world 's illegal hacking of mobile phones and payments to police in afghanistan is getting a lot of attention . rupert murdoch 's company systematically invades people 's privacy through phone hacking , reports the guardian . " it operates without restraint and has no sense of right or wrong . it does n't yet represent the same threat to british society as the italian mafia does to grow more far reaching , more police officers would be suborned , more trials ruined . " the law , as worded , has remarkably broad scope : where an offence under any provision of this actâ€¦ is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent or wrong , " writes clive goodman in the new york times . he calls the move a " large and powerful media debacle " and says it 's time to " describe how action should be swiftly taken to curb murdoch and his newspapers now that supposition and dark suspicion have become proven fact . " the news is n't so sure , but " there are sufficient similarities to tell us that if we do n't act now , worse will follow . "
