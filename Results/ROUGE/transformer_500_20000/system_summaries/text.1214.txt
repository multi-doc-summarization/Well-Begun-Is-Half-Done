scientists have discovered a new virus that can cause serious liver damage , and half of those infected appear to have cleared it . human hepegivirus 1 , or hhpgv-1—notes that many people understand that humans coexist with myriad bacteria that are not dangerous , but they don ’ t realize the same holds true for some viruses , the guardian reports . " i thought if i want to know whatever is circulating and unknown these are the best samples , " says amit kapoor , a columbia university professor at columbia university . " we really do n't know if there is ongoing transmission of this virus . it 's clearly transmitted as a result of human hepatitis . " the virus can be transmitted by blood transfusions and to the harmless—and even if it 's going to be a significant cause of hepatitis c , which is formerly dubbed hepatitis g , the researchers say . " it is the first transfusion-associated virus that 's been described in a long time , " kapoor says in a press release . " so far there is no need to be concerned , " he says . the team says it has been able to find the virus in human blood , but it 's not clear how common the virus is . " it 's the first time we 've seen it , " lipkin says , adding that it 's " very sad " to see if it comes to a healthy person . ( a recent study found that human hepegivirus may be exhibiting infectious diseases . )
