president trump punched back saturday at canadian and european warnings that his steel tariff plan is " unacceptable " and said they would cause serious disruption of markets on both sides of the border . " if the e.u . wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on us companies doing business there , we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the us , " he said , per usa today . the move follows a sharp rejection from canadian prime minister justin trudeau who called the tariffs " absolutely unacceptable , " reports usa today , which notes that canada is prepared to impose a tariff on european cars if they try to take him on . trump , meanwhile , says he plans to " take responsive measures " of 25 % on steel imports and aluminum , reports the new york times . the tariffs come two days after trump 's announcement of a trade war on european car exports from the european union , which has been criticized for repeatedly threatening policy changes to their homeland , notes usa today . the us imports more than 6 million cars worldwide , and it 's the largest market by far .
