lois lerner , the irs staffer who is under fire for her role in the firing of a house oversight committee , has been placed on administrative leave , reports the washington post . lerner , who heads an irs division that oversees tax-exempt groups , will still be paid while on leave . “ i ’ m not that good at math , ” she says in a statement picked up by the new york times . “ what i think is even more politically and morally suspect and has gotten very little attention . " the move comes after the inspector general found that lerner was in charge of the agency 's targeting of conservative groups , including the corbin <unk> , who had previously been deputy director in a division that processed millions of tax returns a year ago , reports bloomberg . “ i don ’ t know about the targeting until 2012 , ” says lerner . “ it ’ s not clear whether it was a direct violation of the federal government ’ s policies . " the post has a similar take on lerner ’ s firing : “ she ’ s the person who told a conference call about it . ”
