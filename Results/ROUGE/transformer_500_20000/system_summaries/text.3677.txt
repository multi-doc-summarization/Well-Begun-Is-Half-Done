j35 , a 20-year-old member of the long-studied j pod of southern resident killer whales , carried her dead calf in the waters off washington 's coast on thursday , reports ctv news . " we 've had enforcement folks out every day to ensure that where there may be boating that 's not appropriate , " says department of fisheries and oceans marine mammal co-ordinator paul cottrell . " [ boaters ] are being educated and also dealt with . " j35 was first spotted carrying the calf on her nose and in her mouth , and she was accompanied by her family . the calf 's remains were found in the strait of juan de fuca , near san juan island , and the mother whale is believed to have been pushing with her head for at least 17 days and 1,000 miles off the pacific northwest coast of washington state for a ninth day , according to a press release . j35 , who has international interest in the hunt for the calf , has been balancing her calf 's leash and feeding her calf on the nose . researchers say the orca population has been increasing over the past two decades , though the sight of the whale and her pod has n't been seen since . " we do know her family is sharing the responsibility of caring for this calf , that she 's not always the one carrying it , they seem to have to do something very important to protect the whale , " a researcher at the center for whale research says . ( a recent study found a link to the puzzle . )
