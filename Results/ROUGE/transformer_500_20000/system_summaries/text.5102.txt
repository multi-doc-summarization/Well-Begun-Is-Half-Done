krzysztof szczypiorski saw music as the perfect genre of sorts , and he 's got a lot of attention : it 's just like morse , a <unk> techno , and <unk> , reports the new york daily news . it 's a slight increase in tempo , and the line is a lot more complicated than a dj who just won ’ t stop screwing around on the floor , notes the daily mail . “ the shape of this curve could be changed by a mouse and follow up on the dj controller—limited only by manual skills of a spacecraft , ” szczypiorski wrote in a blog post . “ for the live mixing it is just usage of slide on slide on the slide which is visible as a curve in it. ” the experiment , published in the plos one , was designed to analyze the beats per minute or simply listen very closely , if your ear is tuned enough , and it ’ s not the only thing you ’ re trying to do with it . “ we ’ ve got to be careful about it , but we ’ re not sure what we ’ d like to do , ” he writes .
