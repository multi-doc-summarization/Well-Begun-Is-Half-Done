president trump 's decision to pull the united states out of the paris climate change accord is a little more complicated than that . the french ministry for europe and foreign affairs tweeted the white house 's own video with responses to the trump administration 's talking about the deal , which seeks to limit global temperature rises by 2 degrees above levels recorded before industrialization . " we 've seen the @ whitehouse video about the # parisaccord , " the first slide reads , " many major u.s. companies from all sectors , such as exxon mobile , schneider electric or microsoft , disagree . " the video , which has been viewed more than 7.7 million times as of this writing , shows the french president 's pledge to " make america great again " as he urged us climate scientists to travel to france and " make our planet great again . " the independent notes that the deal is n't a " bad deal for america , " but it 's not clear whether the us will withdraw from the agreement . in a statement , french president emmanuel macron noted that " the new french version of the <unk> us video , the paris accord is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
