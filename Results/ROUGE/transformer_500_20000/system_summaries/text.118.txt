the international criminal court has launched an initial inquiry into president rodrigo duterte 's crimes against humanity , the guardian reports . " in this country , people are at a loss where to go if members of your family feel victim to the war on drugs , " harry roque , a spokesman for the international court of manila , tells the guardian . " as we do , we hope to count on the full engagement of the relevant national authorities in the united states . " the icc says it would gauge whether there was enough evidence to build a case . the report says duterte had been directly responsible for “ extrajudicial executions and mass murder ” over three decades as mayor of davao in 1988 , when he began his war with drugs . the guardian notes that the icc 's prosecutor , jude sabio , said the death toll was " a legitimate police operation , " adding that the government has " no such thing as extrajudicial killing . and when we request an investigation from the philippine president and the secretary will say there 's no evidence to support the icc . " the international business times points out that the inquiry is the first preliminary examination in the icc .
