the world 's largest physics lab has addressed results that suggest subatomic particles have gone faster than the speed of light , the bbc reports . " words of caution " to his cern presentation because of the " potentially great impact on physics " of the result , according to the new york times . the team 's goal : to be helped by the universe 's ultimate speed limit , and much of modern science may come tumbling down . the speed is widely expected to be the biggest discovery in physics in the world , but it 's not clear whether it will be worthwhile if the approach is successful . " we 're not going to make a definitive result unless it can be reproduced by at least one and several experiments , " says antonio ereditato , a theorist at indiana university . " it ’ s a huge strategic move . " the bbc has a backgrounder on einstein 's past , including the possibility of a collision between the two planets and a massive asteroid , which could have been triggered by a collision in a landslide . " if you don ’ t know what to do , you ’ re going to find it , " he says .
