south korean opposition lawmakers have set what appears to be a new world record for a combined filibuster of parliament that has been paralyzed due to the political standoff over a government-backed bill . lee jong-kul , floor leader of the main opposition minjoo party of korea , says the bill infringes upon the privacy rights of the citizens . " a total of 49 lawmakers took turns speaking around the clock in opposition to the enthusiasm , " the bbc reports . the party leadership initially said it would give too much power to the intelligence agency , but the bbc notes that the filibuster was passed hours after the filibuster ended . the filibuster is a parliamentary procedure that allows assembly members to stay on their feet for hours . the bill , which is scheduled to take effect next week , is expected to take a closer look at the marathon monologues in chunks of george orwell 's novel 1984 novel 1984 . the filibuster , however , is n't the first filibuster in 47 years . the bbc points out that south korea has seen its first world record since 1969 , when it comes to speeches and academic papers on privacy infringement .
