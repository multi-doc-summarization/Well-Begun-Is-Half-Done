jeb bush took an off-handed jab at women 's health funding and quickly found himself in the middle of a culture clash with hillary clinton . " i 'm not sure we need half a billion dollars in funding for women ’ s health issues , " he said , per cnn . " i was referring to the hard-to-fathom $ 500 million in federal funding that goes to planned parenthood , an organization that was callously participating in the unthinkable practice of selling fetal organs . " bush , the secretary of florida , said he would like to ask him , 'gov , to the mom who caught her breast . " i would tell that to the women who are in the health organizations that need to be fully funded . they provide critical services to all , but particularly low-income women who don ’ t have the access they need . " he also called the comment a " fast and furious " and said , " we absolutely must defund them and redirect those funds to other people 's health programs . " in a statement , bush said that while he has " regards to women ’ rights , " i misspoke , as there are countless community health centers , rural clinics , and other women . " he added , however , that the comment is " not an attempt to make the republican candidates really believe . "
