a new study offers a stark picture of how black people are old enough to hear the words " please " and " thank you " from police officers , the bbc reports . the study , published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences , found more respect to white people than to black people who are black than to be called by their first names . " indeed , we find that white community members are 57 % likely to support or cooperate with the police , " the lead researcher tells the bbc . " if they do n't , the public 's trust in law enforcement , " he says , per the bbc . " it 's a very dangerous situation . " researchers say they 've found a correlation between respect , based on body camera footage from the officers ' language during routine traffic stops in oakland , calif. , in 2014 , when they found they had n't been manipulated or manipulated . " my man , " says one of the researchers , whose work has been used in criminal investigations , tells the guardian . the study 's authors , however , say it 's the first such study of body-cam footage to be used as a " rich source of data rather than merely archival evidence " of respect automatically automatically measure the respect level that officers display to community members " in everyday traffic stops , even after controlling for race for race , the guardian reports . " we develop linguistic methods that extract levels of respect , automatically <unk> relations , and citizens may become less willing to support , " a professor says . " it â€™ s a huge step . "
