a british chef who died fighting in syria turned the gun on himself " to avoid being taken prisoner by isis , " sources tell the bbc . ryan lock , 20 , was fighting as a volunteer with the kurdish people 's army when they were killed in a firefight in the village of ja'bar , the bbc reports . " there are no words to describe the bravery required to take such an action , " kurdish rights activist mark campbell said in a statement . " i personally believe he deserves the very highest of military for such outstanding bravery in the face of such a barbaric enemy . " lock may very well have turned his own gun upon himself rather than be taken back to the uk . " isis were robbed of a predictable propaganda opportunity by ryan 's action . " lock , a chef , had travelled to syria in august having told friends and family he was going on holiday to turkey , " campbell said . " since we heard the british fighter committed suicide in order not to fall captive with isis , it seems that the gun made contact with the bottom of the chin . " the bbc notes that lock was found under the chin , which has been known as isis since the uprisings began in 2011 .
