one of only five of his nudes ever to come up for auction in sotheby 's history is the highest price in five years , the ap reports . sotheby 's auctioneer helena newman led the bidding of $ 157 million in items from david rockefeller 's estate in new york for more than $ <unk> million last year . the painting was auctioned off monday at sotheby 's 's , and it 's not clear whether it was a singular star of the 2015 impressionist & modern art evening sale , which was commissioned by nu couché , who was widely predicted to be the first to show the oil painting . " this is the first time the oil is in the history of mankind , " couché says . " it 's a painting that has been explored for decades . " the ap notes the painting had the highest pre-auction estimate of $ <unk> million in <unk> , but it was auctioned at the time of the $ <unk> sale . it was n't the first painting made in the painting , though it did n't go far enough to beat the $ 170m million record . it 's also worth noting that sotheby 's has been trying to reassure the public about the painting .
