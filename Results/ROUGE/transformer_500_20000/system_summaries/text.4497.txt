president trump 's firing of fbi director james comey has triggered a flurry of criticism over the 2016 election , and it 's not clear whether he 'll be able to slow down or block the confirmation of any fbi director . " frankly we should hold off on the fbi director until we get this special prosecutor , " sen. mark warner , the top democrat on the intelligence committee , tells the washington post . he says the senate has moved slowly , in part because of its rules , but democrats have opposed the gop 's handling of the investigation into russian interference in the election . " the upper chamber has been consumed with processing trump 's nominees for the first months of this year , including the successful confirmation of supreme court justice neil gorsuch â€” well as gop-backed congressional review act measures to roll-back regulation from the obama administration . " the president is a good guy . i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting flynn go . " he says he has n't been able to consider a new replacement for the fbi , but he says it wo n't happen until a special counsel has been appointed to oversee the investigation .
