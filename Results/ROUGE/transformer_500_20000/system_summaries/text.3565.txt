tammar young nine months in their mother 's pouch in australia 's south and western coasts is only the third marsupial to have its genome sequenced , according to a new study . researchers at the university of melbourne say they have even indentified a gene responsible for the kangaroo 's hop . the tammar on a small species of kangaroos and other marsupials from other mammals at least 130 million years ago , reports nature world news . " the tammar wallaby sequencing project has provided us with many possibilities for understanding how marsupials are different from us , " says professor elizabeth murchison . " aside from identifying the evolution of marsupials , and an impressive piece of work looking at one of australia 's iconic species . " the researchers say the gene is a milestone in the study of mammalian evolution , and it 's " a wonderful tool for studying topical evolution and pace to mature more efficiently than we thought , " murchison says in a press release . the study , published in the biomed central journal , is based on mutations in humans and ecosystems , but it 's not clear whether it will be worthwhile if humans do survive the disease .
