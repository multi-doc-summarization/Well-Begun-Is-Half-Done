the taliban will accept a peace deal with the taliban , but the taliban has decided that it will not tolerate foreign interference in any talks . the head of the foreign relations department of the high peace council is a group of about 70 influential afghans and former taliban appointed by hamid karzai , the ap reports . " afghans must be in the lead in the talks , " karzai said in a statement . " no foreign involvement in the afghan peace talks is acceptable . " the taliban have not publicly responded to karzai 's demands . the council is considered the starting point for such a move to strike a separate deal with iran or in turkey if the taliban established a political office that would be authorized to conduct talks on a peaceful end to the 10-year war . " the us and other governments with a stake in the war may try to find out where the us is , " said qasimyar , who was killed by a suicide bomber posing as a peace emissary from the taliban . he proposed that it be set up by saudi arabian forces .
