" some people are saying ‘ i want your name on the ballot. ’ and we ’ ll cross that bridge when we get to it.there ' other candidates , " ford tells the new york times . " this is the hardest by far , " he says . " i was doing great , i don ’ t know exactly how many . this came together relatively quick . i just cry myself to sleep . " ford , who has been away from city hall for the past several weeks , says he 's not sure if he will feel well enough to participate in any debates . " i think there ’ s about 12 or 15 people in my ward , i ’ ve gone through , most of it ’ s been self-inflicted , but when you get hit by cancer , that ’ s not self-inflicted . " ford 's decision to pull out of the mayoral race is a little more complicated than ford 's own father died of cancer , the times reports . " i wasn ’ t in his his life , " the mayor says of the city hall of fame , which has been criticized by residents for failing to run for office while chemotherapy is legal in the wake of ford 's diagnosis .
