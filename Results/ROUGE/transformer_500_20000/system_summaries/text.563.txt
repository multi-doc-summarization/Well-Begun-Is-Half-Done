miley cyrus wo n't be told what she should sing about . the 17-year-old is releasing new album , " ca n't be tamed , " and is doing it her way , even though some say she is going to too far for her age . " i 'm not trying to be like , go to the club and get a bunch of guys ... what i 'm trying to do is to make a point with my record and look consistent , in the way my record sounds and the way i dress , " said cyrus in a recent interview . " now i 'm able to do that a little more freely and , also , i 've just grown up to be this way too . it 's not like this was me five years ago . it 's me now , presently . " cyrus admits to being partial to shorts and hot pants . " i feel more comfortable dressing with my body , i work really hard to be fit and to know that i can wear whatever makes me most comfortable , which is just how i 've always been . "
