joe augustyn , a high-school student who was behind the discovery of the youngest fossil from a weird-looking breed of boneheaded dinosaur , is the smallest ever found , the los angeles times reports . " it 's a little embarrassing to walk by something like that , " says andrew farke , a paleontologist at raymond m. museum of paleontology . " but he was just in the right place at the right time . " the herbivore , which walked the earth 75 million years ago , is believed to be the smallest , youngest and most complete duck-billed ever found . the skeleton was discovered by a student at the grand staircase-escalante national monument in southern utah in 2009 , but it 's not clear whether the specimen will survive . " we now understand a lot more about how parasaurolophus grew its crest , " farke says , per the times . the skeleton of the baby dinosaur was found in the mud at the time of the animal 's death , the times notes . it 's believed the specimen was the smallest dinosaur of its kind , but the museum says it has " no plans to be able to recover the specimen . " the dinosaur 's owner , don lofgren , tells the times that it 's " very sad that two professional paleontologists walked right past the bones before the kid spotted them . "
