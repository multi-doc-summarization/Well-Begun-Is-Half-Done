a federal appeals court upheld the 2013 law that could leave as few as seven abortion clinics in the nation 's second largest state . the decision by the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled tuesday that hospital-like structural requirements for texas abortion clinics can go into effect , which will cause all but seven or eight clinics to shutter , the ap reports . abortion providers say the requirements are unnecessary and won ’ t add to the safety of the procedure . the court said the provision did not impose an “ large fraction of women ” in texas , and the ap notes that abortion clinics have been forced to meet all of the requirements or gain admitting privileges for nearby hospitals and the regulations that mandate where and when a woman can take abortion-causing pills . the court also ordered the clinics to appeal to the supreme court , which temporarily halts the decision . " not since roe v. wade has a law or court decision had the potential to devastate access to reproductive health care on such a sweeping scale , " said the president of the center for reproductive rights .
