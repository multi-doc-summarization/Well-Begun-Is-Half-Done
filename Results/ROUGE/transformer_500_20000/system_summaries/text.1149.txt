scientists have found a way to see through youtube videos from viewers ' brain activity , but they 're not sure exactly what they 're doing . a new study out of uc berkeley found that the brain patterns associated with dynamic informationÂ–shapes , images , and images of brain activity appear to be originating in the brain , the los angeles times reports . " once we had this model built , we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backwards through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw , " researcher jack gallant says . " we are opening a window into the movies in our minds . " the study , published in current biology , found that visual areas of the brain were fed into a computer to program a " movie reconstruction , " the researchers write . they found that mri scans showed the brain activity pattern , and the mri showed that the mri was the result of a continuous , abstract , reconstruction of the actual videos . the researchers say that while the videos are " <unk> , " they have long been able to reconstruct photos and images from reading brain patterns , but this is a " major leap toward internal imagery .
