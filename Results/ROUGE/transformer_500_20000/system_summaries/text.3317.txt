bernie sanders is the choice of 41 % of likely democratic caucus participants , according to a quinnipiac university poll released thursday by the independent . the poll found clinton at 52 % , with 33 % picking former secretary of state hillary clinton and 12 % backing vice president joseph biden , while 16 % were undecided . sanders leads the former maryland gov . martin o'malley , who has a double-digit lead in the state , while sanders has a strong lead in iowa , where he has n't endorsed a policy that includes everything from overturning the supreme court 's ruling on a " rigged system " to strengthen the political power of small dollar donors and dilute the fundraising effort like that of bernie sanders , politico reports . " it â€™ s not going to be easy to imagine , " he says . " it 's going to have to do it . it 's a good thing . " the poll also found that clinton 's iowa edge is within the margin of error , which would be " matched " by the federal government in order to boost the fundraising efforts , politico notes .
