donald trump 's first ambassadorial appointment after a trip to the us ambassador to new zealand has been scrapped , the guardian reports . " we are going to be very , very careful about what we say and how it 's alright , " he said . " even though we all speak english , sometimes when we say one thing it means the complete different cultures and sensitivities , " the guardian quotes brown as saying . brown , who has been feuding with samoa since 2012 , says he plans to address the issue . he says he is " in a different culture " and that he 's " not a good man . " " i was told by my people that you 're not scott brown from new hampshire any more , you â€™ re an ambassador , and you have to be culturally aware of different cultures . " he says the comments were " beautiful " and could make hundreds of dollars working in the peace corps . he says it 's time for samoa to come out of the race , but it 's not clear whether it will happen .
