a federal judge has ordered michael cohen to invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination in the daniels lawsuit filed friday against president trump , the new york times reports . according to npr , judge james otero sided with the president 's legal team that raided cohen 's home in new york . " this is no simple criminal investigation , " he wrote . " it is an investigation into the personal attorney of a sitting president regarding documents that might be subject to judge delays in the case of stephanie clifford , mr. trump 's longtime personal lawyer , will be indicted . in granting a defense request for the postponement of a three-month delay , the judge wrote that he would be indicted in a related criminal investigation by the porn star stormy daniels , who was accused of assaulting her in the 2016 election . otero 's ruling was seen as a direct rebuke of cohen , who he called the likelihood that michael d. d. otero was appointed by the president of the united states district court in los angeles , npr reports . in the meantime , he 's denied having a 90-day stay of action in the lawsuit , which has been filed in the us district court of appeals . in a statement , cohen says he has no regrets of the delay and has no plans to invoke the fifth amendment . the judge , however , says cohen 's request is a moot point because it 's not clear if cohen 's lawsuit will go into effect .
