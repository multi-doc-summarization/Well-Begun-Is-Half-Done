a creature called the tully monster has been found more than a century ago in illinois , and it 's now a species that has been hunted down by a crab . researchers at yale university say they 've figured out the creature 's identity : it 's a most closely related to the lamprey , an underwater bloodsucker . the creature was named the official state fossil in 1989 , but it was n't until late last year , reports national geographic . " it was a tully monster , " says carmen soriano , co-author of the study published in nature . " it is a lot of accumulated information about it . " the study found that 227 million years ago , the <unk> creek in illinois had a population of about <unk> , reports the washington post . the researchers say the species , which are believed to have evolved into the state 's mazon creek geological deposits , have evolved to graze with stalks of crabs and insects . the study also found that a hammerhead in the trunk of its head , and the eyes on the side were n't properly analyzed . the study 's lead author tells the post that " the frustrating thing is that these features are very different from museums . " the researchers hope to find the monster in the next 100 tully monster . ( a study has found that neanderthals may have wandered off the dinosaurs . )
