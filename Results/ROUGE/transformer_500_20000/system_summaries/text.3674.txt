john kerry is urging democrats not to make a move to complete his work . " i think bob mueller 's report will ultimately determine whether or not there are going to be additional steps taken against president trump , " panetta told state of the union sunday . " if you say something bad about her dad , you will know it , whether you 're the janitor or the president of the united states . she is grieving for the father she adored . i think most americans understand that . " kerry , who joined the program with graham , said he was " proud uncle " watching mccain 's speech at the memorial service . " she was direct ... the way john was , " he said . " i did that , others have done that . i think the most important thing that the democrats could do is allow bob mueller to <unk> his work . and i think john mccain did n't know what to do with this . " the former secretary of defense and cia director leon panetta tells cnn that " we 're going to have to do it . we 're gon na be in the hands of the president . " the hill notes that the former independent connecticut sen. joe lieberman , chairman of the house homeland security committee , says that " the democrats are operating in a fact-less environment , by believing in the better angels of american value system .
