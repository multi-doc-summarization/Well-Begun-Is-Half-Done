the president of the united states , and john roberts , who is n't exactly a fan of president obama 's swearing-in , says the president could be dressed so much better . " it looks like his brother is a politician , and unfortunately they are too concerned that their constituents will not appreciate them looking better than everyone else . as opposed to thinking , i should dress well because that 's what people want to do , " he tells the wall street journal . " i saw a documentary on the queen mum during the war and she still dressed to go out and see the people because they expected it . they wanted to see a queen . they didn ’ t want to see her looking like she ’ s a politician . " the footnote is a similar sentiment in the new york times , which calls it " the big " moment from today 's inauguration : the editors at the washington post think it 's time to get the oath of office to make sure the president does n't fit him . " what is he doing ? he doesn ’ t think he ’ s going to have to do this , but i don ’ t know how to do it . "
