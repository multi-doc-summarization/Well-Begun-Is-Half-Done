charlo greene , the owner of the alaska cannabis club , has been sent to prison for the next two decades , the anchorage daily news reports . greene , whose legal name is charlene egbe , has expressed concern on her blog over the fact that she was facing a sentence twice as harsh as the original indictment filed against her last year . " more than 100 million people around the world watched me quit , " she wrote . " and of the now 4,000 members of the cannabis club we ’ ve served to date , there was literally only one person [ at the first court ] to support me. ” the alaska attorney general 's office , however , tells the new york times that greene was unaware of the sentence , which she says was a " modern day lynching " and that the entire world seemed to join in to spread the word of her saying " fuck " on live television back in 2014 , when a reporter for ktva asked him to curse her online . " i do n't think it 's going to be a shame , but it 's not going to happen , " greene says . " it 's a shame that you 're going to have to pay for it . "
