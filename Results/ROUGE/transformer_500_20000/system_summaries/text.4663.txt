ted cruz 's 2016 candidacy is n't the only thing to do with it : the new york times reports that cruz 's campaign has sent a letter to the times asking for its omission from the list . " the times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias called out , " writes rick tyler in the washington post . " the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic purchases " in other words , " someone bought a lot of copies of the book so that cruz would make it onto the list . " the book did n't meet that standard this week . " eventually , the times told politico that the paper has " uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list , which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond the number of people who don ’ t know who they ’ re going to be . " cruz 's camp , meanwhile , says that while the book is excluded , it 's not clear how many of the paper 's signers are . the ap notes that the book , a " time for truth " and " a hotly contested convention in the history of political authors , " has been viewed as " strategic bulk purchases . "
