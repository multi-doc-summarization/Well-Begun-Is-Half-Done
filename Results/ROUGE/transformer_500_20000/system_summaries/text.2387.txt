mitch carter 's lawsuit against the kern high school district in bakersfield , calif. , has sparked a flurry of debate over whether the district 's insurance company will pay $ 10.5 million to a former student injured in a beating during a pep rally at bakersfield high school . the bakersfield californian reports that carter , who will use that money for healthcare-related costs , is liable for monetary damages and was expected to award more than $ 45 million . the jury had already found the injuries he sustained from a beating , but the school 's attorney says it was in the process of trying to make amends with carter 's injuries . " no matter what , i 'd trade everything just to have a full functioning brain , " he says . " but i think that this is a good step in the right direction . " carter , a high school teacher who worked for the school , says he was " shocked and dismayed " when he saw the skit , which he says was " very sad " because he was n't wearing a chicken costume , but he says it 's not clear if the district would have given him more money . " we 're going to have to pay the lion 's share of it , " carter says , adding that the district has appealed to the district , which has a $ 1 million settlement .
