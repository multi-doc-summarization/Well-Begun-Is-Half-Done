freedom industries has filed a chapter 11 petition with the company 's assets and liabilities as a range of $ 3.66 million , reports the wall street journal . the water was tainted after a chemical used to clean coal from a storage tank and then a containment area at a facility owned by freedom industries . the company has at least 200 creditors and is facing multiple lawsuits and state and federal investigations over the jan. 9 spill . the bankruptcy document says the leaky storage tank appears to have been pierced through its base by some sort of object , reports reuters . it also says a current theory for the hole is that a local water line broke near the plant could have made the ground beneath the storage tank in the cold days before the spill . the company says it plans to sell the water for anything other than flushing toilets , but it 's not clear whether it will be forced to close for several days , notes the new york times . the petition , however , says the company is n't aware of the water 's restrictions . " it 's a very sad day for the company , " says an official .
