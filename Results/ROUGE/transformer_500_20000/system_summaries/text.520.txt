" europe belongs to the europeans , " says a dalai lama in sweden . " they should make clear to refugees that " ultimately go back and rebuild their own country . " that 's the message the dalai lama made in 1989 , when he won the nobel peace prize in 1989 . " receive them , help them , educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own <unk> , " he says , per afp . " i think europe , for example , can not become an arab country . " the <unk> , which has been feuding with democrats in the past , was spurred by an increase in rape and violent crimes against muslim countries in 2016 , when migrants settled in the area in 2016 . the <unk> , which the guardian describes as " a visionary in the country 's general election , " was " morally responsible " for helping " a refugee really facing danger against their life . " the <unk> dalai lama has been trying to figure out how to help refugees in germany , where they are n't sure what they 're going to do , but he says he 's not sure how many people are killed in the incidents . " we are going to have to be terrorized by the horrors of our lives , " the lama says in a statement . " we do n't close your doors ' initiative ’ s initiative begins on the anniversary of papal army driving out islamic invaders . "
