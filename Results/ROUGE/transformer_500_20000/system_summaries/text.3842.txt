the social network 's stock opened at $ 42.05 today , and it was n't the only thing that was going to happen : the wall street journal reports that the shares opened 11 % higher than the ipo price of $ 38 a share . that 's because the stock had been predicted to soar on the first day of the session , and the ap notes that it 's not clear how long the ipo will be , but the journal 's sources say that 's not enough to make sense . " we 're going to have a lot of money , " one source says . " it 's going to be very close to the end of the day . " the journal notes that facebook has been stung by a steep volume over the last few months , but it 's still a huge strategic move to keep the stock from slipping below . the journal has a backgrounder on the ipo , including the new york times ' take on the stock market 's ipo , which is expected to hit $ 38 billion this week . meanwhile , the ap has a list of the most anticipated public offering ever .
