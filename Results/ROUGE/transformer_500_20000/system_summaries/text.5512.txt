it 's one of the most exploited , most precious natural resources in the upper two months of groundwater , according to a new study in nature geoscience . researchers found that less than six % of groundwater found close to the earth 's surface is renewable in light of climate change . " we already know that water levels in lots of aquifers are dropping . we 're using our resources too fast - faster than they 're being renewed , " researcher tom gleeson says in a press release . the study found that groundwater accumulated underground water is younger than 50 years old . " it 's a huge leap for the planet , " gleeson says . " we 're going to get to see how much we have and how long before it 's tapped out . " the study , published last month in nature , calls the study " important information to water managers and policy developers as well as scientists from fields . " the researchers say the water is recharged million cubic feet of sand , and that 's roughly twice as likely to be found in the earth . " it is a very big , very large amount of water that has never been known before , " the lead researcher says .
