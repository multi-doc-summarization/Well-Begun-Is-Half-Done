a boy born without ears has been born without one or both ears . kieran sorkin had the surgery at london 's great ormond street hospital , where his ears should be known , the bbc reports . " i do n't want children bullying him because he 's different , " he says . " i just want him to be accepted like everyone else . " kieran , a deaf boy and his wife , were " on cloud nine " after the procedure . " we could not have wished for a better result , " sorkin 's father says . " i 'd like just to look like my friends . " the boy , who has since moved to a school with a deafness in every year , has a rare condition called microtia syndrome , which can cause hallucinations , reports the bbc . he is still about 90 % deaf , but he 's not alone . " i 've always wanted big ears , and now i 'm finally going to have them , " says sorkin , who is recovering from a psychiatric evaluation . " fortunately , there 's no reason to believe that . " ( earlier this month , a 2-year-old boy was found in his own ribs . )
