it 's not junk mail , but a new study out of columbia university suggests that the pigs woke up , and they were eating a lot of bone in a laboratory , reports science translational medicine . the researchers found that the new bone in each pig 's own cells into bone in the lab and then using it to restore a piece of jaw bone from the pigs ' brains . the result is that the pig 's pelvis is an important step for this technology , and it 's a " whole new bone injury that can be painful to withstand the force of chewing , " says researcher scott hollister . " we thought they would be in pain . but no , they did . " the study , published in plos medicine , notes that the study found that cow 's cells attached to the original bone , which is the result of a " scaffold " phase of the bone 's release . it 's also possible that the bone had a similar effect in humans , but the researchers say that 's because it 's " very difficult to imagine . " the researchers hope to find a new way to make humans look better , but they hope to someday find a way to see if the bone is genuine . " we do not capture any email address , " hollister says , adding that " the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it , and that it will be better . "
