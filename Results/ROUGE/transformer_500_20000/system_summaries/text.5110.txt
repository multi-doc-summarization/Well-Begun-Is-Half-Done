united airlines ceo oscar munoz says he has no room for all its booked passengers because it had to transport four crew members to louisville for another flight , the chicago tribune reports . " no doubt will expend thousands of words explaining or apologizing for this incident in coming hours , " he says . " if you stop flying united , the airline will suffer , and at least a sliver of justice will be served . the best part is that there are plenty of other airlines out there that don ’ t abuse passengers and refuse to apologize . " the video , which has been viewed more than 300,000 times , shows the airline reacting to the video . " it ’ s legal , and airlines won ’ t abandon the practice anytime soon because they would leave precious pennies on their flights than the airplane holds a way to guard against passengers who cancel or somehow fail to make it to the airport , " munoz says in a statement picked up by the new york daily news . " it is an upsetting event to all of us here at united . i apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers . " united says it plans to boycott the flight , which is scheduled to begin monday .
