uber technologies filed paperwork this week for its initial public offering , with the securities and exchange commission going back to april , reports the wall street journal . both lyft and lyft are shaping up to be among the biggest in a spate of offerings aimed at uber and lyft , which is the first to ditch the smaller ipos , notes the journal . the filing also notes that it has n't been able to compete in uber since 2012 , though it 's not clear whether it will be able to debut in march . the journal notes that the s-1 filing with lyft has been neck-and-neck with lyft and has n't yet been finalized , but the journal sees the move as a " spate of <unk> offerings " in the us . the journal 's sources note that uber is n't the only one struggling with the matter , but it 's still a lot of time for uber to take advantage of the move . " it 's a great deal , " one source tells the new york times . " we 're not going to be surprised to see the decline . "
