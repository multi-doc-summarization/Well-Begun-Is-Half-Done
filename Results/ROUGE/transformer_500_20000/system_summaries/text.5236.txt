a suburban philadelphia transit worker who found $ 15,000 and turned it in to police has been given the cash since no one ever claimed it . bob tracey was driving home from work last march when he spotted a black bag in the middle of the road . when he opened it , he saw dozens of $ 100 and $ 20 bills and immediately called police . the philadelphia inquirer reports a judge on monday ordered the money returned to tracey . upper darby police superintendent michael chitwood says some people claimed the money was theirs , but they had no proof . he said it was unlikely the real owners would come forward since the bag also contained drug paraphernalia . tracey had to petition the court under a law dealing with finders of lost property , and tracey 's legal team is now trying to figure out how to get the money back , the ap reports . " it 's going to be honest , " says the superintendent of the police department of common pleas judge charles burr ii in a letter to the daily news . " if you do n't know what to do with it , you 're going to do it . "
