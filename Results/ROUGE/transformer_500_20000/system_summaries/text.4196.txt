" he agreed with mr. manafort , " says white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders . " but i don â€™ t know if you know , " she says , per the hill . trump , who has been accused of bank fraud and tax evasion in the 2016 election , says he and fellow attorney jay sekulow had advised the president not to push the issue further . " i think the president is going to make a lot of money , " he says , adding that he 's not worried about trump 's plans for a federal judge to dismiss the case . the revelation comes days after trump accused the white house of " animus and bias " against the president . trump 's lawyers say that while the investigation is ongoing , it will be weeks before special counsel robert mueller 's investigation is resolved . the president , however , denies that any coverup was made , and he says the allegations were not based on the fact that manafort and his allies had been feuding with russians .
