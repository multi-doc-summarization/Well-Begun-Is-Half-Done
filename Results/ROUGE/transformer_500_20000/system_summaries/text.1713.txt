a pair of experimental atomic clocks based on the age of the universe have set a new record for stability . the clocks act like 21st-century pendulums or metronomes that could swing back and forth with perfect timing for a period of time , according to a new study in science express . researchers at nist say the clocks are more stable than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks , including the yellow fiber in the lower center of the timepiece . " in order to understand what 's so special about this table-sized clock , it helps to have a little background : how clocks work inside a clock is a groundbreaking , new level of clock stability , " study co-author andrew ludlow says . the researchers say they 're surprised to find a way to get to work on time . " the optical lattice clock has demonstrated a potential for significant impacts not only on a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds , " ludlow says . the study found that while the clock is ticking , it 's not clear whether it will be in about 10 years or so . the study also found that the tick may be the world 's most stable clock in tick history . " if you 're football games , you 'll be going ! " he says .
