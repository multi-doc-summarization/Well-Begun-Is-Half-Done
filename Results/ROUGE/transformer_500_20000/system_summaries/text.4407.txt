john mccain is a double as rich jewish man , and he 's got a lot of attention . the new york times reports that trevor noah , who was named jon stewart 's running mate in south africa 's apartheid era , has been cast into such doubt . " oh yeah the weekend . people are gon na get drunk & think that i 'm sexy ! " trevor noah tweeted monday . " i still would hav felt so bad in my german car ! " he added , per usa today . the daily show has more on noah , and it 's not clear whether he 'll be able to play a role in the show , but it 's also a stinging example of a " <unk> " that has been shared more than 100 times since the end of the year . " i do n't know what to do with it , " he tweeted . " i think it 's going to be a good day for me . " noah 's mom , jenny <unk> , has a long history of cheekily posting her own thoughts on the comedy central show 's " full-throated support " seemed like endorsement enough . " this is the most blatant anti-semitism in the world , " she said . " it 's a very sad day for our country . "
