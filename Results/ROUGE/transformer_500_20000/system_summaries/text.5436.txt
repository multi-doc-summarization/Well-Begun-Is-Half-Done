benjamin netanyahu is n't the only one praising israel 's " long-standing commitment to a two-state solution " in the wake of the israeli election . " i never retracted my speech in bar-ilan university six years ago calling for a demilitarized state that recognized the jewish state , " he said , per the washington post . " i do n't want a one-state solution . i want a sustainable , two-state solution , " netanyahu said , adding that the us will " still evaluate " its policy on the middle east peace process.with a sharper tone since first reacting to israel 's election results . " the president told the israeli media that a palestinian state would not be created during his speech . he said that " circumstances have to be accepted " were " in droves , but he added that it was a " cynical election day . " netanyahu , however , did n't seem to agree with the white house 's stance on the two-state solution . " it is not clear how many people are talking about it , but it is a mistake that has been used to justify racial tensions . " the post points out that netanyahu 's comments were largely condemned by the israeli prime minister , who said the us would " reassess " aspects of its relationship .
