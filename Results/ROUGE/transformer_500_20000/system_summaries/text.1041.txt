madonna is promoting her second film as director , and she 's not happy about it . in an interview with the toronto star , the singer says she wanted reviewers to focus on her personal life . " i can tell when people are reviewing my film and when they 're reviewing me personally , " she tells reuters . " i welcome criticisms of my film when it 's viewed as an artistic form and not when people mentioning things about my personal life or my achievements in any other field because they 're irrelevant to the film . " she adds that she 's " very punk rock " and that " i had the same kind of pressure when i began my music career . " she says the band 's 1977 single " god save the queen " attacked social conformity and deference to the crown . in a letter to the globe and mail , she notes that the film has been " a lot of fun " for the film . " it 's hard to imagine , but it 's not going to be a good movie , it 's a shame , it hurts , and it 's going to have to do the same as a film director . "
