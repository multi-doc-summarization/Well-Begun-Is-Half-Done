burger king is testing something called the " whopper dog " : the fast food company says it 's doing the same with a tortilla , creating the whopperito hybrid of cheese , tomatoes , and pickles , yes , lettuce , ketchup , and white onions , reports burger king . it 's not clear if the whopperito will hit stores in other cities or states , but that does n't mean it 's a good idea for burger king , which has the distinction of being a conduit to the burger king . " it ’ s not a whopper , " says jonathon <unk> , who runs the company . " we ’ re going to keep an eye out for a while . " he says he 's " sorry " about the " whopperito " of burger king 's <unk> beef , cheese , and lettuce . " i think we 're going to have to do it , " he adds . " i do n't think it 's going to happen again . " he notes it 's possible it 's the first time the burger has come to fruition since it 's been sold for $ 1.9 million , though it 's still not clear whether it will be rescheduled or if it 's rescheduled or tuesday .
