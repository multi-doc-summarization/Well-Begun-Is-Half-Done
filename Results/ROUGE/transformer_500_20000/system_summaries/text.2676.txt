" we want the right to go through the details of the deal and to decide whether we believe congressionally mandated sanctions should be alleviated , " said sen. bob corker , chair of the committee . the deal is n't expected to affect iran 's nuclear program , but it 's not clear whether iran will be able to conduct a nuclear deal between iran and iran . the deal would be barred from enriching uranium to a nuclear weapon , the wall street journal reports . but the committee says the move is a " wait-and-see until june 30th posture , but that republicans want the briefings to discuss possible next steps with members of both parties and democrats . " in other words , politico sees the deal as a tacit admission of guilt over the iran nuclear deal .
