researchers have found a correlation between zika and a spike in birth defects in the brain of a european woman who became pregnant while living in brazil , reuters reports . according to the new england journal of medicine , the virus was found in more than a third of the babies they examined in december 2015 . researchers say the virus causes microcephaly or small head size , but it 's not clear how the mutation caused the brain to collapse in the fetus 's brain . researchers say it 's the first documented case of virus transmission from mother to child , though the study found that the babies born with microcephaly were more likely to have serious eye problems on top of brain damage . the study , published in the jama network of researchers , found that other viruses spread the virus in blood samples from the brain . in the study of the fetus , the researchers found that eye defects were n't the result of the zika virus . " it is a very sad day , " the lead researcher says . " it 's very sad . " the study 's lead author , pier <unk> , says the " zika virus " has been linked to microcephaly in brazil since the birth of a fetus in 2015 . the study also found that babies with microcephaly had a lower rate of brain function than the other fetus . ultrasounds on the molecular level , however , were n't conclusive enough to cause any effects of the virus . the researchers say that while the study does n't support the theory , it may be the strongest evidence to date .
