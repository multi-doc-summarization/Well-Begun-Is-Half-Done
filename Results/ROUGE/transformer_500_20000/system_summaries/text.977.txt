president trump has been crowing about neil gorsuch 's attacks on the judiciary . " any negative polls are fake news , just like the cnn , abc , nbc polls in the election . sorry , people want border security and extreme vetting , " cuomo said in a statement . " the risk that voters , on the whole , will accept the idea that “ negative equals fake ” is probably very low . “ more insidious is the notion that a report qualifies as fake news if it requires a correction , ” he said . “ it is an ugly insult , and you ’ d better be right if you ’ re going to charge a journalist with lying on purpose . " cuomo , who never fought in vietnam , said he would " recognize the logical fallacy of such a statement " and that he " expressed his desire to redefine it as , basically , any reporting they do n't like . at the extreme end of absurdity , trump actually asserted on monday that any negative <unk> followers are " fake news . " cuomo 's response to the tweet was a response to a democratic senator who criticized trump for not wanting to lie about his " service , " the new york times reports . " i see being called fake news ' as the equivalent of calling an italian any of the ugly words that people have for that ethnicity.that ’ s what fake news is to a journalist . "
