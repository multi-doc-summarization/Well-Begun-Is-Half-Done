syria 's civil war has prompted the first withdrawal of seeds from a mountainside to safeguard global food supplies , officials say . " this fall—october 2016—we had extreme weather in svalbard with high temperatures and a lot of rain—very unusual . this caused water intrusion into the tunnel leading to the seed vault , a facility that stores backup seeds for other seed banks all over the world , " the director of the norwegian government-led organization tells reuters . " the seeds and the vault was never at risk . this was no flooding , but more water than we like . so we are doing measures to improve and secure the entrance and tunnel . " the facility is designed to be a backup for the backups , which sank 15 miles into the 100 meter tunnel and then stopped , reuters reports . it 's not clear whether the water will be refilled with the way it passes through the tunnel . the water has leaked into the entryway of the svalbard global seed vault since 2008 . it 's believed to have been damaged by the collapse of the syrian government . the vault 's owner , brian lainoff , says the aleppo seed bank has kept functioning , including a cold storage barrier to prevent it from falling into the ocean . he says that while it 's " very sad " that the vault will remain open until the end of the year , it will take 200 years to complete .
