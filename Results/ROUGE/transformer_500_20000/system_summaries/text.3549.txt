mcdonald 's is giving away 10,000 bottles of its trademark special sauce for people to use at home , reports the wall street journal . the move comes after mcdonald 's introduced the big mac jr. and the grand mac in 1968 . it 's estimated that only one in five millennials have ever tried the company 's flagship product , and it 's also hoping to resurrect its most iconic sandwich , the ap reports . " two all-beef patties , special sauce , lettuce , cheese , onions on a sesame seed bun , " mcdonald 's tweeted tuesday . " sweet got mine ! " the bottles are expected to be available thursday at participating walmarts across the us thursday , and will be distributed at restaurants nationwide . the fast food giant has already introduced a special sauce in the us , but it 's not clear whether it plans to shrink and inflate their original double-decker product . the ap notes that the drop is attributed to the strong results seen from their breakfast program in 2015 , when it comes to sales over the last quarter of 2015 . " we do n't think it 's going to be a good day to get you to buy new versions of its big mac , " says the memo .
