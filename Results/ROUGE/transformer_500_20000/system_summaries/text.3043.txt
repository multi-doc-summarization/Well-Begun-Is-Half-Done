it was christmas eve 2017 , when a student at manhattan 's west village noticed something odd : " i found myself seizing the moment . whereas a decade ago i would have turned and fled the restaurant at the prospect of being in the same place as this man , many years of personal-counseling work ( both trauma-specific and spiritual ) had led me to a place where i now embrace opportunities to look again at the man in the hat , " he tells the new york daily news . " it was a magical night . i was happy . amid the glow of candles and soft lighting . " the student of karma was part of a small group that had just exited the main dining room , and they were now gathering their belongings , likely vacating what was to be our table . " it 's not clear how many people were in the room , but the daily dot points out that there were no carols in sight , but it was n't enough to be true . " i think it 's a good thing to be , " says one man who lives in the restaurant . " i just want to be here . "
