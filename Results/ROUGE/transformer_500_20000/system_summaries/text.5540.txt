idris elba is " too street " to take on the role of james bond , the guardian reports . " i am unlikely to earn as much as from an alex rider , but i can think of other black actors who would do it better , " says anthony horowitz , the star of luther and the wire in which you claimed adonis is a terrific actor . " honestly , it â€™ s a rumor that 's really starting to eat itself , " he says . " for me , idris elba takes no prisoners as he tells event why he 's being lined up as the next james bond . " horowitz has apologized for the speculation , but he says he 's not onboard with the speculation . he says the book will be commissioned by the ian fleming estate to record the audio book for trigger mortis , which is a lot more complicated than it is expected to be , and he 'll be replaced by a bond villain . " we really are , finally , getting a black bond , " the guardian quotes him as saying in a statement picked up by the daily mail . " we are not going to be the underdog . "
