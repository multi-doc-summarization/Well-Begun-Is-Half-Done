president obama is n't the only one making the rounds in the wake of the nov. 8 election , but the washington post has a look at some of the coverage surrounding the cia 's handling of donald trump 's election . here 's what you need to know : it 's " quite clear , " writes ezra klein at the new york times . it 's a sentiment echoed by carl levin at slate , who argues that russia is " attempting to box trump in politically—ordering a definitive report on the american electoral system . " the cia has n't held a press conference in months and instead uses twitter to issue statements and go after trump , he writes , " the united states ’ s intelligence agency concluded that russia used cyber tools to influence the election . " it 's not clear whether trump will go off on unrelated tweet storms , but he also points out that trump has been trying to elect trump as opposed to " meddling with the election . " the story is headlined " russia 's cyber-intrusions " and " russia : the cia is n't going to alienate the russians , " he writes in the wall street journal . the story has n't gone so far as to say definitively , but it has been a doozy of an emerging story . " the post 's take : trump " will ignore us intelligence that influence the result of the election . "
