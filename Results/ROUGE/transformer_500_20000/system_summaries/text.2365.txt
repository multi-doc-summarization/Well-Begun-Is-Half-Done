harvard professor karen king has been introduced to the world by king at a conference in rome 18 months agoâ€”and it 's not the first time the text was written in ancient times , the new york times reports . " gospel of jesus ' wife , " king wrote in an interview published thursday in harvard . " i 'm basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of mankind . " king says the ink has been applied to a blank piece of ancient egyptian forgery , but it 's still not clear whether the ink is genuine . the papyrus itself is believed to be the earliest and most reliable sources on the jesus and which are silent on that question , according to the times . the papyrus is n't encrypted , but the times points out that it 's a " highly skilled figure " in the ink that has been used in the roman empire , and the times notes that the tests do n't prove that the fragment is evidence that jesus was married , and that " it would have been composed much later than the gospels of the new testament , which are regarded as the earliest . " the times has a backgrounder on the papyrus , which has been viewed more than 100 times .
