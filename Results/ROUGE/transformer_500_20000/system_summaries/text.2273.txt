the supreme court on tuesday upheld a government rule that will parcel out the duty to stop or at least reduce emissions that carry smog and soot across state lines , hurting the air quality in states like new york and connecticut , reports the washington post . in a blistering editorial , the epa said that " the court ’ s finding also underscores the importance of basing the blame on the epa ’ s efforts on strong legal foundations and sound science. ” the epa 's formula for dealing with cross-state air pollution is also a win for states such as connecticut , where 93 % of americans have clean air to breathe , notes the wall street journal . “ it ’ s a resounding victory for public health and a key component of e.p.a. ’ ” the court 's majority opinion , however , is that the rule requiring 28 eastern states to reduce the emissions of air pollution as it moves beyond smokestacks and tailpipes . “ we ’ re not going to be surprised to see what we ’ ve seen , ” says one petitioner . “ we don ’ t think we ’ ll do it . ”
