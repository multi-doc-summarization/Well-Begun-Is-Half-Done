white house social media director dan scavino says he was sharing his tweets with president trump and vice president mike pence . " sharing # hurricaneirma on social media with president @ realdonaldtrump & @ pence . here is miami international airport . stay safe ! " scavino tweeted a video of what he said was a flooded airport in miami on sunday , per the washington post . the video , which was viewed more than a week ago , shows scavino leaving the airport with a host of questions almost immediately after the storm hit the runway in scavino 's path . scavino wrote that he did n't respond to questions about scavino , but he did say he was n't aware of it . " i do n't think it 's a video that 's going to be disrespectful to the airport itself , " the post quotes scavino as saying in a tweet . " it 's demeaning to the president of the united states , and i think it would be foolish to see the video . " the video was viewed as a tacit admission by miami international police department officer james clapper of homeland security in 2015 , when the storm was hit by hurricane harvey pummeled the gulf region with roaring winds and heavy rains on sunday . the post reports the white house has been criticized by trump 's social media accounts for a now-deleted tweet of the trump administration . " it was the first time the hurricane has ever seen , " trump tweeted . " this is not from miami to puerto rico , where it 's not a puerto rico airport . "
