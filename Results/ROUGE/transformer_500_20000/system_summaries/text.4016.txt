pandas are n't usually able to eat a lot of bamboo , but they do n't have a problem . the san diego zoo has underwent a dental procedure to fix a broken tooth . the 23-year-old panda was given anesthesia so that a veterinary team could repair the chipped tooth , reports the los angeles times . it 's not clear how long it 's going to be , but pandas are vulnerable to damaged or worn down teeth . " it 's very close to breaking into the pulp canal , " says yun sutherland-smith . " what we attempted to do was a restorative procedure to cover up the part of the tooth that was chipped . " yun yun , a mother of six , has been known to spend up to 12 hours a day on bamboo , which is the primary source of habitat loss for pandas . the zoo says it 's working with thai wildlife officials to figure out where the pandas are . " we are not going to have them , " he says . " we 're going to get them out of the zoo and we 'll find them . we 'll be going to find them in the next 24 hours . " the zoo has already lost much of its habitat in the us , where pandas are recovering in china and canada . ( in canada , a panda recently lost a testicle . )
