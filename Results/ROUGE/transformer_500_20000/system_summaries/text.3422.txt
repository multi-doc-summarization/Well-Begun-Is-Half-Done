two heart transplant patients in upmc presbyterian 's cardiothoracic intensive care unit have been felled by fungal infections , the new york times reports . dr. cyril wecht , a former medical examiner who led the investigation , says the mold may have played in the two patients ' deaths , but it 's not clear what role the mold was , but minnier tells the times it 's " preliminary testing shows that all three patients contracted a different fungal infection : rhizopus for the first patient in the icu in june 2014 . minnier , who was closed sept. 3 , says it was " because of the clinical complexity of their cases . " minnier says he was " flabbergasted " by the findings , though he says he did n't find any trace of the disease , the times reports . " it 's very difficult to imagine if the mold is lurking in toilets and behind it , " he says . " we do n't think it 's going to happen , but we 're not going to be able to find a way to prevent the spread of mold . " wecht , who has since returned to the icu , is still recovering at a hospital in upmc county , where the mold has been found in the same area . " i ca n't remember the last case i ever had in which a mold can spread to the organs , " says minnier , whose research is published in the journal plos one . " it is not common to find molds in lungs , which are vulnerable to infection . " the times notes it 's unclear if the disease may be the result of an infection .
