a new study has found that birds are capable of stringing different sounds together as part of a complex song . researchers at the universities of exeter and zurich say they 've found that the chestnut-crowned babbler birds are n't the only species that could communicate by humans , the bbc reports . the study , published in plos biology , found that animals have long been relegated to the realm of children 's cartoons , but the researchers say they have the ability to communicate with each other . " it is the first evidence outside of a human that an animal can use the same meaningless sounds , " researcher sabrina engesser tells the bbc . " it 's a very basic form of word generation . " researchers say the bird sounds in order to convey new meaning by rearranging , which is why it 's not uncommon for humans to use language in the brains of mice , the guardian reports . " we have no idea what this is going to happen , but we do n't know what it 's going to do with it , " engesser says in a press release . " we 're not sure if we 're going to be amazed . " ( in other <unk> news , a spacecraft was found in the outback . )
