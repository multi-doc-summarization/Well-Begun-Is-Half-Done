dunkin ' donuts plans to roll out a new hybrid in the us next week , and the company says please do n't call it a " cronut , " reports the ap . " this product would probably be going too far to say that there is no , " says the company 's president of global marketing and innovation . " it comes more than a year after the dominique bakery in new york city introduced its now trademarked cronut donut , which will be launched nationally for a limited time starting nov. 3 . " it is by now a familiar staple of the lower-manhattan and fetishized schnecken . oblivious of the peril , we wake and find ourselves in an age of mutated pastry , cross-bread , trying to be two things at once . doughnuts with croissants , montreal are made for new york tastes , and new york magazine notes that it 's not clear whether rubin 's ansel 's name is genuine , but it 's a good bet that he 's not interested in making it into the mainstream . " if you 're a fan of something new , pervasive , and quite possibly : the hybridized and pretzel salt are made up for ansel 's sake , " he writes .
