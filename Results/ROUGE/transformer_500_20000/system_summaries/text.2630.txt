the us and russia brokered a pact to pause the violence on friday after months of back and forth talks . john kerry , who helped broker the ceasefire along with his russian counterpart sergey lavrov , said the ceasefire would be the last chance for peace in syria , the bbc reports . " that should put an end in the syrian civil war or simply another brief hiatus in the death and destruction ? " he said , adding that it was too early to draw a definitive conclusion about how effective the truce would be . the ceasefire came into effect at sunset , but the bbc notes that the sun watches with bated breath . the bbc points out that it 's not clear whether it will happen , but it points to a " seemingly deliberate attempt by those on the ground to send a message of strength . " the bbc has a backgrounder on the ceasefire , which is expected to be triggered by a barrage of airstrikes in the last 48 hours . meanwhile , the syrian army says it is implementing the truce , which will stop syrian president bashar al-assad 's air force from flying combat missions anywhere the opposition is present .
