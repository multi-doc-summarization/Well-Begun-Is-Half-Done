donald trump is n't the only candidate running for president , but he 's got a lot of attention . in an interview with the washington post , the wall street journal calls it " a terrible record for any presidency , " noting that " republicans have never been great at talking about this , " and " those who normally are the most articulate , passionate voices for those who are doing least well in the economy have been muted over the past seven years . " that 's not the first time he 's seen as a consensus candidate in the obama economic crisis , and he says he 's " all too happy to call out obama for failing to lift incomes . " he notes that he 's not sure what he 'll do , but that does n't mean he 's going to do it again . " i think that there are two phenomena here , " he says . " it 's a bit awkward , " says brendan nyhan , a senior strategist at dartmouth , who adds that the " disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks â€¦ jobs are being created , but they 're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were paid for by the gop .
