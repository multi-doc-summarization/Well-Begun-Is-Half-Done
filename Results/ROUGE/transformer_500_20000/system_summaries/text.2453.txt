a swedish man says he was eating grapes from an ikea " blanda blank " metal bowl in the sunshine when he noticed a peculiar smell of smoke wafting from his ikea barbecue . richard walter says he saw it burning in the grape bowl . " i saw there was one intense point where ( the sun hit the twigs , and that 's where it started , " he tells the brisbane times . " how is that possible , i thought . then i saw it was one point . " the bowl , which comes with $ 1.99 and $ 11.99 , has been viewed more than 16,000 times since the incident , reports the bbc , which notes that the fire started when the bowl 's shape caused the sunlight to reflect off its surface and concentrate the heat to one particular point . " it 's not clear what happened , but it 's a question , " walter says of the video . " we 're not going to be able to get it , but we 're going to make it to be a little bit of a buffoon or not , and we 'll be going to see it as a tourist attraction . " the video is n't viewed as a <unk> or a viral video , but a youtube video posted to youtube shows the bowl setting fire to a piece of paper , and it 's now circulating online . ( in the meantime , ikea has been posting a photo of its own . )
