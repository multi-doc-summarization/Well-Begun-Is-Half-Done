the top house and senate democrats said wednesday they had reached agreement with president trump to protect thousands of younger immigrants from deportation and fund some border security enhancements not including trump 's border wall . the deal announced by senate democratic leader chuck schumer and nancy pelosi following a white house dinner would enshrine the protections of daca into law quickly , and to work out a package of border security , excluding the wall , that 's acceptable to both sides , " pelosi and schumer said in a joint statement , per the ap . trump ended the program earlier this month and had given congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the statuses of the so-called dreamers begin to expire . " we â€™ re working on a plan for daca , " trump told schumer , adding that the program provided temporary work permits and protection from deportation . it was the second time in two weeks that trump 's deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , program . the ap notes that the deal would also protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from former president obama . " the wall will come later . "
