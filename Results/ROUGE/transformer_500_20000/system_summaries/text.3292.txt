the supreme court 's decision to block planned parenthood and other abortion providers from their medicaid programs expires monday , and it 's not clear whether states can block medicaid funding for low income women . the court 's ruling expands on the case of planned parenthood , which would have served as the first major abortion test for the court , the washington post reports . " it would have taken four justices to agree to hear the issue , and only three conservative justices -- clarence thomas , samuel alito and neil gorsuch , " the court wrote in turning away a pair of petitions from kansas and louisiana seeking the ban on abortion providers in general . the court also declined to comment on whether the federal law when they terminate medicaid contracts with planned parenthood affiliates who offer preventive care for low-income families . cnn reports that the case is a sign of an effort to avoid high-profile gridlock in louisiana and kansas . the aclu , however , says it 's " deeply concerned " about the case . " the only way to do this is that we are not going to be able to get a fair share of data and resources , " she says . " we 're going to get the funding for planned parenthood . "
