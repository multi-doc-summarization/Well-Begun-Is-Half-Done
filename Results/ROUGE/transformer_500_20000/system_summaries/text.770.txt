los angeles is the largest city to raise its minimum wage to $ 15 an hour on tuesday , the los angeles times reports . according to the guardian , city attorney mike feuer says the plan will bring wages up in a way we haven â€™ t seen since the 1960s . " without a doubt , it was a very big victory , " he says . " this is the new norm , especially in areas that have high costs of living . " the city council voted in favor of a new minimum wage increase to $ 10.50 in july 2016 , and the minimum wage for small businesses with 25 or fewer employees , the guardian reports . " the effects here will be the biggest by far , " mayor eric garcetti says . " the very people [ council members ' rhetoric claims to help with this action , it 's going to hurt , " the mayor of berkeley , calif. , says in a press release . the city has already faced criticism over the effects of a minimum-wage increase in pay inequality . the council 's decision is part of a push to alleviate poverty , and it says it will help employers lay off workers who leave the city altogether . the city 's low-wage work force , which would increase incrementally every year until it reaches $ 15 in 2020 , will increase incrementally in life for the region 's vast population .
