the rich earth institute is investigating whether human urine is found in urine , phosphorus , and potassium , reports the washington post . the project , which has enlisted well over 100 volunteers to donate their urine , aims to create human urine as a kind of all-natural fertilizer , according to a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . " we ’ ve given volunteers a few things to make it easier , some funnel devices and things like that , " researcher rebecca rueter tells the new york times . " it ’ s not as unusual as you might think . " the researchers say they 've found a grain of salt from the earth or the air for agricultural use , but they say they have n't found any harmful environmental effects . " it is a natural fertilizer. , " rueter says . " across the atlantic , studies have long established urine as nitrogen , phosphorus and essential plant nutrients that are mined . " the study found that urine is free and abundantly available , though it 's unclear if the project will replace it . " we are not aware of the technique , but we do n't know what it 's going to do , " says nace , who has been applying human urine to their crops for centuries . " i think it can be a good way to get people to buy fertilizer for their crops . "
