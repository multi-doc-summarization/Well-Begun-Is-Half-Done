fruit flies turn at a speed that ’ s five times faster than their normal turning speed , according to a new study . researchers who had the fruit flies through two laser beams watched the bugs make some talented fighter pilots . “ the insects turn , we might be able to say what the 'pilot ' is faster than we ever thought , ” researcher florian muijres tells the new york times . “ they do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement , ” dickinson says . “ and by looking how the fruit can pitch their bodies and perform turns much like a plane would , ” muijres says . the researchers found that flies would turn like a boat in the water , pitching their bodies at the same time . the flies then execute one of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react to the oncoming threat of the future , reports livescience . “ we discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second , 50 times faster , than we blink our eyes , which react , ” says dickinson . “ it ’ s not like that . ”
