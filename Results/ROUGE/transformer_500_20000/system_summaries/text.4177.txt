richard mourdock 's controversial comments on women 's health care reform have caused a ruckus : " i do n't know how these guys come up with these ideas , " he told anderson cooper . " it ’ s when you do n't own up to it when people will not believe you . " mccain 's call for an apology was " something god intended to happen . " " the only exception i have to have an abortion is in the case of the life of the mother , " mccain said , per politico . " if he apologizes and says he misspoke and he was wrong and he asks the people to forgive him , then obviously i ’ d be the first . " mccain , who has a tv ad he starred in for the indiana state treasurer removed from the airwaves , said he would no longer support mourdock 's supporters . " this is exactly why you ’ ve been around , i ’ ve made a few , anderson , and i ’ m asked for people 's understanding and forgiveness when i wo n't -- when i own up , " obama told cnn .
