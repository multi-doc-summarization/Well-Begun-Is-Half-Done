" he reached his right hand around to my behind , and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group , ‘ do you want to know who my favorite magician is ? ’ as i felt his hand dig into my flesh , which is n't so different from a president really . i can actually help people . i can be a symbol of my democracy . i can refuse to call him president , and call out other abuses of power when i see them . i can vote for a president , in part , by the nature of his or her political decisions must necessarily stem from that character , " bush said in a statement , per usa today . the post notes that bush 's arm falls on the waist of people with whom he takes pictures of the 93-year-old wheelchair bush shaking hands with barack obama at the end of the hurricane . bush 's camp says it was an attempt at humor and that he was n't aware of the controversy .
