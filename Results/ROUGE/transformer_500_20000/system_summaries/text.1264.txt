a chilean mother says a hospital is restricting her access to her newborn daughter because she acknowledged smoking marijuana days before she gave birth . sindy melany ortiz says she smoked pot for medicinal reasons to alleviate pain in one of her arms . she says she 's only allowed to see her daughter two hours a day and is n't allowed to breast-feed her . hospital officials in the southern city of talcahuano say they were just following protocol when they alerted a local court that tests found traces of substances that could put the baby at risk . the court ordered the baby to remain at the las higueras hospital until it takes a decision during a hearing on thursday , the ap reports . " they started to ask me if i smoked or took anything and i told them . when my daughter was born they said she would stay a little with me but i could n't breastfeed her because i had consumed marijuana which is bad for the baby , " the hospital said . " i use this drug only for the pain in my arms , it was recommended by a medical professional to me and i am absolutely not a drug consumer . "
