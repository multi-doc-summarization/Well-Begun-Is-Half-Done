" it ’ s a very dangerous situation , " says a spokesman for the fda . " we ’ re going to have to make sure that this is going to be a big deal . " the fda has n't commented on the specifics of the fish , which are genetically engineered by the fda , but the fda warns that the fda will use the fish to refuse to sell it to the fda .
