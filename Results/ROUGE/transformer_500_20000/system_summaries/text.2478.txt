ryan gosling and rachel mcadams are back and better than ever with a new us tv show , but they were really not getting along one day on set . " maybe i 'm not supposed to tell this story , " she tells us . " and ryan came to me , and there 's 150 people standing in this big scene . really not , " the director of vh1 's state of affairs and animated movie says , " i was so stoked to be doing them . but maybe i hit it a little too hard . i couldnï¿½t say no . thereï¿½s nothing wrong with them , but i overloaded my audience . i should have done a superhero movie or a psychological thriller . ' ' i stopped challenging myself . it became a bit by rote and <unk> , " he says of the rebooted hollywood machine . " 'and i didnï¿½t expect it . i was taken by surprise and angry at it for betraying me . ' i had an amazing time . i love romantic comedies . i ca n't do it with her . and shut down all the noise .
