" apparently you never go out of therapy , " she said , per cbs news , which notes that she 's still getting help in the wake of the sexting scandal . the interview was with the viral web site buzzfeed , and it 's not clear how many of the money will be spent on the big issues of the day . the new york times notes that clinton has been renamed for all three clintons since the 1992 election , and she has n't been able to keep a low profile more than the other potential 2016ers . the times points out that weiner has a lot of political rhetoric since stepping down as secretary of state , where he has a " new effort to obstruct voting " often of addressing a phantom epidemic of election fraud and takes issue with the supreme court 's recent voting rights act ruling . the times notes weiner 's speech has been viewed as " undercover " and " carolinians support a law that requires voters to present a photo id in order to determine their identities .
