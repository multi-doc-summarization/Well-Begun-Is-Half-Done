president obama 's plan to raise only $ 3 billion for millionaires and billionaires , and it 's time for republicans to reject tax hikes , writes ezra klein in the washington post . the president did a very effective job at putting republicans in a box , but it was the usual bashing of the bush tax cuts , he writes . " if we choose to keep those tax breaks for jet owners , if we keep the tax break for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars , then that means we ’ ve got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship , " he writes . " that ’ s not what we 're going to do . " at the new york times , chris cillizza sees the deal as a " surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high tax cuts over ten years , " noting that the cuts are " not the result of a massive tax hike in the house , " and that 's not the case . he also points out that the deal is a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> deficit , and <unk> deficit reduction " in the gop 's priorities and the slashing of the middle-class tax rate . he also says that if the gop approves of the plan , he would be willing to bring it in an additional penny in revenue , which means it 's " a lot of people who are going to pay for millionaires , corporate jets ( made by cessna and hawker-beechcraft ) .
