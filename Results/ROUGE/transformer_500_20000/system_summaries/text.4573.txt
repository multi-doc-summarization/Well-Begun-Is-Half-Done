the great barrier reef collection has failed to achieve even modest targets and more money is needed to reduce pollution , the guardian reports . " it would be like a locust plague devastating vegetation , " glen holmes says in a press release . " this will give the reef a chance to rebuild its coral cover and grow again . " according to the new york times , the number of crown of thorns starfish could soar from four and 12 million to 60 million by 2020 . " if we cut catchment pollution we can starve the baby crown of <unk> starfish and prevent the next outbreak before it happens , " holmes says . the outbreak is believed to be the worst on record , conservationists say , though it 's not clear whether the outbreak will affect the lives of coral reefs or other species , the bbc reports . the outbreak has caused a wave of deaths in the past 30 years , with the steepest declines occurring in 2016 and 2016 . in 2016 , researchers say they 've found a sea turtle swimming among a school 's fish and manta rays , and they hope to dive into the ocean with google maps and maps to track the movements of the starfish , who are currently at large . the researchers hope to find out if they 're a marine biologist , who has been studying the effects of climate change . the study , published in the world 's first underwater edition of the world wonders project , is expected to take a closer look at the ocean 's surface .
