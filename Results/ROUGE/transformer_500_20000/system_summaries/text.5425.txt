a new study has found that guenons live side-by-side mating with other species , including bushy blue , yellow or brown faces as many as 35 guenon species , reports the new york daily news . researchers say they 've found that the animals may rely on their patterns to recognize different species , but they 're not sure if they 're infertile or less healthy . " animals use coloration and patterning for a whole host of different reasons , " study author william allen says . " we rarely do so in the wild . " the researchers say that while guenons can interbreed in zoos , the animals ' faces have evolved to feed and sleep together increasing the likelihood of interbreeding between them and their offspring . the study , published in nature communications , notes that the monkeys live in the forests of central and west africa , eating fruits , insects and leaves , sometimes called cheek pouch , which is the size of cats and dogs . the researchers also note that guenons and whistles are the best evidence to date of visual signs acting as a barrier to breeding across species such as <unk> and horses , which have been linked to humans in the past for years .
