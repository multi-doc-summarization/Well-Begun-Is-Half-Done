mcdonald 's is committed to using 1.8 million straws a day in the uk , the bbc reports . according to the bbc , the restaurant chain will replace the plastic ones in all its uk and ireland in september . the move comes after a successful trial in selected restaurants earlier this year . " reflecting the broader public debate , our customers told us they wanted to see a move on straws but to do so without compromising their overall experience when visiting our restaurants , " mcdonald 's ceo paul pomroy said in a statement , per the bbc . the ban does n't yet extend to the rest of the chain 's empire , but it 's expected to take effect next year . mcdonald 's will also be completed by 2019 , though it 's unclear whether it will be able to take hundreds of years to decompose when it comes to paper straws , the guardian reports . the move will be implemented in september and will affect restaurants in the us , france , australia , and sweden , which are already taxing the straws . the company says it will do the same later this year .
