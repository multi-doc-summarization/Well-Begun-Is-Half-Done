parkinson 's may be a gateway to sin , but a new study out of the university of medicine suggests that doctors and patients may be wary of the drugs ' side effects . researchers at johns hopkins university report in the journal jama psychiatry that they 've found that the pathological behaviors are linked to the use of certain drugs commonly used to treat parkinson 's disease , and the researchers say the drugs are prescribed for restless leg syndrome and hyperprolactinemia , a hormonal condition that can trigger milk production , reports the new york times . " in our view , these medications should be used less frequently and with great caution , paying close attention to possible untoward effects on behavior and impulse control , " says the lead researcher . the study , published in 2.7 million serious domestic and foreign drug event reports , is based on data from 2003 to 2012 , when the researchers found the drugs were prescribed for prescriptions . the researchers also found that those who ingested the substances with the dopamine agonists have more than twice the rate associated with sex , reports npr , which notes that the fda has n't commented yet on the findings , but it 's not clear whether it will be able to carry out a clinical trial or if it is rescheduled or later .
