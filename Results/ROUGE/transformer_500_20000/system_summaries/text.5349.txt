catalonia 's regional parliament passed a motion friday to establish an independent catalan republic , the ap reports . the vote was approved with 70 in favor of independence , 10 against and two blank ballots in catalonia 's 135-member parliament . rajoy immediately called for calm despite the vote , which spain is deeply set against . no country in the world has expressed support for independence for catalonia , a region of the country , and the region 's independence bid . the ap notes that the spanish government must now decide how and when to apply the measures to take control of catalonia 's autonomous powers and halt the independence of catalonia . the ruling came shortly after the catalan parliament voted in barcelona to secede from the eu in a ballot measure that would allow the government to apply to the opposition . the ruling was a sign of independence from the catalan government and the opposition of the ruling party . " we are not going to overrule them , " a catalan official tells the ap . " it 's going to be a long journey and it 's a westerner . "
