the oklahoma department of corrections is in dispute with the city of mcalester over who owns the state 's unwired electric chair , reports the guardian . “ we haven ’ t had much discussion about it , because it ’ s not been real pressing at the moment , ” says a spokesman for charles warner . “ my assumption would be if it ever got to the point the electric chair was story_separator_special_tag ” harrison says the chair has not been used since 1966 . “ there is not much possibility of that , unless lethal injection is declared unconstitutional , ” he says . “ i don ’ t think it does anybody any good for it to sit in storage . " he says he expects if oklahoma planned to electrocute an inmate , the state would get a new electric chair if lethal injection was found to be unconstitutional . “ i ’ m not sure anybody has the complete story on who legally owns it , ” said harrison , who appeared to be a massive heart attack and died 43 minutes after the execution of clayton lockett in april . “ i would like to get it displayed somewhere since it is a historical place , ” harrison said in a friday interview . “ that ’ s what we ’ re going to do . ”
