researchers have discovered a new discovery in the moon 's soil : hydrogen ejected from the sun 's atmosphere is carried in solar winds and implanted in the lunar soil , space.com reports . " now we have ready sources of water that can not only be consumed by plants and humans , but also electrolysed into its constituent elements on the moon , " says a geochemist at the university of tennessee at knoxville . " this is paramount to human settlement of the moon in the near future . " the researchers say the water would be of most value as rocket fuel , and it would be complicated and using it for human settlement . the study found that hydrogen and oxygen on their surfaces were not wet , but it 's not clear whether the moon is unrealistic . " i think it 's a pretty long shot , extracting the water might be as much trouble as it 's worth , " the lead researcher says . " it is essential that we develop processes of producing water from the materials . " ( another geological marvel at nasa is n't so sure . )
