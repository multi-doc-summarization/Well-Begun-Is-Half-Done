a new study has found that 58 % of patients with cancer have a better chance at survival , reports the chicago tribune . the study , published in science translational medicine , says that while it 's not uncommon for patients to have late-stage cancers , the blood test detects many early stage cancers , including ovarian cancer , and 71 % of the time when assessing 200 patients previously diagnosed . " to our knowledge , this is one of the first studies that has looked directly at early-stage cancers , " says dr. victor velculescu of the johns hopkins cancer center . " if we are able to detect cancer earlier , our chances of saving lives will be higher . " the researchers say they 've found a correlation between the disease and the disease , and they hope to identify whether cancers are returned after surgery . in the meantime , researchers say it 's possible that dna testing will be used to help patients with late-stage tumors . ( in other cancer news , a study found that cancer is n't the only cause of death for cancer . ) the study also found that dna from the patients who diagnosed with cancer in the first place were more likely to develop cancer than nonsmokers .
