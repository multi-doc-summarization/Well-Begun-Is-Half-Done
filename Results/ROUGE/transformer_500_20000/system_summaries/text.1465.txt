a norwegian captain has told a newspaper it was a " stroke of luck " that he discovered the boat of two teenagers lost at sea last july , the palm beach post reports . havard melvaer melvaer was in his office aboard the huge supply ship when he stepped outside for fresh air and spotted the 19-foot-long boat . last summer , austin stephanos and perry cohen , both 14 , had left jupiter inlet , florida , in the boat and never returned . lengthy searches turned up no clues . " you kind of think a little bit and try to understand the concept of how big it really is , " melvaer tells the post . " it 's amazing . we kind of felt like it wanted to be found. . " the coast guard initially located the boat off new smyrna beach , but a company hired to retrieve it could n't find it later . " we were basically just crossing exactly where it was at the time , " he says . " there was no skill involved . it just took a pair of eyes looking in that direction at that point . " melvaer says the boat 's in a shipping container and will arrive in florida in may .
