john mackey , the libertarian ceo of the wall street journal , says he 's " like fascism " in an interview with npr . " technically speaking , it ’ s not a system any longer where people are running out of other people 's money . these deficits are simply not sustainable . they are either going to result in unprecedented new taxes and inflation , or they will bankrupt us . while we clearly need health-care reform , the last thing our country needs is a massive new entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system , " mackey says . " in fascism , the government owns the means of production , but they do control it , and that 's what 's happening with our healthcare programs and these reforms. ” mackey , whose remarks were condemned by critics of the health reform law and the national institutes of health and social entitlement reform , says mackey should be trying to achieve reforms by moving in the opposite direction . " i think that we no longer have free enterprise capitalism in health care , it 's more like fascism than it is , " he says , adding that the government is " where the people are doing often control their “ means of <unk> production . ”
