the retired king of the belgians has been ordered to take a dna test by a brussels appeals court . king albert ii , who abdicated in 2013 , has contested boel 's claim for more than a decade , the guardian reports . the 84-year-old monarch , who has two children on the throne , is not the daughter of jacques boel , who is 83 and albert 's italian wife , which is believed to be her father . according to reuters , his lawyers say they were pleased with the " strong affirmation of the principle of acting in the interests of the child " and " as she seeks legal confirmation of her true identity . " the court 's lawyers say the paternity test is a result of a " <unk> " that would be a saliva test carried out on albert 's throne in 2013 . the court has ordered the king of philippe to take the test within three months or risk being presumed to be the result of the legal argument . the ruling is a tacit admission of guilt over his son 's death in 2013 . it 's not clear how long the ruling will be , but a royal house lawyer says it 's " very sad " that the ruling " raises the question of whether he 's going to be able to challenge it .
