" i thought i 'd had a concussion , but i had forgotten that i had my earplugs in from [ shooting ] the gun ! " jolie says in a statement , adding that " today 's victory marks the end of the litigation brought by brad and angelina . " jolie , 35 , joined 'salt ' co-star liev schreiber for a panel on their upcoming film , salt lake tribune reports . " when the news of the world failed to publicly retract the allegations and apologize for them—thereby leaving their readers in the dark as to the true position—the couple felt they had no alternative than to sue , " she says . " it was a very difficult time for me to think about it . " she adds that she was " shocked " when she compared her new movie to past films she 's done like 'wanted ' and the 'tomb raider ' series , and that 's not the only one that 's been prodded by the media , which she says is " embellished " and " intrusive " about the " insidious " breakup . " i think it 's a good thing to be a good idea , " jolie adds , noting that she has n't been seen as a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . "
