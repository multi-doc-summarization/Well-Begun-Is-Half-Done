the sequester is n't lunar lunacy , but it 's a good day for house republicans to pass a bill to replace the sequester . " we survived them all . we have grown strong at the broken places . but now the pols have come up with a new word to us witless . but , in truth , hearing a politician tell us , “ we are heading toward sequester ” is really no scarier than hearing the words , " i don ’ t like the looks of that mole . " the washington post notes that house republicans are pursuing a strategy of deliberate idleness . “ the president says we have to have another tax increase in order to avoid the sequester : border security , head start , public housing support , nasa , and special education , ” says rep. mike lee of fox news . “ senators should get 'off their ass ' it is supposed to be so horrible that both the republicans and democrats in congress would recoil from it . all sorts of things will be cut under a 2.5 % cut in all federal spending without coughing up a single dollar in tax increases . ”
