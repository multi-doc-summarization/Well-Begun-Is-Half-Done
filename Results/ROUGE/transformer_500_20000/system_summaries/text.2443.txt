" donald trump gets weirder , " says gail collins of the new york times . " but you can tell obama did the second book himself because it read like it was written by somebody of average intelligence with a high school education. . " in a letter to trump , she writes , " her storytelling and word usage ( coming from me , who has written many best sellers , is not at a very high level . more importantly , i have some real doubts . i have people that actually have been studying it , and they can not believe what they â€™ re finding , " she writes . trump is " extremely sensitive to any gibes about his business record , which has been up and down over the years . " she adds that she has survived so long with so little talent . she says that while she was born in kenya , she was there to watch a " financially <unk> " in the us , she says , " i do n't need ms. collins 's advice . " trump , meanwhile , has " nasty and derogatory articles about me . actually , her facts are wrong ! "
