" yes , i 'll continue to sit , " colin kaepernick said on sunday afternoon . " i 'm going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed . to me this is something that has to change . when there 's significant change and i feel like that flag represents what it 's supposed to represent , this country is representing people the way that it 's <unk> 'll stand . " the washington post reports that kaepernick , who was spotted sitting between two gatorade jugs during the national anthem in friday 's game against the green bay packers , has been speaking out about the military 's stance on police brutality and racial inequality in the united states . the 49ers ' first three games in the nfl , comprised of three games and a half of the players , will play a role in kaepernick 's anthem . " i do think that the talk has been more about me , more about i know a lot of people 's initial reactions thought it was bashing the military , which it was n't , " kaepernick said . " that was n't my intention at all . i think of the soldiers . soldiers that have died for our rights , and a right that he exercised . so i get why people are mad . i â€™ m not ( as ) focused on how he did it , but the message he made in his own mind .
