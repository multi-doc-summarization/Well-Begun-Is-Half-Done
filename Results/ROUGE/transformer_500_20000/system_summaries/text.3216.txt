rick santorum is not running to be " pastor in chief " and that clergy should be working harder , the hill reports . " it 's not because i want to be the pastor of the united states , " he said . " there are pastors all over here who , you know , you guys can do a little better than you 're doing right now , i 'll be honest with you .

" " i have no intention and no desire to be <unk> pastor of this country . " on the other hand , he said he was " leaving that to you , all right ? but that does n't mean i 'm not going to stand and fight for the things that are consistent with what this country was founded upon , which was a moral foundation , " the hill notes .
