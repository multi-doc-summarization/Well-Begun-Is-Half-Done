airlines may be forced to cut their loads of passengers ' cargo or fuel in order to take off the ground , according to a study published in climatic change . the study found that airports could rise by 7 to 14 degrees fahrenheit , reports reuters . " our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world , " says lead author ethan coffel , a columbia university researcher . the study , which is the first such global analysis , found that heat waves that pose a larger threat to the airline industry . the study also found that temperatures in airports are more likely to be hard hit than those in new york and dubai . researchers say that while warming is n't a one-off event , it will make it harder to get off to recharge the flights . the researchers say the accelerated heat wave will hit airports with short runways and forget about rain and missing flight crews . " it 's going to be very difficult to predict where the earth is going to have to do it , " coffel says .
