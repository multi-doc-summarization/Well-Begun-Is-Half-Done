boys ' names that connote a " generally attractive person , or its opposite chapter 19 , " as the new york times puts it , are n't exactly a household name . the names of girls ' names , connote an ethical-caring person , and a <unk> person , as well as their chronological age of 16 , are " connote " ( meaning " girls " ) , and they 're not the only ones who do n't have a maternity leave policy , but they 're also a naming consultant who says it 's " never going to be paid for several months , " reports the chicago tribune . it 's not clear whether the price is the right to name the firstborn , but it 's a good example of how the firstborn could be named for him . " i think it would be a good idea , but i would n't be surprised if i did it , " says linda murray . " i would like to say , 'that would be the <unk> ' of the <unk> ' ? ' " she says .
