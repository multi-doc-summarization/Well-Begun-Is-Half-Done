the mormon church of jesus christ of latter-day saints has decided to perform at the upcoming inauguration of donald trump , the salt lake tribune reports . " to be perfectly frank , there have been times when members or leaders in the church have simply made mistakes , " harry reid says in a statement . " there may have been things said or done that were not in harmony with our values , principles , or doctrine . we believe the incoming president has demonstrated sexist , racist , and xenophobic behaviors that do not faithfully represent its diverse 15+ million worldwide membership . " reid , who has been with the choir for five years , says the church will " severely damage its image and principles of mormonism . " she says the choir 's participation in the inauguration was a " mistake and not in <unk> roses to hitler , " and that " many good people throughout this land and throughout the world already do and will continue to feel betrayed . " chamberlin , a staunch supporter of the mormon tabernacle choir , says he 's seen a lot of criticism . " i only know i could never look myself in the mirror again with self-respect . ' and i certainly could never sing for him , " he says . " i know that i too feel betrayed . "
