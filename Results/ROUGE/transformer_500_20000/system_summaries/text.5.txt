the death penalty is shaping up to be a big day for the supreme court , and the justices are expected to hear arguments over the constitutionality of capital sentences in florida , reports the new york times . stephen breyer will be 78 , and justice ruth bader ginsburg will be 80 . here 's what critics are saying : " constitutional law and politics are certainly not the same thing , but they are interrelated , never more so than in a presidential election year that will likely determine who gets to appoint the next justice or two or three , " writes nina devins at the wall street journal . " this coming term will again put into focus that the court is divided along partisan lines and that the 2016 elections will be hugely consequential in shaping constitutional and other law for perhaps a generation or more , " he writes in the washington post . the court 's ruling is based on a 5-4 ruling last term involving a sedative used for lethal injections . the court has been criticized by critics who say it unfairly makes it easier for clinics to get contraception . " the court will reject the split , but it 's not clear whether it will be rescheduled to late 2017 , but the new term is inaugurated as a result of a 10-year ban on clinics and telecom companies that have n't been taken up to the high court . " the justices will be able to weigh in on the case , and they intend to vote on whether they will be forced to go to the us illegally as children , " says vikram d. klein , who co-authored the ruling .
