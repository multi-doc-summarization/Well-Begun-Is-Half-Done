donald trump 's remarks were " just plain wrong , " but he did n't seem to agree with them . " you know , a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening . we 're going to be looking at that and many other things , " trump told suzanne malveaux at a town hall event in rochester , new hampshire . " the real mogul is one . you know he 's not even an american . " " a seemingly bewildered trump interrupted the man , chuckling , " we need this question . this is the first question . " " anyway , we have training camps growing where they want to kill us . " " we have a problem in this country . it 's called muslims , " an unidentified man who spoke at a press conference said . " you 're saying that 's my question : when can we get rid of them ? " the remark drew boos , applause , and applause . " i was appalled . " clinton , who has shaken off several controversies since the election , tweeted that " is anybody really surprised that this happened at a donald trump rally ? "
