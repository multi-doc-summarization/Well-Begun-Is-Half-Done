alzheimer 's is the most common form of dementia , according to a new study . researchers at the university of california found that just 54.3 % of people with mild cognitive impairment were taking medication for alzheimer 's , reports the washington post . the study , published in the alzheimer 's association international conference in london , is testing over 18,000 medicare beneficiaries in their brains , including those with alzheimer 's and dementia . the researchers say the scans could be used to screen many thousands of patients at risk of alzheimer 's disease , and they hope to find a way to lessen the effects of the disease . “ it ’ s a really good idea , ” says the lead researcher . “ we ’ re not going to be surprised to see how this is going to happen , ” he says . “ it 's a really big deal . it 's going to have a lot of people who do n't know what they 're going to do . " the study also found that alzheimer 's patients tended to have sticky clumps of beta-amyloid , which can be seen in a person 's brain before memory loss and brain damage . the results could also be replicated in a <unk> or <unk> plaque that can detect abnormal cognitive impairment , but researchers say it may be possible for a reliable diagnosis . the study is based on data from the memory and aging center , which has a simple blood test to determine if medicare is paying for pet scans that find amyloid plaques .
