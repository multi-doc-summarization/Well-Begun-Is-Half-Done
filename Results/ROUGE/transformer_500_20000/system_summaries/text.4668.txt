researchers have discovered the earliest known step on the evolutionary path that led to fish and sand in central china , reports the bbc . the creature , known as saccorhytus , is so novel that it has its own family ( saccorhytidae ) , which is the oldest prehistoric ancestor of humans . the study , published in nature , is based on a number of theories about the origin of life , including vertebrates , and starfish . " we think that as an early age , it is the most primitive example of a category that encompasses a broad range of species , " says researcher jian <unk> of the university of cambridge . " it 's a wrinkled family . " the researchers say the remains of a microscopic sea animal are " exquisitely preserved " in latin , " and " rhytis " means " wrinkle " in greek . the study also found that saccorhytus is the earliest prehistoric ancestor to have lived 540 million years ago , and the researchers note that the creature was probably no more than a millimetre in size , but the study shows that the sea animal 's body and large mouth is likely a lot bigger than thought . the study found that the 540-million-year-old creature 's <unk> evolved from <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and it 's not clear whether it 's the oldest ancestor to be found . the researchers say <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
