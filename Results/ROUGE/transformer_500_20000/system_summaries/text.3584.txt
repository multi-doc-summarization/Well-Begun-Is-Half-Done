the us military has no plans to suspend any more major military exercises with south korea , reuters reports . " we took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the singapore summit , " defense secretary james mattis said in a pentagon press conference tuesday . " as you know , we have no plans at this time . " mattis said the us would stop its " war games " with south korean leader kim jong un , who wants to give up his nuclear weapons , the new york times reports . he even adopted north korea 's description of the exercises as " very provocative. " the next military exercise in south korea had been set for next spring . mattis said trump 's decision to suspend the drills caught many american military planners off guard and was broadly opposed to north korea . the north is n't willing to give concessions to kim without tangible steps on denuclearization . the white house says the move is " a good-faith gesture to north koreans and the united states and the korean people . " in the wake of the june summit , trump said the drills would be " very expensive " and that " we are going to have a lot of time to suspend them . " the military is also planning a meeting with south koreans after his june 12 visit .
