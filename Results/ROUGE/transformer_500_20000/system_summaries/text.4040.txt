a us government theory that sonic weapons may have been used in the us and canadian diplomats on the island of havana , but it turns out that it 's not junk mail . in an interview with cnn , dr. mitchell valdes-sosa , a well-known neurologist who is part of the cuban special task force investigating the alleged attacks , says it 's science fiction , not science . " first , it was sonic weapons , now microwave . what 's next , kryptonite ? " he says , per cnn , is a " kind of weapon that does n't exist , " and the government not only denied involvement in the attacks but cast doubt on whether they actually occurred . valdes-sosa says the theory is " implausible to elicit auditory sensations , individuals must be exposed to intense but brief ( microsecond ) pulses of microwave energy " and " very real brain damage " in the microwave effect . broad says the <unk> were " employing a long article in the new york times " and that the " acoustic weapon to harass embassy employees . " broad outlines the idea of a sonic weapon , including ultrasound waves , confusion , and hearing loss of the brain and skull fragment . the researchers say they are working on a paper to rebut the weapons theory . " we do not capture any email address , " valdes-sosa says , adding that the government " has been aware of this . "
