scientists from the aarhus university of wyoming are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth 's crust that 's responsible for the famous faithful and other features at yellowstone national park , the ap reports . the device acts like an x-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface . " nobody knows anything about the flow paths " for the hot water erupts from yellowstone 's geysers , says lead scientist carol finn with the us geological survey . " does it travel down to yellowstone , of being able to look at a large part that 's underground that people that have not looked at , " finn says . one such explosion , or possibly multiple explosions , that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles across at the bottom of yellowstone lake . " this is really kind of a last frontier if you will , in yellowstone , " he says . the team also plans to map the underground features if they are flying over solid earth , and it 's not clear whether it will take a photo or video of the hydrothermal hydrothermal vents in the park .
