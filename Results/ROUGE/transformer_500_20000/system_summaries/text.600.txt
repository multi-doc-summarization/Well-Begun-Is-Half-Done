rescue crews are searching indonesian waters for airasia flight 8501 , the head of search and rescue in the province of bangka-belitung , cnn reports . the plane was in the safest part of its destination , singapore , when it vanished from radar . " our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea , " indonesia 's search-and-rescue agency said in a statement . " just 10 % of fatal crashes from 2004 through 2013 occurred while a plane was at cruise elevation . " authorities do n't know whether there 's any connection to the missing jet , but the plane 's surface has yet to be examined . the search teams will be checking the area where indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke rising from the island . the ap notes that while the smoke was seen on long island , it could have been a factor in the metal fatigue caused by the cycle of pressurization and corrosion . " it 's not a drill , " an oceanographer tells the new york times . " there is a lot of debris in the water . "
