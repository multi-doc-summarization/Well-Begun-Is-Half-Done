swimmers , live on the antarctic continent and on many small , surrounding the journeys of antarctica . the australian antarctic division announced wednesday that there are 5.9 million penguins on a 5,000 stretch of coastline in east antarctica , the bbc reports . " the reason it 's higher is we have incorporated the non-breeding component of the population , " ecologist louise seabird says . " the breeders are very well behaved . they come to the islands and are out foraging at sea , rather than nesting in colonies on land . " researchers say the extra 3.6 million penguins were living in the whole area of antarctica . the steepest declines were steepest declines in the region , and researchers say they 've found a correlation between conservation and conservation . " the non-breeders are essentially an invisible component of [ the population ] . the non-breeders birds are harder to count because they are foraging , " says seabird , who warns that if the population of 14 to 16 million drops , it would be more likely to come up with the help of the migration of ad√©lie penguins . " we 're not going to be surprised to see what we 're going to do , " seabird tells the guardian .
