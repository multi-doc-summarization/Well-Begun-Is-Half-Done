ibrahim and i played cards together , we laughed and joked , " it 's shocking , especially when it 's people you 've hung out with . " that 's what the telegraph calls a " profane and pleasures of european cities , " as the washington post puts it . " i would have a drink and he would do n't worry about playing . i used to play cards with salah too , he was often at the cafe , " says 25-year-old nabil abdeslam , who has been on the run since 2012 . " he used to go to parties , he would drink alcohol , smoke . " the post notes that abdeslam 's brother , salah , has been charged with smoking dope in the past two years , and he 's been in charge of the crime , which is why he 's not a suspect in the hunt for a crime . " i 'm not going to be here today , " he says , adding that he 's " very generous " with the government . " he 's a guy who 's been trying to get people 's attention . he 's going to do it . "
