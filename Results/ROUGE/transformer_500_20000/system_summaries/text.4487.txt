a british study has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's , reports the guardian . researchers at the university of leicester say they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases . the study , published in the journal science translational medicine , found that mice with creutzfeldt-jakob disease ( cjd ) are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause . " it 's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease , " says the lead researcher . " the fact that this process should only be restricted to mice , " he says . the study found that the prion disease caused by abnormal proteins was induced in the brains of mice and brains , but it 's not clear if the onset of the protein , or whether it 's a compound that can cause brain damage . " this research , targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins , is folded the wrong way , " the researchers write . the study also points to a growing number of brain diseases , including alzheimer 's , dementia , impaired reflexes , and memory loss .
