it 's a big day for california 's attorney general , and it looks like it 's going to be a big one . the san francisco—california secession can begin collecting signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot and gains by a majority of voters , according to the new york times , which calls it " a “ donor state . " if the measure gets on , it wo n't require an amendment to the california constitution , which is the " supreme law of the land . " the state attorney general 's office , however , is n't sure if it 's the first time the state has voted in the us , and the state is an " inseparable part of the united states " and " the us constitution is the supreme court of america . " the washington post points out that california 's size and wealth ( its gdp is similar to that of france ) make it the one state that might make a go of it alone . the post sees it as a " calexit initiative , " and it notes that it 's " drifting ever-further away from the rest of the country in cultural attitudes and public policies .
