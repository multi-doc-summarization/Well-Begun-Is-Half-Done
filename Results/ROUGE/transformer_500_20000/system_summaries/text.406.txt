the retired marietta officer who has been fighting to keep his k-9 partner on the force so he can keep his dog ajax . matthew hickey , retired from the marietta city council on thursday , is the city council 's auxiliary officer , cnn reports . mayor joe matthews says he plans to take an auxiliary position on ajax . " he 's one of my children , " hickey tells cnn . " he is a family member . " hickey says ajax is valued between $ 3,500 and $ 4,000 . ajax is n't available for another five or six years . the city 's council will decide on thursday if hickey 'll be treated as city property and sold at auction if its handler leaves the force and another handler . ajax can likely be donated to a gofundme page to raise money to the working dog . the gofundme page has raised more than $ 50,000 to go to the family and hopes to make it easier to get the dog to auction off the german shepherd . " we have a lot of money , and we have to do it , " matthews tells the ohio law center . " we are going to make a big mistake . "
