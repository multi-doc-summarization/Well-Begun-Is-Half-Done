" we will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product , " he said in a statement . nelson died in 2015 about four months before her case went to trial in st. louis circuit court . the appeals court ruled that missouri was not the proper jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit filed by jacqueline fox , 62 , of birmingham , who claimed the baby powder she used for about 25 years contributed to her cancer . the case involved suits against squibb over the blood-thinning medication plavix . more than 1,000 others have filed similar lawsuits against johnson & <unk> , which is based in brunswick , new jersey .
