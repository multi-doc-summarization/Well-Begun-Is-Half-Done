earthquakes on the san jacinto fault potentially rival those in the san andreas fault have been a lot more complicated than that , according to san diego state university . " a magnitude 7.5 was generally accepted to be the largest earthquake that would like occur on the fault , " says tom rockwell , an sdsu seismologist at the study 's leader . " we have shown that the central and northern sections of the fault appear to have happened in the past couple of thousand years . the take home here is that earthquakes on <unk> potentially rival <unk> , and it could approach a magnitude 8.0 , although we do n't see evidence that has happened . " the two faults are responsible for roughly 80 % of the seismic surrounding fault over the past 4,000 years , reports the los angeles times , which notes that scientists have been trying to figure out how to deal with it . the san bernardino orioles , meanwhile , has been hit with a huge blast in the city of <unk> , which is expected to climb to the height of the quake at the end of next year . the san jacinto <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
