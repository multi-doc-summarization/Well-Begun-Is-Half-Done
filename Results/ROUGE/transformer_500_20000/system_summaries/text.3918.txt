ted kaczynski , the infamous unabomber , and charles manson , has launched a new billboard with an essay in the new york times . it 's a " almost perfect illustration of what has happened to the " right , " writes lucy jones at the daily beast . " but let 's start with : " as there 's simply no need to finesse it further : billboards in chicago paid by the heartland institute point out that some of the world 's most notorious criminals say they " still believe in global warming . " the billboard features ted kaczynski and james lee as a tyrant , and fidel castro , who may appear on future billboards such as osama bin laden . " what on earth were they thinking ? " he wonders . " the rogues and villains were chosen because they made public statements about how man-made global warming is a crisis and how mankind must take immediate and drastic actions to stop it . " it 's not the first time the billboard has run from may 5 through its conference on may 23 , but it 's " not the only one of the most ill-judged poster campaigns in the history of climate change .
