pregnant women who took acetaminophen , sold under the name " hyperkinetic disorder , " were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder than in their children , according to a new report from the medical journal jama pediatrics . the study found that women who received a diagnosis of a severe form of adhd and similar disorders were diagnosed with hkd or being prescribed adhd , reports the los angeles times . " if i were a woman who was pregnant ... i would try to avoid taking painkillers as much as i can until we know more about it , " says dr. beate ritz , an epidemiologist at the university of california los angeles . the study , however , suggests that pregnant women must never take the pills to reduce a fever to treat flu symptoms . " it 's important to note that adhd-like behaviors are not the same as having adhd , " she says . " you should just avoid chronic or long-term consequences . " she adds that the study 's findings may be based on how many prescriptions for adhd are written and how it works .
