" wearing a black and shackles , she only spoke to tell the judge that she is competent to proceed , " he said . " she 's clearly intelligent but has trouble making decisions when she 's bombarded with information . " cotton , a mental illness , was ruled in august to be unable to understand the charges or aid in her own defense , but it was n't clear whether she was competent . psychologists anthony jurek , an assistant district attorney , argued that the girl was highly capable of turning down a plea bargain , and that she had no chance of succeeding at all .
