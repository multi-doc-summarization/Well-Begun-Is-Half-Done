the republican national committee has pulled out of an advertising deal with donald trump 's campaign for $ 1.3 million , reports the hill . the move comes after buzzfeed founder jonah peretti explained that in april , the rnc and buzzfeed signed an agreement to " spend a significant amount on political advertisements slated to run during the fall election cycle . " but since trump became the nominee his campaign has proven themselves to be " directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees , " the source says . " we certainly do n't like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company . " the rnc says it has terminated the deal with the rnc , though it says it is n't clear whether it will take effect until 2018 . buzzfeed notes that the site 's employees are n't aware of trump 's rhetoric . " in general , we have taken the position that we won â€™ t take ads for his presidential campaign and that we would be terminating our agreement with them , " peretti said in a statement . " we will not accept trump ads for the same reason . "
