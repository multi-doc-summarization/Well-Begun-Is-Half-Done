shinichi mochizuki mochizuki of kyoto university has become one of the most popular mathematicians in the world . the abc news reports his fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work . mochizuki , who posted a new report in 2012 , says he has n't been able to give a definitive answer on whether it is correct . " it 's a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it 's right or wrong , " he tells the japan times . he says he plans to use the abc conjecture to make it easier for him to find an error , but he says it will take a few more years to be fully confirmed . the report says mochizuki , a university of oxford , has been diagnosed with his help in the past , but it 's not clear whether he 'll be able to get it back . the report is based on mochizuki 's disappearance , and the researchers hope to find him in the meantime . " i do n't think he has anything to do with it , " says mochizuki . " i think he 's going to do it . "
