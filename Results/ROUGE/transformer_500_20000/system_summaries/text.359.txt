madonna has lost a legal battle to prevent the auction of personal items including a lock of her hair , underwear and a breakup letter from former boyfriend darlene lutz , the new york daily news reports . according to nbc news , the singer filed a temporary restraining order against new york auction house monday , claiming the items were originally up for bid last year . according to reuters , madonna said she was not aware until reading press reports that she had misdirected her own assistants . in a decision made public yesterday , judge gerald lebovits ruled that lutz " does not obviate my right to maintain my privacy , including with regard to highly personal items� ? " she said . " for you to be seen with a black man wouldn ’ t in any way jeopardize your career , if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting . " lutz 's lawyer says the letter is " absurd , " but it 's not clear if madonna will be able to make amends with madonna 's alleged role in tupac shakur 's death . the letter also criticizes lutz 's attorney 's office as " an extraordinary man who wrongfully convicted of sexual assault .
