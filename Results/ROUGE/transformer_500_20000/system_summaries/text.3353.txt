" oxytocin , sometimes referred to as the â€˜ love hormone , is one powerful chemical : during physical intimacy , it increases for both men and women ; it acts as a major deficit in autism . " this is the first study that looked at whether oxytocin has an effect on social behavior , which has also shown that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain function better , " sirigu says . the study also found that people who are autistic often prone to interacting in social situations tend to get better in a ball tossing game .
