if someone were to drill a hole all the way through the planet , it would take them to arrive on the other side , according to a new american journal of physics . the american association of physics teachers says the new answer is 42 minutes off that estimate . " this is the kind of paper we love , " david jackson , a physicist at dickinson college in pennsylvania , tells phys.org . the new calculation helps explain why you can replace one simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer . klotz says no and the math to prove it , but it 's not all bad news for armchair astronomers . the study found that the time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer independent of distance but interpolates between 42 min for a planet with uniform . the researchers say they 've figured out how to fall into it , and they hope to make it easier for the rest of the planet to get the answer to 42 minutes . the study , published in the march issue , says that while the study is based on data from the <unk> , " it 's really exciting that the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of the earth , and then somehow manage to take them into it . that 's what makes abstract gravity easier .
