effigies of black lynching found hanging on a northern california campus saturday morning has sparked debate over whether the images are powerful art or just plain tasteless , the ap reports . according to usa today , the photographic images were found in a tree near bancroft lane , cal biology student eniola abioye , and amy hamaoui , who were found hanging from the arches at the campus of the university of california . " it 's unclear if this is racially motivated effort or an effort at something else , " campus spokeswoman claire holmes said in a statement . the effigies , which had been feuding with the black student union , says it was " irresponsible " and " insensitive " to the african-american community . " i do n't know who hanged the images or the motivation for the destruction of the campus , but i 'm not going to be surprised to see them . " the ap notes it 's not clear if the effigies were placed by people supporting the protests , but it 's also unclear if the cardboard will coincide with a national protest against police brutality .
