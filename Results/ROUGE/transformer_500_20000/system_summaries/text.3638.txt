" the most beautiful paintings are those one dreams of while smoking a pipe in one 's bed , " he says . " it was there that he conceived some of his finest works.gauguin arrived a month after the beds but his stay was abruptly curtailed . " van gogh , who had been living in provence for more than a century , had spent the day working together by continuous rain , gauguin would leave theo alone in the yellow house for 150 months . the study found that van gogh was distressed by news of the 1888 death of the guest , who was about to marry him in the second world war ii , the telegraph reports . van gogh biographer walter van gogh tells the new york daily news the procedure is a " nightmarish " and " brazen " attempt to get a glimpse of his personal life in the hands of the artist and his family . he says he plans to cut off his ear and support for his family , but he says it has n't been seen since .
