the new jersey department of banking and insurance has filed a lawsuit against the state law against their sexual orientation . " it 's completely discriminatory . it gets us furious every time , because good people come in , and they say we just wanted to have a family and get on with our lives , and do what we have to do , " says dr. jane miller , a lawyer for the plaintiffs . " we have a medical diagnosis of infertility , and we were denied the medical treatments any heterosexual couple would have if they walked into a fertility clinic . " the plaintiffs , who are seeking damages for artificial insemination , say the mandate discriminates against their efforts to try to become pregnant , reports the wall street journal . " the women are already going through what can be a difficult experience and they have the added stress of affording it financially and the added insult of being treated like a second-class citizen , " miller says in a statement . the plaintiffs say that while the law does n't apply to clients , the state 's statute of limitations has n't been enforced , but it 's not clear whether the lawsuit is motivated by the law , the journal notes .
