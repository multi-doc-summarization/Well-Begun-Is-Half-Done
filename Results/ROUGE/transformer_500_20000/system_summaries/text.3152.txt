canada 's national police force has permitted its women to wear the hijab instead of the usual mountie headgear . the commissioner of the royal canadian mounted police association tells the ap it is intended to better reflect the diversity of canada and to encourage more muslim women to consider a career with the force . the mounties faced a public backlash more than 25 years ago when a sikh man took the government to court and won the right to wear his turban , a veil that covers the head and chest . canadians have long since accepted the change . the change is expected to be seen in 2010 by the scottish police association , which has been criticized for its discriminatory change in policy , reports the ap . " the formal announcement was welcomed by the government this week , " says public safety minister ralph goodale 's spokesman . " we serve as a representative of our community . " bardsley , who has been nicknamed " america 's most beautiful " and has been a vocal critic of the government , says it 's working to make the change . " we are not going to tolerate discrimination , but we do n't want to be intimidated , " he says .
