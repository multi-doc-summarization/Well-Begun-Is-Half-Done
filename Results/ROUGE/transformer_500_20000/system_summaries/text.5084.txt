secretary of state mike pompeo met with north korea on friday , and he did n't seem to mind that . in a speech at the united nations general assembly , pompeo said the us would " fill in " details on how to dismantle the north 's nuclear program , the new york times reports . " we are not going to make a big deal , " he said . " it 's going to happen . " the washington post notes that the word " dotard " is reminiscent of a low point in relations between north korea and donald trump , and it 's not clear whether the us will follow through on the pledges . the guardian notes that trump , who met with kim yong chol in pyongyang in september , has been speaking out about the denuclearization of the us and the us , which has been ratcheting up sanctions for the north , is a " mentally deranged us dotard , " with the us agreeing to deliver a cd of elton john 's " rocket man " to the north korean regime . the guardian reports that the speech was " inevitable , " though it did n't go far enough to appease the president , who has been criticized by the us since the us was in the midst of a war of war with iran . the times notes that pompeo and his allies have been feuding over the last few months , with some calling it " more bizarre " and " alarming .
