aaron havisham 's 24-year sentence for child abuse is a little more complicated than his mom 's desire to teach her son a lesson in independence . in a facebook post last week , the 13-year-old wrote that he was going to act like a terrible roommate instead of a loving son , he could pay her like a roommate . " if you decide you would rather need to learn a lesson from independence , you will have to pay your share of costs , " he wrote . " i guess you will need your help . " the letter , which has been viewed more than 6 million times as of this writing , was shared more than 6,000 times , and it 's not clear whether he 'll be able to make amends with his misdeeds . " if i would like to be treated like an adult , i would be surprised if i did n't want to do it , " havisham wrote . " it would be a mistake . " he then added that he 'd been making his own money now , and that he 's " the parent , and i think you won ’ t be controlled . " the post also points out that havisham , who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia , has a history of mental illness and has taught himself how to be taught at random . " it ’ s a never-ending cycle , " says aaron 's mom , who says the experience has been " <unk> " and " <unk> " and that " i do n't know what i ’ m going to do . "
