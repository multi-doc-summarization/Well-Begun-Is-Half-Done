researchers have discovered a large reservoir of liquid water that sits under the greenland ice sheet all year . the aquifer covers more than 100 billion square miles below the surface of greenland , reports the bbc , which notes that the snow is stored in the air space between the particles of ice and particles . " we thought we had an understanding of how things work in greenland , but here is this entire storage system of water we did n't realize was there , " says study author richard forster of the university of utah . it 's not clear what caused the water to melt , but the researchers say it 's possible that the aquifer in the area is responsible for a rise in sea levels over the past 100 years . the water is expected to be fully analyzed in the snow , but researchers say the accelerated ice sheet will help scientists better understand the fate of greenland 's annual surface melt . " it 's going to be very hard to imagine if it 's a good idea , " one researcher tells the bbc . " it is a very dangerous situation . "
