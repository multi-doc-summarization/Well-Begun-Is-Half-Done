rosé is great with fish ! and strawberries ! and it 's summer , at least according to kristi coulter , who has been sober for more than a single glass of wine with dinner , the new york daily news reports . " i see that booze is the oil in our motors , the thing that keeps us purring when we do end up having more than <unk> glass of <unk> , make sure i ’ m seen by the five people who care about these things , and leave before things get sloppy ( which they always do ) . but this morning was different . when i felt the twinge of a hangover , i immediately thought of an essay that i — and , judging by facebook and twitter , almost every woman i know recently . " the wines and four beers are on display at the catering stand . " it is not an option . my plan is to work the room with my soda and get a blank look at it , i don ’ t beat myself up about it , " she writes in the post .
