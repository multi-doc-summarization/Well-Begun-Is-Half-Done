historians have put online what they say is the most complete list of nazi ss commanders and guards at the auschwitz concentration camp in hopes of them can still be brought to justice . the state-run institute of remembrance said monday that the ss kl garrison list is based on data from archives in poland , germany , the united states and to a limited extent , the ap reports . historians estimate that some 12 % of auschwitz guards were tried by courts in poland and elsewhere . the list is not complete and his search continues , and historians say the work of historian aleksander lasik , who has been training for more than 30 years of archival research . " the world justice system has failed and i 'm doing what a historian should do : expose the responsible individuals as war criminals , " lasik told the ap in a statement . the online list contains more than 25,000 names , including english and german , and lasik , which has been built during wwii . the ap notes that the number of guards at german death camp could still be living , but it 's not clear how long it will be , but the ap points out that it 's the first time the ss has been operated in poland since wwii .
