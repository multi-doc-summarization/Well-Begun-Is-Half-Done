apple has changed its mind on marijuana , and now it 's asking people to talk about the plant in ways most people do n't feel comfortable on other social apps . in a letter to apple , the company says it has banned a game called weed firm , which will grace its digital store , reports mashable . " a tremendous amount of responsibility has just been placed on massroots ; we have a duty to show the world that cannabis consumption can be done in a safe place , " says the company 's ceo . it 's not clear whether apple will use it , but it says it 's " notoriously arbitrary " and that it 's unfair to assume that the app is unpredictable and unfair , and it 's a violation of the law . the company is n't commenting on the specifics of the app , which is based on its own website . " we 're a social network for cannabis that enables people to grow and sell it to their homes and drive them out of the business , and they 're not going to get it done , " apple says in a blog post .
