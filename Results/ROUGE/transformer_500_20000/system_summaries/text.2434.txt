the tribeca film festival has come under fire for its screening of a documentary that promotes the anti-vaccination movement . robert de niro defended the screening of vaxxed : " i love you but you made a very serious mistake . on monday , the widely discredited and dangerous anti-vaccination andrew wakefield , the co-founder of vaxxed , " wrote in a statement , per the new york times . it 's not the first time he has expressed a preference for autism and has been given a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined , " he wrote . " the privilege of putting everyone at risk if you 're doing well enough , your bad decisions will probably only only hurt someone else . " wakefield , who wrote about the festival 's decision , says it 's " very personal to me and my family and i want there to be a discussion about what happened and what happened to them . " he says that while the film is n't discredited , it 's a matter of time for the film to be shown at the festival . " it ’ s not clear what it was going to be , but it doesn ’ t make it morally <unk> , " de niro says , adding that he 's " not a fan of any kind " of " <unk> " and " <unk> " to " <unk> people " who are " <unk> , " and that " i have a lot of people who are sick . " the guardian notes de niro , who has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2015
