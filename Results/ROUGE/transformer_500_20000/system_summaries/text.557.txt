scientists have found a way to erupt from undersea deposits of methane , known as gas hydrates , and it 's not the first time the craters in the world have ever seen . in a study published tuesday in america 's first pulp magazine , researchers say the craters are up to half a mile wide and 150ft deep and appear to have been caused by gas leaking from deposits in the sea floor , reports the new york times . the gases are thought to be solid under the enormous pressures found in the swamps and mines , but the bermuda triangle is an area of the western north atlantic , reports usa today . researchers say that in 1964 , the gas blasts could explain why the bermuda age is 52 years old . " it 's a really big deal , " says a researcher at the university of australia . " we 're not going to say what 's going to happen . " the report , which calls the discovery a " wave of speculation , " is based on a number of mysterious craters in siberia and across the coast of norway , including 186 new york city , the guardian reports . the researchers say they 've found craters on the sea bed in the western part of the ocean , which has long been controversial in astronomy circles for more than a decade . " we have no idea how to explain this , but it 's possible to find a geological perspective , " researcher rolf <unk> tells the guardian . " it â€™ s a very promising idea . " ( the pacific tsunami may also be in danger . )
