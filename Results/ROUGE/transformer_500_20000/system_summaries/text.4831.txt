a massachusetts marine biologist has been bitten by a great white shark while trying to figure out how he was killed , the ap reports . " someone told me they ca n't come close to the edge , but i do n't believe that anymore , so i 'm just staying out , " he says . " the sightings are n't the first of the summer . " the carcass is below the high tide level , and officials hope the tide drags on . " there 's really no means to move an animal of that size , " says a state biologist . the shark was found in westport , mass. , on saturday , and police say it was n't able to stop the shark from spreading the shark 's body . the shark appeared to have washed up near the rhode island state line from little compton and was found no signs of trauma . the shark , whose cause of death has not been determined , has been drawn into the cape cod beaches since july .
