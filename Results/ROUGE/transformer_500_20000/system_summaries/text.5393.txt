donald trump says he " could have signaled support for iraq " during a 2002 interview with howard stern this week . " when we do n't , we have the worst of all worlds : iraq remains a threat to build nuclear weapons , " trump said , per cnn . " i 'm no politician . but if you look at 2003 , there are articles . " he also called the interview a " world-class businessperson . i built a great company , i employed thousands of people . so i 'm not a politician . so people did n't write everything i said . i do n't know why he went in " to iraq . " " i would probably say that something was going on , " he said . " i was , as they say , <unk> . ' you know , i wish the first time it was done correctly . " trump , who has repeatedly claimed that he was against the iraq war before it began , " was n't a politician , " the washington post reports . " but the fact is , if we decide a strike against iraq is necessary , it is madness to carry the material to its conclusion . "
