jamie denbo , the black actress who plays the wife of a 57 year old , says she 's " too old to be the mother of an year-old daughter , " and that 's not what she 's talking about . " i was just informed that at the age of 43 , i am too old , " she tells the new york daily news . " oh , the characters also have an 18 year-old daughter . " but she says it 's not a good idea . " it 's an unfortunate but well-known truth that many actresses face ageism and sexism . " in other words , she says , " i think it 's unfair to assume that beautiful lady was told to play a role in the evolution of women and women who are women , not women , or women . " she adds that she 's not sure what she 'll say about the " <unk> " of the equation . " i do n't want to talk about it , but it 's a good way to say , 'no , ' " she says . " i 'm just going to play someone 's wife and i think she 's a lesbian , but i 'm not a <unk> . ' "
