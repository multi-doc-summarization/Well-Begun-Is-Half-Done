ridley scott 's second installment in the 'alien ' prequel . critics are divided on whether the film 's personal invasion , but critics are split . here 's what they 're saying : " after the alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks ( not for the first time ) with the last entry , prometheus , five years ago , old master ridley scott has resuscitated it , and then some , with alien series , " writes rex reed at the new york times . it 's " the horrific bugger yet . " the film " ranks among the better chapters of a sci-fi horror franchise that began with the first two . " the movie " looked as the <unk> , choosing instead to batter with dialogue and events that seemed to betray basic elements . " but the film is n't so great , writes roger ebert at the chicago sun-times . " it â€™ s the horrific fear of <unk> , " he writes at the toronto star . the movie is a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and chock full of dazzling <unk> . " but it 's not the first film to be seen in the director 's <unk> . " it 's an eminently enjoyable movie , but it feels a lot more <unk> than the original . "
