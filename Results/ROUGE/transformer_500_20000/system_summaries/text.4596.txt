scientists have found a correlation between brain size and the brain size of the brain , and it 's not clear whether it 's a causal link between brain volume and iq , but researchers at the universities of vienna are reporting in the journal philosophical transactions . the study , published in plos one , calls it " the best way we can measure someone 's ability to rationally understand the world around them , as well as their memory , reasoning , and logic skills . " the researchers found that even though the brain volume drops slightly , it 's the " structure of your brain that seems play a larger role in determining how makes people more or less 'intelligent ' than their peers , " the study 's lead author says . the study found that the study was based on data from more than 8,000 participants over the course of 150 years , and that the researchers did n't find any evidence for a causal role . " there is undoubtedly a connection between the absolute majority of iq groups , " researcher <unk> <unk> says in a press release . he says the study shows that the brain 's iq is more important than the average iq of iq , which has been linked to cognitive decline , the guardian reports . the study also points to a " very strong correlation " of brain imaging , which could help scientists try to make sense of what they say . the study is based on a number of studies involving 148 people , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
