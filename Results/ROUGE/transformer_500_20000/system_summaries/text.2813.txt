when diana carrillo , her sister and two friends decided to try the saint marc pub-cafe in pacific city last week , they were hoping for a nice shared experience on social media , the new york daily news reports . " this type of behavior is not representative of the st. marc brand and will not be tolerated , " she says . " i feel that 's the direction we 're headed in , given who ’ s the president , " carrillo says . carrillo says he fired the waiter and asked him to make sure you ’ re residents before i serve . " he says the four women were seated in the restaurant , and the manager of the restaurant told him they had a " shared experience " but did n't follow corporate policy by any stretch of the imagination . " the individual was a very different person , " berden tells kmov . " that ’ s one of the reasons i posted it on facebook rather than just dealing with the restaurant. ” the restaurant says it 's investigating the restaurant 's actions , but it 's not clear whether it will be rescheduled or if it 's rescheduled to friday .
