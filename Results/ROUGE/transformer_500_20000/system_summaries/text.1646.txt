the new york museum has apologized for its " fire in my belly , a work in progress , " cnn reports . david wojnarowicz , who died in 1992 , was banned from a smithsonian museum in new york after suffering from aids . " i think that in the artistic community , curators are tremendously insensitive to christians , they respond by claiming victim status and i find it appalling , " she said in a statement . " someone who did n't see it , called it in , put pressure and they pulled it . if you pull one piece how do you know another would n't be pulled . that 's censorship . " the video , which has been viewed 30 minutes long and includes graphic sexual content and nudity , is viewed free of charge . " we can not afford to take hard won civil liberties for granted and need to remain vigilant and protect artistic freedom , " says museum director lisa phillips . " you ca n't even make fun of the holocaust , you ca â€™ t even depict anything about mohammed . " the museum says it has always defended freedom of expression and continues to oppose censorship .
