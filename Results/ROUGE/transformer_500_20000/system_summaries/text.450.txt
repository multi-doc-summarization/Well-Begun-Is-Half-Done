albert lin is hunting for genghis khan , the ruthless conqueror who was buried in an unmarked tomb in mongolia in 800 years , reports the new york times . the explorer and research scientist at the university of california at san diego has more than 7,000 square miles of largely uncharted , rural territory , which makes lin ' mission an extremely challenging one . " what a computer can ’ t do is look for ‘ weird things , ’ but when you ask a human brain , you don ’ t have to tell it what ‘ weird ’ is ; we know , ” lin says . “ those weird things could be important archaeological finds . " lin , who has it that , says he hopes to find out how to look for particular objects and tag them as “ other ” if they see something peculiar , “ this is the sort of vague judgment that humans can perform , ” he says . lin , the first emperor of the mongol empire , has been in mongolia inspecting the places that had been tagged by the online volunteers . “ we ’ d literally jump on , and it ’ s not going to happen again , " he tells the times . “ it 's a huge loss . ”
