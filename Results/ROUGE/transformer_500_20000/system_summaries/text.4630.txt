fbi director james comey says hillary clinton should not face criminal charges after a review of new emails from clinton campaign manager john podesta . " based on our review , we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july , " comey said in a letter to congressional leaders sunday , per the washington post . the fbi says the fbi was rekindling its investigation into clinton 's email server and that it was all a distraction to take away focus from the wikileaks and that comey was reopening the case into hillary clinton 's emails . the fbi is investigating whether the emails were obtained by the fbi and the fbi , but it 's not clear whether they were involved in the investigation . comey says he has n't spoken to clinton since the 2016 election , but he says he 's " going to make everybody think for the next three or four days that there 's really something to possibly know . " he says that while the investigation is underway , " it will be very difficult to tell the truth about what happened . " the new york times reports that comey has said he has no recollection of the emails and has no plans to testify before congress . the times notes that in a statement released friday , comey said the fbi had discovered emails in a private email server that contained " no evidence " of weiner being fired from the fbi .
