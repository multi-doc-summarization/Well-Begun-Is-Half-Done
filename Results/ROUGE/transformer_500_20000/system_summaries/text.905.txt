george lucas has apologized for criticizing disney 's handling of " star wars : the force awakens " in 2012 , the ap reports . " it 's not clear what he meant , and rose did n't ask a follow-up question on his pbs show that aired dec. 24 , 2015 , when he was 11 years old , when i first wanted to be an actor . we went to an agent and they wanted to change my name to lenny williams , " lucas wrote in a letter to charlie rose . " that 's not cool ... not really . they felt my name was too ethnic and i wouldn â€™ t get as many jobs . so that thwarted me from being an actor for a number of years . i tried again two years later when i was 13 and got an agent to accept me with my name . you earned an oscar nomination soon after . how does that feel when you 're 19 ? " lucas , who created the " white slavers " saga , says he 's " a very very inappropriate analogy . " he says he has no plans to make the movie public , though he says it 's " very hard thing to do . " lucas is n't the only one who 's in the running for the movie , which he says is " somewhat surprising . "
