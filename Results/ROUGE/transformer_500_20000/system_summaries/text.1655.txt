paul ryan is n't the only candidate running for president , but he 's got a lot of attention . in a fox news sunday interview , ryan said he 's " the co-chair of the united states , " adding that " cruz is doing pretty well . he 's pulling ahead in polls. ‚Äù the washington post points out that ryan 's victory would make an open convention more likely , and the new york times characterizes it as a " extreme hypothetical , " as politico puts it . ryan also spoke about the possibility of a contested convention in wisconsin , where he said he 'd vote for president trump 's 2012 ticket . in other words , he said , " i do n't think it 's going to happen again , and that 's what we 're going to do with it . we 're not going to be able to do it . we 'll have to make it happen . we 'll be going to have to be the party 's nominee , and we 'll find ourselves in the hands of the democratic party . " he also called the rnc a " <unk> " and said it was " lots of reasons " that were n't a " <unk> " or " <unk> . " the post notes ryan 's comments are " eerily consistent with the fact that the republican party has a strong chance of winning the nomination . "
