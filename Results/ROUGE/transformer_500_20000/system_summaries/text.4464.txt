gap inc. on monday announced it will drop a new version of its logo after thousands of facebook users called for a return to the classic blue box , cnn reports . " it reminds me of the old microsoft free clip-art galleries , " one facebook user wrote . " i ca n't believe this is happening . " the new logo , featuring a white background and a small blue square in the top right corner , has been used for more than 20 years and has been viewed as a complement to activism but could not replace action . " we 've heard loud and clear that you do n't know why it matters , but it does , " the company said in a statement . " we only want what 's best for the brand and our customers . " cnn notes that the logo , which the new york times calls " a far more sensible response to gladwell â€™ s logo , " has gone back on plans to revamp its logo thanks to pressure from twitter and facebook . " it totally looks like a salad cream-style publicity stunt , " a facebook rep says .
