the president of the world 's largest economies , drawing the ire of both democratic and republican lawmakers and further tensions over russia 's meddling in the 2016 election , has been reinstated into the group of industrialized nations , the ap reports . " russia should be in this meeting , " trump told reporters upon leaving the white house for the summit . " why are we having a meeting without russia being in the meeting ? " he added . " they should let russia come back in , because we should have russia at the negotiating table . " trump 's statement is an extraordinary break from key us allies , and particularly striking given russia 's ties to the g8 in 2014 after the majority of member countries allied against russia 's annexation of crimea , which russia continues to hold . trump , who is expected to meet with north korean leader mahmoud abbas on friday , says he plans to visit singapore to the g7 summit next week . " now , i love our country . i have been russia 's worst nightmare , " he says . " but with that being said , russia should have be a part of it . " the ap notes that trump has repeatedly denied the allegations .
