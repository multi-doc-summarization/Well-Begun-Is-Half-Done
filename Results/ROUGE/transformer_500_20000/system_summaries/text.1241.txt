amazonian shamans have been known as the " spirit vine " for centuries , but it 's not the first time a new study has been published in the brazilian review of psychiatry . researchers at university of sao paulo in brazil say they 've published their work in the journal revista de psiquiatria to treat depression as a treatment for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , reports the guardian . the researchers say the ayahuasca is made from a vine and shrub leaves and contains the chemical dimethyltryptamine , which makes it illegal in most countries ( though many allow its consumption for religious purposes ) . the study found that consuming the brew is notoriously hard on the system , resulting in excessive depression and anxiety , reports live science . researchers say that after the ayahuasca treatment began , the researchers found that the tea was resistant to at least one type of spirits that had been banned or half a century ago . the ayahuasca review of the psychiatry ayahuasca translation of psychiatry found that people traveling to south america to participate retreats from their retreats , and the results were n't finalized . the researchers say <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
