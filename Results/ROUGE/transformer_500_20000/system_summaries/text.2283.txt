a new york prison is rooting for the two murderers who broke out of an upstate penitentiary in dannemora , ny , on thursday night . timothy vail , 47 , tells the daily news that he plans to stay out of sight and do n't commit any new crimes . " when you commit crimes , the cops are all over you . that 's the mistake we made , " he says . " you 're in a cell 24/7 but the minute you get out there , it 's going to be a lot easier to find . " the pair , who fled the prison in a similar way , were not looking to find food in a trash bin , but they were unable to escape . the guardian reports that the inmates have escaped over the past three decades , and they 've tried different methods , scaling gates , donning or simply walking away when they 're looking . since the escape , the prison would have to be " outlast all the time , " vail says . " it would have been the worst day of my life . " he adds , " i think it 's a very brazen , very dangerous situation . " the guardian notes that the prison has been closed to traffic for a few years .
