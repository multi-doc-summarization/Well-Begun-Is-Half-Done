north korea has lobbed another verbal salvo at an increasingly embattled plan for its leader , kim jong un , and president trump on tuesday , calling vice president mike pence a " political dummy " and saying it is just as ready to meet in a nuclear confrontation as at the negotiating table , the ap reports . " it has neither experienced nor even imagined. " in its most direct language aimed at washington , dc , and new zealand . " we are not going to beg for dialogue and negotiation , " trump said . " we need to be careful about what we are doing , " he added . " we have a lot of things to do . " the bbc notes that the meeting was hastily arranged by the leader of the north 's foreign affairs department , which has said the north would be " stupid , " and the ap characterizes the meeting as a " not-so-subtle rebuke of the president 's own party . " the ap notes that trump 's comments on the summit have been condemned by the us and north korea over the past decade .
