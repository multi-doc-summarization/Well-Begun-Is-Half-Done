" ( being a liberal and a patriot are mutually exclusive ? hillary is causing the protests & hate crimes ? the koran is a political tract . " ) " it is wildly irresponsible for la talk radio to allow a trump to co-host one of their programs , where she can spew her idiotic lies unchecked , " he wrote . " susan olsen spreads outrageous & it is dangerous and unprofessional . a day later , olsen responded on her facebook page , " this is the little piece of human waste .
