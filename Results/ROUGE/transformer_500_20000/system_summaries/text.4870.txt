" the timing is not right for me , but i am hopeful that the people of massachusetts will select someone of great integrity , vision , and compassion as our next us senator . however , i am currently committed to my business and to spending as much time as i can with my wife and children . " romney 's son , tagg , was a visible surrogate for mitt romney 's campaign .
