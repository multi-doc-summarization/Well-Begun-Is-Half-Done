chris christie is expected to announce within days whether he will join the presidential race . the new york times and wall street journal have a look at christie 's inner circle over the weekend , and it reports that he has spent much of it lately with his wife , family , and friends who have talked to him about his intentions on the campaign trail . " i do n't respond to the requests , " he said . " i think it 's a good thing to do . " the new jersey national guard , meanwhile , has a different view of the race , and the wall street , the journal reports . the journal sees a " paradox " of launching an " 11th-hour campaign " of sorts " in the governor 's office , which has been ratcheting up its own firestorm of criticism from both sides of the campaign and the political establishment . the journal has a backgrounder on christie 's campaign , including the possibility of mediation with his aides , and a $ 1 million fine . the journal calls it a " major setback " for christie , who has been in office since his death .
