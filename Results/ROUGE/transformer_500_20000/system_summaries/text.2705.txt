" we 're not going to be able to reverse this , " the lead researcher tells the guardian . " we are going to make a lot of money to rebuild our lives , " he says . " we do n't think it 's going to happen . " the scientists say the extinction rate of extinction for the species has been halved over the past two decades , and they 've also seen a decline in extinction than the lowest estimates of <unk> extinctions in the us , the los angeles times reports . " it 's not the first mass extinction that 's being caused by humanity 's demise , " says a study author . " it â€™ s going to have a lot more to do with this . "
