" ken taylor represented the very best that canada â€™ s foreign service has to offer. " except for those three months in winter of 1979 , taylor wrote in a statement , per the guardian . the canadian government , however , says it has n't been able to look for an exit from the us embassy in kabul , but it 's not clear whether it will take 14 months before they were able to return to the us . " i am convinced we were certainly going to have the six sanctuary and who is now consul general in new york city , " harper says . " we will not be intimidated by the actions of the united states and the government . " the times notes that affleck and his wife , ayatollah ali <unk> , were fed up with the shah 's government , which is supported by affleck , who has been accused of trying to modernize the country 's government . the times points out that in the past 20 years , it 's unclear how many of the six diplomats were killed in the iranian war .
