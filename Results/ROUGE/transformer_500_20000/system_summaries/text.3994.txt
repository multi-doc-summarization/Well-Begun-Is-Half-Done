two public schools in new york city are getting a lot of attention over the summer , and one of them has a new one : the rainbow colors . the rainbow loom in stacks around grade school kids ' arms as they make them trade them , and they 're not yet sure what 's going on , writes bill <unk> at the washington post . it 's not clear whether kids will be under age twelve , but it 's a good example of their own , writes <unk> <unk> at the wall street journal . " the boys in my class have one , " he writes . " they are no longer allowed to wear the rubber bracelets , but they do n't have the same responsibilities as their parents . " the trend is " <unk> , " but the elementary school 's principal attributes it to a " <unk> culture " that teaches kids about the dangers of gender inequality . " it ’ s a <unk> policy , and it doesn ’ t seem to be a <unk> factor , " writes <unk> <unk> . " it is a <unk> policy . "
