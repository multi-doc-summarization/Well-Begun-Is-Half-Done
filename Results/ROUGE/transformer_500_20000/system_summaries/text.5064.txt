a renowned australian scientist who died thursday at a swiss clinic in basel , switzerland , sang a few bars of beethoven 's ninth symphony . " at my age , one wants to be free to choose the death and when the death is the appropriate time , " david goodall tells cnn . " my abilities have been declining over the past year or two , and my eyesight for the past five or six years , and i no longer want to continue life . " goodall told reporters he was " happy to have the chance tomorrow to end it . " the scientist , who wore a shirt that read " disgracefully , " says he has considered using lethal injection , but the scientist who lived in the clinic tells cnn that the disease authorized the practice states that people who help die can not do so for " selfish " reasons . the state 's trek to switzerland last week announced it would defer to doctors on the method . euthanasia is currently banned in australia where the scientist lived , though the state has n't been fully aware of it .
