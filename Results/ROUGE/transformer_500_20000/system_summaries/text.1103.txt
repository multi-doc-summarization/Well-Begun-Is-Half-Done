" as long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust , i 'm fine with that , " he said . " and when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $ 2 billion , " trump added . " and i love all people , rich or poor , but in those particular positions i just don ’ t want a poor person . does that make sense ?
