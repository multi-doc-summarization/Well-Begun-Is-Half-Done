rep. robert e. andrews has written 646 different pieces of legislation , and he 's resigning from congress after 23 years in congress , reports the washington post . the bills are covering a vast number of bills ever passed the house of representatives , and none made it to the president 's desk , reports politico . only four of andrews 's hundreds of bills fail , but none of them passed the senate , so the bill gets a debate , and it 's not clear whether it will be approved by congress . " i 'm just a bill on capitol hill ' is not the way this works , " he said . " but i do n't think it 's going to happen again . " andrews , 56 , says he plans to resign in two weeks , though he cautions that the move is a " very awful " move . " it 's an unfortunate example of how it feels about it and how it is going to be done to make it compulsory . " the post sees the bills as " one of the most awful bills in common . "
