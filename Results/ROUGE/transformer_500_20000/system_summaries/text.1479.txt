susan rice is as competent as anybody that you will find… . " these are code words . we heard them during this recent campaign , we heard calling our president ‘ lazy , ’ these kinds of terms that those of us who were born and raised in the south we ’ ve been hearing these little words and phrases all of our lives and we get insulted by them , " she wrote in a letter to rep. jim clyburn . the letter , which has been widely viewed as having either willfully or incompetently misled the american public in the benghazi attack on our embassy in libya , notes the washington post , which notes that rice has been using the best intelligence to give advice and consent to the administration on nominees . rice , meanwhile , is considering sen. john kerry 's pick to block any rice nomination , other senate republicans have not joined a filibuster pledge . " i do n't like those words . say that she was wrong for doing it , but don ’ t call her incompetent . that is something totally different . a lot of very competent people sometimes make errors , and to call that she did it , i think , 'oh , it certainly caused a big problem with me .
