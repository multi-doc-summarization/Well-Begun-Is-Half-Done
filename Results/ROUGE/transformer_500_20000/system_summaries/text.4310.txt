" we ’ ve been in touch with the master of the vessel , who says they are beset by ice , " says alvin stone , a spokesman for voyage operators . " they are believed to have enough provisions to wait out their rescue . " the ship , which is reinforced against ice and well adapted to the conditions , had been stuck in a ice trek across pack ice in antarctica . the storm was well-timed as those on board were in fine spirits and were enjoying christmas . " we managed to collect a range of samples for three of the science teams on these rarely visited islands , " stone says , adding that the penguin trust is still underway and is expected to be fully restored to the sea . the <unk> , which has been built in new zealand for oceanographic research , says that while the ice edge , the <unk> will remain open to the seafloor until the end of the year .
