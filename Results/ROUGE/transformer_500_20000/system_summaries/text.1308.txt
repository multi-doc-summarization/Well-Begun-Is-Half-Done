women 's political giving and financial power to women 's rights have a new report out of the daily caller , and it 's a milestone for women to lag behind their male counterparts . in the survey , women , money , and politics are consistently less than one-third of all political donations to candidates , according to the washington post . that 's down from 31 % in the 2008 cycle and down from 30 % in 2008 . women , far more than men , see the hard , sausage-making dimension of politics as something they are trying to do . " in fact , women still face significant barriers towards realizing equality in politics and public life , " says sam bennett , a republican at the center for responsive politics . " it â€™ s not a man 's world , " he says . " i do n't think he 's going to be re-elected , but i do think that 's what i think of . " in the end of the year , women are more motivated to want to see changes in their neighborhood and city on a social level than men who are in political giving . in 2010 , women made up 26 % of women 's income rise more than 60 % , while women in political action committees were more likely to participate in a larger group of men .
