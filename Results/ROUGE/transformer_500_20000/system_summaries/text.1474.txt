south korea 's kim yang was elected as interpol 's president on wednesday , edging out a longtime veteran of russia 's security services who had lobbied up until the final hours before the vote against alexander prokopchuk 's attempts to be named the next president of the policing organization . the u.s. and others expressed concern that if russia 's candidate had been elected , that would have led to further abuses of interpol 's red notice system to go after political opponents and fugitive dissidents , the bbc reports . kim 's surprise election was seen as a victory for the white house and its european partners , who were strongly opposed by the us , britain and other european nations . russia has since confirmed that meng , 57 , has been accused of using interpol 's arrest warrant system to target critics of the kremlin . the bbc notes that kim , a former south korean police officer who once served as head of police in gyeonggi , is being investigated for alleged involvement in the disappearance of prokopchuk , who has been serving as acting president since his disappearance in september . interpol 's general assembly says it is " unprecedented pressure and interference , " but it 's not the first time kim has been detained .
