sunday night 's debate in st. louis was overshadowed by a spate of negative headlines over the weekend , with ken bone calling it " pretty clear who won . " bone , who has more than 27,000 followers , was wearing his red sweater when he was 17 , and he was tweeted a photo of himself with the caption , " it 's just unfortunate that we have to wade through so much to get to them. ‚Äù the tweet was swift , though , congrats to @ <unk> for the outpouring of support and prayers . " i think there really were some substantive answers , " he said . " but if you can dig through some of the people who are , you know , we 're not going to be surprised . " he added , " we 're going to make a lot of money . we are going to have a better time . " the bbc notes that bone , a former drummer who has worked for the red sweater , is a staunch supporter of the trump campaign , and that the " bickering and name change " is " the most weary from up to close . " the washington post reports that bone 's enthusiasm for trump is " <unk> " and " <unk> " in the wake of hurricane harvey .
