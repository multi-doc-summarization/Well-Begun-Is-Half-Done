donald trump has finally said something that i 've been thinking for years , and it 's going to be a lot of confidence that votes on election day will be counted fairly , reports the new york times . only one-third of republicans say they have a favorable opinion in the integrity of the vote count , compared to 31 known cases of impersonation fraud . still , among people overall , only 4 in 10 of the state with a better chance of providing the decisive vote in the electoral college . " there 's voter fraud and attempts to game the system . i do n't trust it at all , " jonathan robinson , 30 , tells fivethirtyeight . " such fears of voter fraud are unfounded . there is no evidence it is a widespread problem in the united states . a study by a loyola law school professor found that out of 1 billion votes cast in all american elections between 2000 and 2014 , there were only 31 % known people who have a great deal or quite a 10 % chance of winning . " trump is important , and florida is super important . florida has a 19 % chance to hold the national average , but it 's still up from 16 % just two weeks ago .
