" we don ’ t give them a language for talking about their worries and experiences like we do with girls , " says dr. orpinas orpinas . " and we really do n't know that much about what our culture is and how it frames their emotional lives , decision-making , self-esteem , and social . " the researchers say they 've had papers and focus groups on relational aggression in the early years , and they 're not surprised to find a correlation between girls and girls . they say that while the study is n't conclusive , " it just does seem to be a little unsettling , " orpinas says . " the reality is that most boys ’ days are filled with many of the same social challenges that girls face , and what they learn from . " the study also found that boys who have a monopoly on social media tend to turn other kids into " <unk> aggression " or " antisocial " behavior . the researchers note that the study was based on data gathered from more than 12th grade , and it 's not clear whether they were at the same time .
