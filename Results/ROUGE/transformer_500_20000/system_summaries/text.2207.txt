oklahoma city 's cities and counties are banned from setting their own minimum wage from the national standard of $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 an hour , the washington post reports . gov . mary fallin says the state 's legislature " would vote in such a way to take the right of the people having the right to vote on whether they want to raise minimum wage . " " we ’ re looking now at the possibility of a constitutional challenge to the law that was signed because we think that it abrogates the people ’ s right to have an initiative , " slane tells the post . " we 're going to explore all options , including the hopes of getting 4,000 signature by the end of april . " the bill , which is expected to establish a citywide minimum wage higher than the current federal requirement of $ <unk> per hour , will be signed into law monday . " of course we 're disappointed that the governor and the republican legislature stood in the way of the minimum wage , " fallin says , per the post . the petition , which has been viewed more than 1.7 million times , says it 's " not an effective way to bring people out of poverty .
