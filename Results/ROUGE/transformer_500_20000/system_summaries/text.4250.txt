scientists have discovered an explanation for the disappearance of star kic 8462852 8462852 , a " catastrophic collision in the star 's asteroid belt ? " that 's what scientists are saying about the discovery of a distant star that has been the focus of speculation and observation for weeks over possible life may have just been solved , the new york times reports . the study , published in nasa 's spitzer space telescope , found that the dimming system caught extraterrestrial intelligence experts ' attention after two weeks of searching for planets in front of suns , was likely surrounded by thousands of comets . the study found that a swarm of comets fanned out from around the world , the guardian reports . " it 's very exciting to see how the star is framing it as an artifact in deep space , " seti says in a release . " there is no reason to believe it . " nasa says it has not detected the star , but it is believed to be the most likely source of the puzzle . the kepler telescope , which was built around the time , has been monitored by the kepler spacecraft for four years . it 's not clear what caused the collision or whether it was a dismemberment . " we have a very strong understanding of what we are piecing together , but we are still analyzing the data of the comets , which are very consistent with the specifications of the kepler team , " an astronomy professor at iowa state university tells the guardian . " we are working to find the final findings . "
