clash of the titans is over , and critics are calling it a " 3d production and tickets priced at $ <unk> , " writes peter howell at the toronto star . it 's " filled with slick , over-used cgi ! the dialogue is terrible ! the characters are cardboard cut-outs ! yes ! welcome to the film , " he writes at the chicago sun-times . " rather , i ’ m talking about the sheer awful quality of the film itself , which is not very high . although not as low as you probably ( and understandably ) fear/expect . " it cost millions to make ! it 's directed by a hack ! " writes manohla dargis at the new york times . the film " was shot in standard format , then gussied up to add a small bit of depth on the screen and considerably more at the boxoffice . a mere handful of shots have a feel of multi-dimensional immersion , " but that number is small in comparison to the 3d transfer of the <unk> film . " clash ” is what happens when a pissed-off rebel who wants to do everything on his own . "
