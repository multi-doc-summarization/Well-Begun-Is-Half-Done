" yesterday i was commenting that i ’ d never had any success against darvish , and the gesture was saying that i wish he would look at me like one of them and maybe he ’ d throw me an easy pitch so i can do something , " gurriel tells usa today . " quite the opposite . i have always had a lot of respect [ for japanese people ] . i 've never had anything against darvish . for me , he 's a native of japan , " he says , per usa today . he adds that he did n't mean it to be offensive at any point , and that he was 1-for-7 in his career against darvish . " at no point did i mean that in an offensive way , " an mlb rep says , adding that he 's not angry about gurriel 's behavior . the houston chronicle notes that the incident took place in the second inning off los angeles 's stadium , with darvish calling it a " insensitive gesture " and a " <unk> gesture " to darvish .
