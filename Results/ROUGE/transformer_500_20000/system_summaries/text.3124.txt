scientists have discovered that under the massive antarctic ice sheets there , geothermal heat flow from below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet above the freezing point of antarctica . in a study published thursday in nature , researchers found sub-ice microbes called archaea , which convert ammonium and methane into energy to survive and grow . " we were able to prove to the world that antarctica is not a dead continent , " researcher brent christner tells the guardian . " it 's a very dangerous situation , but it 's very difficult to imagine . " in the study , the researchers found that microbes in recent years have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process , which is why they are n't so sure where they 're going to die , reports livescience . the study also found that the microbes from the ice sheet are capable of traveling slowly to the surface , and that it 's not clear where they are , but they 're not sure what 's going on . the study is based on data gathered from around the globe and mail , which has a detailed rundown of the paper 's findings .
