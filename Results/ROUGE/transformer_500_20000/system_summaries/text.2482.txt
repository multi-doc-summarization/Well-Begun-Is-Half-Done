uber and lyft are " welcome to stay , " according to mayor steve <unk> . the ride companies have spent $ 8 million to repeal a city ordinance requiring the fingerprint-based criminal checks and launched what turned into the most expensive race in the texas capital 's history , reuters reports . it 's not clear how many of the companies will be able to use a mass transit system that 's far from ideal . " no matter what , the outcome will be mixed , " uber 's manager says . " we have sent you a stand for a long-term path forward . " the company says it will have to keep negotiating with drivers who do n't follow through on fingerprint requirements for drivers who have been given access to their main bargaining chip . the company has n't commented yet on the withdrawal . " the rules passed by city council don ’ t begin to describe how we feel about shutting down operations in austin , texas , " the manager says in a statement . " it ’ s not going to happen to anyone who has a right to do something like that . "
