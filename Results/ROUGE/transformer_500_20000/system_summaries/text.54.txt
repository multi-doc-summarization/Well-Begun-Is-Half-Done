an australian ship which picked up possible " pings " from the black box recorders of a missing malaysia airlines flight has been unable to detect any further signals , the ap reports . angus houston , head of the australian coordinating the search for malaysia airlines jet mh370 , says he plans to pick up two signals consistent with black box locator beacons before the weekend . " if we do n't get any further transmissions , we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom , " he says . " the black boxes in such deep water would be an immensely difficult , if not impossible , task . up to 14 planes and 14 ships are scouring the 30,000-square-mile search zone . " houston says the signals represented the best lead in the search yet , but it 's not clear whether the sub is on board . " once the beacons beacons blink off , locating the black black box in the black sphere , would be <unk> , " says houston rep. seth <unk> of australia 's ocean shield . the search is scheduled to begin thursday . the search will be postponed until tuesday .
