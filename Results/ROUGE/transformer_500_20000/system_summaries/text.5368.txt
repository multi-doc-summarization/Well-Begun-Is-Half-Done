a new study out of the american sociological association suggests that adult dogs are better at empathy than people who have been abused , the guardian reports . researchers surveyed 240 college students and asked them to read one of four versions of a fictional news article about a fictional beating . the study , published in the journal plos one , found that participants had higher levels of empathy for the abused child , puppy and dog than they did for the adult . " contrary to popular thinking , we are not necessarily more disturbed by animal rather than human suffering , " researcher jack levin says . " the fact that adult human crime victims receive less empathy than do child victims , with age being the more important component . " the study found that people with similar leanings were white and hispanic , but the study did n't find any correlation between primates and dogs . the researchers found that the empathy for abused puppies was the result of a " lack of dog ownership " that would be a " life-changing mistake , " reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether the study will be presented this week . ( in other news , researchers say they 've found a link to empathy . )
