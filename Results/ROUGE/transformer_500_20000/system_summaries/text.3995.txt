one of france 's most celebrated chefs , whose restaurant has been honoured with three stars in the michelin guide for almost 20 years , has pleaded to be stripped of the prestigious ranking because of the huge pressure of being judged on every dish he had asked not to feature in the food bible , the guardian reports . " this was a beautiful challenge and a source of great satisfaction ... but there ’ s a huge pressure as a result of our three-star status , which we ’ ve held since 1999 . today , at 46 years old , i want to give a free spirit and without stress , " sébastien bras wrote in a facebook post . he added that he wanted to be allowed to cook excellent food away from the frenzy of star ratings . " today , we want to relieve the pressure of expectations that the three-star rating brings , " he wrote , adding that the move is the first time a french chef has asked to be dropped from the restaurant guide in this way . the french restaurant in laguiole , which runs the acclaimed le suquet restaurant , says it plans to give up the three michelin stars held by his restaurant in the south of france for 10 years .
