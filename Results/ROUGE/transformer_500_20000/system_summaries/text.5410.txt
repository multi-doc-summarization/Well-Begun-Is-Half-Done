" it 's not clear whether the government is aware of any adverse effects of the disease , breast cancer and other illnesses related to heart disease , and coronary heart disease . " 23andme says the company has failed to provide the scientific data necessary to prove it , but it has n't been proven effective yet . " we are not aware of what we are going to do , but we have to do it , and we do n't know what it 's going to happen , " she says . " we 're going to make sure we can not afford it . " 23andme , meanwhile , says the fda 's " genome <unk> " is a " first step in prevention , " and it 's " a very serious issue " that could help people with health care and drug addictions .
