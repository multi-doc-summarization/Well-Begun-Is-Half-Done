mikhail kalashnikov , who died last month at the age of 94 , wrote a lengthy emotional letter to russian orthodox church patriarch kirill izvestia in 2012 . " my spiritual pain is unbearable . i keep having the same unsolved question : if my rifle took away people 's lives , then can it be that i ... am guilty for people 's deaths , even if they were enemies , " kalashnikov wrote , per the bbc . kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed . he said he was suffering " spiritual pain " over the many deaths it caused . the letter published by izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created russia 's most famous weapon . kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles . more than 100 million kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide . the gun brought kalashnikov to the head of the orthodox church , where he was " a slave of god , the designer reproduced , " he wrote , and it 's unclear , how much of this he wrote . kalashnikov , whose funeral was attended by vladimir putin in 1999 , says she believes a priest helped her survive the death of his father , who was killed in a car crash . the bbc notes that kalashnikov 's father , elena , was a vocal critic of the russian government when he was struck by the red army 's dire lack of weapons during his death .
