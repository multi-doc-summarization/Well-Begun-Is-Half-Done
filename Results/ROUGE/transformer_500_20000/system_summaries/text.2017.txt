alisha arnold is the most horrible people in all the interweb land . the minneapolis star tribune reports alisha 's pregnancy ends december 7th , when she was pregnant for a third time . " should we give birth or have an abortion ? " arnold wrote on instagram . " i have had two babies and no abortions and i know pregnancy is a life . but i 'm not going to tell another person what they should believe . one can support every woman 's right to make her own choice while also finding abortion to be an unfortunate and painful choice . just because i think abortion should be legal does n't mean i support it in general . " the poll will influence their decision to decide whether to keep the baby or abort , and the baby 's mother will have two days to make a decision before the 20th week . the arnolds are both 30 and have been married for 10 years , and they 're undecided about whether they should have the baby . " we do n't know what the reason they 're doing this is , it 's a pretty despicable thing to do . "
