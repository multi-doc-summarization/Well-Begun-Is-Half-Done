the connecticut supreme court ruled tuesday that the state can forcibly medicate a man accused of killing a yale doctor . lishan wang , a chinese citizen from beijing who was n't injured , has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder , cbs news reports . the state 's supreme court confirmed that it is substantially likely that wang would be made by the medication , and it is unlikely he will suffer from side effects . the court also found no less-intrusive option exists , and the government can force medication on mentally ill criminal defendants in the rarest cases . the ruling came after a judge ruled him competent and does n't need medication . the ruling was hailed as a rebuke from the supreme court 's decision to violate his constitutional rights to a fair trial and to mental and physical bodily integrity . the decision was rejected in 2003 by a judge in new haven superior court . the ruling upheld the ruling . wang was charged with shooting and killing yale doctor vajindor toor outside toor 's home in branford . he was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for armed robbery .
