mitt romney is " not a time to be talking about the politics associated with what happened , " he told cnbc 's lawrence kudlow . " i still believe that the second amendment is the right course to preserve and defend and do n't believe that new laws are going to make a difference in this type of legislation i like . the idea of one party jamming through something over the objection of the other tends to divide the nation , not make us a more safe and prosperous place . so if there 's common ground , why i 'm always willing to have that kind of a conversation . " romney , who has backed gun control measures in the past , says he signed into law the first state ban on assault weapons . " the law that we signed in massachusetts was a combination of efforts on the part of those that were for additional gun rights and those that opposed gun rights , and they came together and made some changes that provided , i think , a better environment for both , and that 's why both sides came to celebrate the signing of the bill .
