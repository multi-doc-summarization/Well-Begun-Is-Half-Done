the 12 boys and their soccer coach stuck in a cave in thailand have been rescued from a submerged cave in northern thailand , the bbc reports . the seals have started to pump oxygen into the chamber and are expected to start on friday , but rescuers have been blessed with a brief dry spell . the boys and coach , who have been trapped in the cave for 12 days , are too weak to attempt such a physically escape . " it 's going to be catastrophic , " says a member of the thai navy 's interior ministry . " but it 's not going to happen .

" we are going to get to the bottom of it , and we 'll be able to get it back , " a rescue official says . " we 'll have to wait for it . " the boys , their coach , and their coach were rescued monday after nine days of trapped in a thai cave . the guardian notes that while the boys may not be in action due to expected rains , the cave system could be broken down by 40 % in the past few days . the guardian reports <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
