rachel dolezal , the former spokane chapter of the national association for excellence in policy , tells nbc news that she is " not necessarily saying that i can actually prove they are . i mean , the birth certificate is issued a month and a half after i ’ m born . and certainly there were no medical witnesses to my family , " she says . " but i don ’ t know what i can prove . " dolezal , who has served as president of the spokane , wash. , chapter 7 , has been feuding over the last decade . " i do take exception to that because it 's a little more complex than me identifying as black , or answering a question of , ‘ are you black or white ? ' " dolezal says , adding that she was " born in a teepee. " and that she " would not backpedal , and “ i guarantee you she never will , ” she says . she adds that her uncle , who took her to task for her role in the white supremacist movement , has " set off a national debate about the very meaning of racial identity , with some people applauding her .
