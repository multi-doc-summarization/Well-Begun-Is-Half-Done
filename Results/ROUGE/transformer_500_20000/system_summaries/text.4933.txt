the oil spill hit a snag yesterday in florida 's white sand beaches for the first time in two months , reports the los angeles times . adm. thad allen says the 11 men who lost their lives in this tragic accident were the result of the leak , which caused the evacuation of mud and cement into the well , known as the top kill . " i do n't think the issue is whether or not we can make the second cut . it 's about how smooth it can make it , " he says , adding that the cut is not as smooth as engineers would like to put a looser cap on top of the oil spewing out of the gulf , notes the new york times , which notes that the spill will be placed over the next 20 years . " we 're going to have to wait until the end of the day , and we 'll be going to be able to make it . we are going to get it . we 'll get it . we 'll find out if it 's going to happen . "
