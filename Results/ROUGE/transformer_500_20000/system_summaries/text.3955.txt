harvey weinstein is accused of sexual harassment and assault on her by some of my republican friends . in an interview with vogue 's editor , biden says he 's sorry . " i mean , they really went after her . as much as i tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask , " he says . " and my one regret is that i wasn ’ t able to tone down the attacks . " biden , who was just about to be confirmed as a supreme court justice in 1991 , says he has spoken out against alleged harassers . " i voted against clarence thomas . and i insisted the next election — i campaigned for two women on the condition that if they won they would come on the judiciary committee , so there would never be again all men making a judgment on this , " biden says , per the new york daily news . " but ultimately , he wants to do differently if he could go back and redo those anita hill hearings . " the women 's attorney , anita hill , says that after thomas was seated on the court panel , " i did not have the power to gavel them out of order , " she says , adding that she was " overwhelmed " by her remarks and that she 'd been given " an understanding of what happened to me .
