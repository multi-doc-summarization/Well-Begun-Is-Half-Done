" the flip side of that scenario comes when a pitcher actually gets his throw too close to the strike zone and an intrepid batter goes for it . take a look at these classics . " he says he 's " kind of disappointed to see the intentional walk disappear if only because i loved to see it botched every now and then , " he writes . " it ’ s not about the glare of my life , but i don ’ t know what to do with it . " in a post at sb nation , kipnis explores how the rule passes , which is always fun , and how to walk a standing well away from the batter 's box , things can and do occasionally go awry . " the post has video of the walk , which has been viewed more than 7.7 million times , as well as the fact that it will be faster than it will happen to be . the post points out this nugget from the post , which calls it " a relatively small but noteworthy admission of guilt " and a " <unk> error " that would have been " <unk> " to the batter . the post notes that baseball has been known for the past few years , and it 's been viewed as an attempt to deceive speed games .
