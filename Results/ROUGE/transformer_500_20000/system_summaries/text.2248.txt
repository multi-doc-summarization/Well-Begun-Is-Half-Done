bill cosby 's appearance on the late show with david letterman last month has been revealed , and it 's not clear whether he 'll have to deal with it . the new york daily news reports that the lawyer , who has been feuding with the clintons since 2005 , says that after the story broke , he " would include as a request , before he arrived , that the young girls , interns , and assistants , would be allowed to watch him eat curry , " according to a source . " no one would say anything , and he would sit silently eating and make us watch and want us to watch . " the source says the show 's " no comments " were made at the time of the sexual assault , and that cosby " has been cast in a very different direction than any other group of women , " the sources say . green , who is the dad of bill cosby , says the allegations are " absurd " and " untrue , " and adds that " there is a lot of people who do n't know what they 're going to do with them . " in a statement released friday , the show says it will " vigorously investigate " the allegations , but it will take a few days to figure out what happened .
