president trump 's pick to replace anthony kennedy on the supreme court monday was a little more complicated than that . the new york times reports that trump has narrowed his list of seven candidates to just three federal appeals court <unk> brett kavanaugh , raymond kethledge , and amy coney barrett presented the fewest obvious obstacles to being confirmed to conservatives for decades . trump is set to unveil his pick at the white house in prime time monday , and sources tell the wall street journal that trump will not ask candidates about their stance on overturning roe v. wade , though he has n't backed anyone outright , the sources say . " i think it 's going to be a good day for the president , " trump told reporters . " i do n't think he 's a good man . " the hill notes that mcconnell is a vocal critic of the trump campaign , and that he 'll be boycotting ivanka trump , who is also nudging trump toward nominating kethledge or thomas m. hardiman , and he 'll have to make his decision on the case as a matter of weeks .
