suzanne shawâ€” , 60 , and christie brinkley are still at each other 's custody battle with christie , but they 've got a different take : they 've been separated from brinkley and their 18-year-old daughter . the new york post has the backstory : cook , 55 , was divorced in 2012 , when she went to shaw 's apartment in florida , where she worked for six years . " christie and i have privately apologized to her , but given the public nature of their divorce and custody battle , i feel a public apology is also appropriate and deserved , " she wrote in a letter to his first wife . " the separation agreement does not mention , in any way , infidelity by mr. cook , and any such allegations to that end are without merit . " shaw , a longtime friend of the clintons , says he was " vilified as being an embittered ex-wife , " but " he lied to her and completely misrepresented himself . she repeatedly caught him cheating , " an insider tells the post , which notes that cook has a history of domestic violence , including his own daughter , diana bianchi , in the midst of a bitter divorce brawl that broke last month . " i think he had every right to do what she did by taking a public stand ; she was only trying to protect her children and have the truth be told . given the nature of peter 's behavior , he 's not going to be doing it , " he says . " it was the black cloud of christie brinkley 's own . "
