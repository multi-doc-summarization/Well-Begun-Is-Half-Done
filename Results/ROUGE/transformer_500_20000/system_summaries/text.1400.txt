" we believe this is the oldest example of the domestication of a wild-growing eurasian solely for the production grapevine grapevine , " says the lead researcher in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the <unk> jars containing wine improves with age , and if that 's true , the discovery is truly sublime and archaeobotanical , the guardian reports . researchers say they 've found residual jars of grape compounds in the south of the georgian capital of tbilisi , georgia , and elsewhere in the <unk> mountains of iran , which are believed to have been from about 7,000 years ago , reports the bbc . researchers say 8,000-year-old , a <unk> species known as vintnersâ€”producing wine , was found in two sites in iran . in a paper published in pnas , researchers say the jars were once decked with grapevines . " it 's a huge , huge courtyard , and a lot of stuff , " researcher rolf <unk> tells the guardian . " it was a lot bigger than it was , and it was very much like it was . " the guardian notes that the grapes ' pottery is decorated with bunches of the neolithic <unk> , which has a long heritage of winemaking . the bbc notes it 's also a fitting monument at the site of the <unk> , which sits about 8,000 years ago and is believed to be the site 's first evidence of grape wine-making by up to 1,000 years .
