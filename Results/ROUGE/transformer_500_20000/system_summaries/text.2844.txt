pope benedict xvi 's latest apology for the emerging global scandal of child abuse by predatory priests has prompted a barrage of criticism from church officials , the new york times reports . " homosexuality does not cause predatory behavior , " he said in a statement . " just like segregationists once accused african americans of raping white women . " the catholic league does n't rename the “ older man crisis ” or " anything of the sort . but all this misses the point . what the catholic church is trying to do is imply that there is a connection between homosexuality and molestation . " in other words , the times editorial board argues that the argument itself is confusing and contradictory , and the times points out that the paper " made no mention of the need to discipline diocesan leaders most responsible for mistakes that were made in wisconsin . " the editorial , however , calls the article " a homosexual crisis , " and notes that benedict 's editorial page has been " deficient by any reasonable standards of fairness. . " the times notes that the retraction comes after a catholic church pastor called for the resignation of pope benedict .
