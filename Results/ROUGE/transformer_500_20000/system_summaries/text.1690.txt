dzhokhar tsarnaev is telling authorities that he and his brother tamerlan tsarnaev were speaking with russian dialects , reports the new york daily news . " there was some information that they may have been intent on coming to new york , but not to continue doing what they ’ re doing , " says one of the brothers , who were inspired by an al propaganda magazine . " it ’ s not clear if it was a genuine terrorist attack . " tsarnaev , who is in fair condition , has been described as more than 170 injuries , including one in which he was killed in friday 's shootout with police in watertown , mass. , in the boston suburb of cambridge . the brothers are believed to have been killed in the attack , but they have n't been identified until now . the brothers have told investigators that the tsarnaev brothers acted alone , and they 're not sure whether they were related to the attack or if they were in the hands of the al-qaeda-affiliated nusra front or the group . the tsarnaev family , meanwhile , has a different view : " we ’ ve never seen anything like that , " said a police spokesman .
