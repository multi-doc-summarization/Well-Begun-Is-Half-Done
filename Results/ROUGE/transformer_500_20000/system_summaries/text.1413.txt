the newly appointed commissioner of new york city 's second-largest jail system in march insisted at a meeting of the jail board of correction that he was trying to quell levels of violence . commissioner joseph ponte , who took the helm of the march , tells the new york times that the june 13 move on rikers island resulted in 47 mentally ill inmates who were taken from air-conditioned mental observation units . " i would just hope that you would review these issues and in the future your staff to be consistent with the mental health issues , " he says . " they 're going to kill them . " ponte says the inmates were denied medication and had seizure disorders . at least one inmate suffered a seizure , and the ap reports that the city oversight board rejected the argument , saying it was " aware of the risks of the incident " and that it would be " immoral " and " inhumane " if it were n't resolved . the ap notes that ponte , whose contract with the city to provide health care at the jail , was aimed at repairing the use of solitary confinement by two thirds of maine 's state prisons , which has been mired in how-to manuals about inmates who may have been forced to stay in uncooled cells .
