scientists have discovered the hair samples used in the himalayas for 40 years , and it 's one of the most remarkable ones in the world , reports the bbc . in 2014 , geneticist bryan sykes and his colleagues looked at two hair samples from the himalayan region : one sample came from an aggressive animal walking on its hind legs . " there is essentially no reason to believe that they belong to a species other than the brown bear , " sykes tells the bbc . " it 's a huge loss for the bear . " the researchers say the " yeti " hair was found in a bamboo forest in northern india , and the other had been shot by a hunter in the bhutan . " it was a very exciting find , " he says . " we were surprised to learn that the hairs were from the matched the dna of ancient polar bears . " sykes , a fellow of evolutionary biology , says he has been seeking a scientific explanation for the abominable snowman , which tend to be the result of a larger string of attacks on humans and humans , per the bbc . the researchers note that the study is n't conclusive , though it 's not clear whether it 's the first such study to be published in the journal the proceedings of the royal society b , which has published dna tests on hairs from two unidentified animals in the area . the study 's lead author says the study shows that the bear may have been manipulated to carry out dna analysis on the polar bear . ( a recent study found that the brown <unk> the <unk> bear . )
