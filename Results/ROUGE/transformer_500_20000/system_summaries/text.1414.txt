two county commissioners in oregon say they 've used fetal remains to generate power at medical facilities , reports the ap . the marion county resource recovery facility in rural brooks might be burning medical waste that includes fetal tissue to generate electricity . " we 're going to get the bottom of it , " says janet carlson of vancouver . " i want to know who knew , when they knew , how long they had known this was going on . " brentano , however , says the county ordinance that sets the parameters for what can be accepted at the plant allows for all human tissue . " no rule or law has been broken , but there 's an ethical standard that 's been transported to the plant and then burned , " carlson says . the facility is a partnership between the county and covanta power generation of <unk> , which has 550 tons of municipal waste a year . the <unk> plant , which is a <unk> firm , says it plans to bar any future shipments that could contain fetal tissue . but the ap notes that it 's not clear how much fetal tissue from oregon has actually been broken . " we are outraged and appalled that this material could be included in medical waste received at our facility , " he says .
