the french government has voted in favor of a new law granting the state sweeping surveillance techniques within the country 's borders , the bbc reports . the bill passed the national assembly with 438 votes in june and just 86 against after three days of attacks in paris , according to the bbc . the bill will now go up before the french parliament 's upper house , and it 's expected to take account changes in communications technology . " the bill 's advocates wanted a legal framework for the french intelligence agencies , which is a good thing , " felix tr√©guer , founder of la quadrature , tells the new york times . " the fact is the law was being prepared for a long time , " he says . he says it 's a " french big brother , " but it 's not clear whether the law will be implemented . the bbc notes that in the meantime , the government is strengthening the intelligence community , and that it has n't done much to quell the unrest in the country . the government says it is working closely with jihadist groups , including the islamic state , which has been criticized by the government for glorifying islamist extremists .
