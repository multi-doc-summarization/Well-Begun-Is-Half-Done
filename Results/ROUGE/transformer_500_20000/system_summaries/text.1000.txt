the mexican attorney for the texas teen who killed 18-year-old ethan couch in his unfolding immigration fight says he 's " not mistreated " by mexican authorities . " he has n't committed a crime in mexico , " fernando benitez said in a phone interview . " why would mexico go along with this idea of locating someone and summarily kicking them out of the country so the marshals can grab him across the border ? i do n't think that 's okay . " benitez said the teen 's crimes here in the united states should have no bearing on mexican officials , or mexican courts , reports usa today . couch won a delay in his deportation based on a constitutional appeal in mexico that could lead to a trial process lasting weeks or even months . any flaw in the process of his detention by mexican immigration authorities can be considered a violation of due process and of his human rights , legal analysts say . benitez said he 's handling couch 's constitutional and civil rights may have been violated , reports the dallas morning news . he said the decision was " cordial and productive .
