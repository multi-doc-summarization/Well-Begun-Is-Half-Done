users of the brightest and most colorful stars in the sky on the night of october will be able to get a glimpse of the waning gibbous moon . the <unk> star aldebaran , which forms the bright orange eye of taurus , is either classified as " total " or grazing , which is what folks in most of the eastern and southern us will see . " you 'll probably see aldebaran and reappear several times in the darkness just barely off the moon 's dazzlingly north polar region , " the magazine states . the moon will cross in front of one of the most illuminated telescopes in the us and southern canada , and it will be the first time the moon has been seen since . " most of us events will be gradual rather than instantaneous , as hills and southeastern canada , " an international occultation association rep says . the <unk> , which includes the pacific northwest and central california , is the first lunar grazing in us history . the lucky region has been around 50 miles south of las vegas , where a line running from los angeles to denver , is believed to have been hijacked by a meteor shower .
