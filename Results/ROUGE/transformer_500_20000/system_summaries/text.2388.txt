abortion rights advocates made a final push against proposed state rules prohibiting hospitals from disposing of fetal remains , the texas tribune reports . " the rules target that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients for no reason other than to make it harder to get a safe , legal abortion in texas , " says a state health and human services commission official . " it 's so transparent that what they 're really trying to do is denying access to abortion . " the move comes after the department of state health services announced that it would require all medical facilities , hospitals and clinics to cremate or bury remains , no matter the period of gestation . the rules will take effect dec. 19 , but the state 's health commission clarified that the rules would not apply to miscarriages or abortions that take place at home , the tribune reports . the rules were first proposed in early july , but it 's not clear whether fetal remains should be treated like medical waste or death certificates . the department also added an additional month for people who oppose the proposal .
