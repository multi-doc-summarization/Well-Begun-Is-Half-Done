police in california say a man who was released from jail after a jury mistakenly signed a not-guilty form wednesday , the ap reports . bobby lee pearson , 37 , was stabbed to death after walking out of a courtroom following a jury 's mistake . " i could n't believe it . it was just pure shock . i just would have never believed it , " judge kent hamlin said in a statement . the judge said he had no choice but to order him to have a tough time at trial . " the fact that he left the scene is the indication of consciousness of guilt . you think you did something wrong so you run away . that 's allowed to come into evidence in a trial , " he said . " unless someone is watching this . unless there are some witnesses to say otherwise he may have a really good defense as self-defense , " the legal analyst said . the jury could n't reach a unanimous decision when it came to pearson 's defense , but the judge ruled that pearson was guilty of the burglary but because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the law explained to them , they entered a not guilty verdict and even confirmed it . the ap notes that the ruling was later overturned by a judge in harris county .
