a british army officer has become the youngest person to reach the south pole in the first place in the history of the nepal earthquake , reports the bbc . scott sears , a lieutenant of the first royal gurkha rifles , pulled a sled and supplies for 38 days through 150mph winds in temperatures of <unk> , crevasse , and glaciers . " i 've never experienced anything like it , i would take a couple of steps and just stop , everything was just saying 'no more , not one more step ' . ' it was bizarre as i 've genuinely been alone in a tent for nearly 6 weeks so it 's all a bit overwhelming , " he tells the bbc . he says he 's proud to be standing here now after 2 years of planning and training . " i could n't have asked for better weather but well truly hit a wall through the day , " sears says . he says that when he arrived at the pole , he used skis to cross the ice instead of hitting them . " the last 5 weeks have been a huge challenge but i â€™ ve been feeling pretty good . "
