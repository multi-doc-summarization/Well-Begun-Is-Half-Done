donald trump has announced that he will nominate attorney david friedman as us ambassador to israel , selecting an envoy who supports israeli settlements and other changes to us policies in the region . friedman , who has no diplomatic experience , has said that he does not believe it would be illegal for israel to annex the occupied west bank , jerusalem , even though the embassy is in tel aviv , the ap reports . " he has made that promise , " trump adviser kellyanne conway told reporters thursday . " i can guarantee you , just generally , he 's a man who is going to accomplish many things very quickly . " the ap notes that the move would also distance the us from most of the international community , including its closest allies in western europe and the arab world . friedman said the president-elect would " maintain the special relationship " between the us and israel . " but the announcement sparked anger from liberal jewish groups . " the u.s. embassy in israel 's eternal capital has been a very strong believer in a peace deal . like some of his predecessors , trump has vowed to move the american embassy to jerusalem .
