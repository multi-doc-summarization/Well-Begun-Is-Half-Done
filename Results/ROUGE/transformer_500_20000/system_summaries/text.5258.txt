" only now could i get myself together enough to be able to write . i 'm in a state of shock because of what i did and what has been done to me , " petra laszlo wrote in a letter to newspaper magyar . " i was recording with the camera when hundreds of migrants broke through the police cordon , one of them ran into me and i panicked . " " i had my camera in my hand i could n't see who was coming at me and then something snapped in my head . as i watch the footage now , it 's like i 'm not watching myself . i honestly regret what i have done and take responsibility for it , " she says . the times points out that germany and hungary are n't the only ones who are still here , but a fair quota of distribution of those who do n't agree with the peace . the times calls it " the greatest challenge the european union has faced in its history , " with the times noting that " none of these will be taken in by others , so i ask for understanding , that we discuss not only those who are already here .
