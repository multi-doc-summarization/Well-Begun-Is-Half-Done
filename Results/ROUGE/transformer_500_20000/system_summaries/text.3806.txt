" it wasn ’ t like to cover antifa and the alt-right more broadly . " in fact , a woman was killed during a rally in berkeley , calif. , on sunday , while covering berkeley 's rally against hate , the new york times reports . the man , who has been feuding with antifa protesters , says he did n't want anyone to get hurt . " so the only thing i could think was i wanted to get on top of him to protect , " he says , per the washington post . he says the man was " scared they were going to kill him , " and the crowd cheered him , and the protesters chanted " about 150 " members of the antifa movement , the post reports . " i think it ’ s not a anarchy movement , but i ’ m a racist , " letson says . the post notes that antifa movement has been viewed more than a million times as racist and sexist , with many viewed as racist . the post points out that antifa protesters have also been targeted because they 're black and hispanic , and that they 're not <unk> to the point of view .
