the family of michelle obama and amazon founder jeff bezos bought a piece of d.c. property for $ 8.1 million last year , the washington post reports . the obamas have been renting since they left the white house in january , but they have n't been able to sell a home rather than continuing to rent it . " given that president and mrs. obama will be in washington for at least another two and a half years , it made sense for the family , " says kevin lewis , the former white house press secretary under president bill clinton . the obamas will remain in the capital while their 15-year-old daughter , sasha , finishes high school in washington , dc . the post notes that the home is owned by bill clinton press secretary joe lockhart , who live a few blocks away from the executive mansion . the post reports that the mansion was built in 1921 and renovated in 2011 . the family has n't commented yet on the purchase , but the post points out that the obamas are home at the time of the trip . the post has a photo of the obamas here .
