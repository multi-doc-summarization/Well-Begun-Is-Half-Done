a siberian city has declared a state of emergency after at least 49 people died from drinking the apparently mislabeled bath oil , the bbc reports . according to russia 's investigative committee , the bath oil product actually contained methanol , which can cause blindness , but it 's a common practice in russia , where people consume methanol , the guardian reports . it 's the worst such case in modern russian history . according to irkutsk health minister oleg yaroshenko , 55 , says the bath lotion is cheap and can save them . " it 's not a good thing to do with survival , " he says . " 13 are in a very hard condition and the chances of survival are practically nil . " the post notes that while it 's unclear how many of those who are alive have almost no chances , it may be too late for survival . the bbc cites a 2015 study that found people who drank bath oil as a substitute for alcohol use have been mislabeled as a safe alcoholic drink or bath oil . it cites a study in the siberian times that found only 15 people were hospitalized and are in critical condition .
