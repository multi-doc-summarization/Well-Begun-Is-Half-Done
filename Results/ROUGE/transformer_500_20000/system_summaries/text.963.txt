a new study finds that wildlife numbers at chernobyl are likely to be much higher than they were before the accident . researchers at the university of portsmouth in the uk say that after a fire and explosion at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 , more than 100,000 people were permanently evacuated from the area , the bbc reports . " this does n't mean that radiation is good for wildlife , just that the effects of human habitation , including forestry , are a lot worse , " researcher jim smith tells the guardian . " it 's very likely that the wildlife in the area has been evacuated . " the study , published in current biology on october 5 , found that the chernobyl disaster area is thriving , the guardian reports . researchers say the chernobyl site looks like a " nature preserve , teeming with elk , roe deer , red deer , and wolves . " in fact , the study found that people who left the area were more damaging to wildlife than the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings , and the researchers say that while it 's not clear how long it 's radiation poisoning , it 's possible that the poisoning of the chernobyl basin has been linked to a collision between the chernobyl and wildlife . the researchers say <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
