new york 's highest court of appeals will hear arguments on whether dancing is an art and deserves a state tax exemption as such , reports the new york times . the case revolves around a strip club in suburban albany that contested a tax bill of more than $ 124,000 following a 2005 audit of sales taxes paid on the club 's non-alcoholic drinks . the state wants the court to prevent strip clubs from using the same sales-tax exemption as " live dramatic or musical arts performances . " the state tax appeals tribunal said the club did n't present sufficient proof that it qualifies for the exemption , but a cultural anthropologist who studied exotic dance and visited nite moves tells the times that " the fact that the dancers remove all or part of their costume ... simply does not render such dance routines as something less than choreographed performances . " the court 's ruling probably wo n't be widespread because most exotic dancers sell alcohol where other tax rules apply to theater or ballet , notes the times . " the club is relying on an administrative law that requires sales-tax moves from other dancers during slow shifts over time , " he says .
