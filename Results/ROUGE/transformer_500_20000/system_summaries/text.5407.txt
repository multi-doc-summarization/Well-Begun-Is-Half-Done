france 's lower house voted by a clear majority on tuesday to approve the government 's reform , which will allow same-sex couples the same spousal and adoption rights as their counterparts , reports the wall street journal . the move comes after the national assembly approved a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt children same-sex couples in france , spain , south africa , and the netherlands . the bill would mark the biggest step forward for french gay rights advocates in more than a decade , notes the new york times , which notes that france is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing nature of the death penalty . " we 've waged a great and noble battle , " says the president of the catholic church of commons . the bill , which is expected to pass through the senate next week , will see france join 11 other gay-marriage countries , including spain , sweden , and washington have also voted for marriage equality in the uk . the bill will be passed by the senate , or upper house , on april 2 , reports cnn .
