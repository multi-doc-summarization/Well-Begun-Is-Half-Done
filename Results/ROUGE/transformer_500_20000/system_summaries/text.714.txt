" it was bleak . " the filmmaker , who has been relying on spending six hours on the ocean 's deepest point—heroically known as challenger deep—it 's an amazing 6.78 miles to the bottom of the mariana islands , tells the new york daily news , " so what could have gone wrong ? implosion the obvious , and most catastrophic route to failure . a weak spot in materials , a design flaw in the vehicle that would have buckled . that does n't mean drowning ; it means james cameron would have known about it . " i don ’ t feel like i got to a place where i could take interesting geology samples or found anything biologically interesting , ” he says . “ i think it ’ s going to happen . ”
