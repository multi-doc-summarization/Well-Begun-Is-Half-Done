attorney general jeff sessions has filed a lawsuit against chicago 's immigrant community for going to court to block president trump 's department of justice from withholding police funding from so-called sanctuary cities , the chicago tribune reports . according to the suit , emanuel says emanuel should do even more to prevent police from helping federal officials deport chicago immigrants who entered the country without the required legal documentation . " to a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction , the political leadership of chicago has deliberately chosen to crack down on the issue , " sessions wrote in a letter to the chicago mayor . sessions , who has been accused of adopting an official policy of protecting criminal aliens , says the lawsuit is " all further complicated by differing views on whether sanctuary city status or crime . " the lawsuit claims the trump administration has been trying to cut off grants to police departments and agencies , the washington post reports . sessions says he has " no amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents . " the mayor says the suit is a sign of a new justice department policy that encourages police to ignore the law , the ap reports .
