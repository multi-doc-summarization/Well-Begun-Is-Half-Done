mischa barton 's mother has filed a lawsuit against her mother , nuala barton , in a lawsuit filed tuesday in los angeles county , claiming she 's a " greedy stage mother posing as a talent manager who , instead of acting in the best interest of her daughter/client , schemed to defraud her unsuspecting victim , " the suit claims . the los angeles times reports that the lawsuit claims barton kicked out of her own beverly hills mansion when she was 8 , agreeing to pay her mother a management fee equal to 10 % of her daughter 's earnings . barton is seeking unspecified damages , triple the amount the court finds her mother to have withheld . the suit also accuses the actress of breach of fiduciary duty , breach of oral contract and conversion . in the suit , mischa says she was n't aware of the lawsuit . " i was never my manager but she was always with me on set , " she says , per the hollywood reporter . " i did n't know what was going to happen . " she adds that she was " shocked and dismayed " by the lawsuit , which also accuses her mother of " <unk> to defraud " her daughter , who is suing the family , property and image of her husband and children . the lawsuit says the lawsuit is " absurd , " but it 's not the only lawsuit filed against barton , who has filed suit against her mom and is due in court next month .
