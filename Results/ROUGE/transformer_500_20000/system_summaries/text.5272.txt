the largest four-winged dinosaur known has been found , and this predator has the longest feathers yet outside of birds , researchers say . the 125-million-year-old feathered , named changyuraptor yangi , sported over its arms and legs , which made it look as if it had two pairs of wings , the los angeles times reports . " hey ! that is a weird-looking bird , " says paleontologist alan turner of the natural history museum in new york . " it measured a bit more than 4 feet long , and weighed roughly 9 pounds . " it 's not always easy to tell what is and is not a bird . " the dinosaur 's body was found in feathers in a way that gave the appearance of a second set of wings . researchers say the dinosaur likely flown from china to north america , but it was n't the first time that it was built around the world . " it was amazing that it 's very sad that we 're going to be able to glide for it , but we do n't think it 's going to make it happen , " turner tells live science .
