donald trump 's campaign is teetering , threatening to collapse under the weight of a candidate whose personality outweighs his political skill , and now , with 22 days until the start of early voting , the new york times reports . according to the washington post , trump has in many respects assumed the role of campaign manager katie walsh and chris carr as well as chief of staff . the plan is based on field offices in battlegrounds , which will decide the election , and those briefed on it , according to a press release . kushner , who met with labor day and the final stretch of the 2016 election , is ahead by 4 or 5 percentage points , while trump has 342 percentage points in the past two weeks . the post notes that trump has a double-digit lead in the polls , but it 's not clear whether he will continue to gain ground , either . the post points out that clinton has a strong chance of winning the nomination , which could be seen as a major setback for trump 's convention in 2016 . the post reports that the gop has been trying to get to 270 electoral votes , with a majority of precincts reporting .
