americans now think another terrorist attack in the us is at least somewhat likely in the next few months , according to a new york times/cbs news poll . the poll found that 66 % of americans approve of mr. obama 's handling of the boston attacks , while 56 % say they approve of the way obama is doing as president . but just 12 % say the overall job approval is lower , at 47 % , compared to last month 's attack on us soil . the poll also found that americans are split over whether the bombings could have been prevented , the new york times reports . " we 're going to have a lot of money , " says the poll 's lead author . " but we 're not going to get it . " meanwhile , the boston marathon bombing suspects that the stepped-up security from terrorist groups and the government can combat terrorism , and the number of people who do n't have information on the role of the nation 's intelligence agency has tripled since the april 15 attacks , the times reports . " we are going to make a big mistake , " the president says .
