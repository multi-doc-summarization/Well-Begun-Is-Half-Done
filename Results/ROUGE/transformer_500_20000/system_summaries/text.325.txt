a 12-year-old girl who was on the south pasadena police force only for a year has been flagged down by bystanders who said he could help her back over the bridge railing . " i walked up to her calmly . i literally did n't even start talking to her until i made it to the sidewalk and just asked her what was happening , " said chris perez , per cbs news . " she told me she was upset by a group home that she was living at , and that 's why she ran away . " perez walked to the area where the 12-year-old girl was dangling from the bridge , which was about 80 feet over asphalt . " she was just crying and holding on , " he said . " it took time , patience and trust . " perez , who had been with the department since a year ago , was able to calm her down , and he asked if he could come closer to speak to her more personally . " it was just back-and-forth banter with me and her . " the girl told perez she was scared and needed help , but the girl says she did n't rush up , and she did so . the officer quickly developed a rapport with the girl and was taken to a hospital in los angeles on tuesday .
