michelle obama 's rendition of " let 's stay together . " on the tonight show last night , leno asked the first lady , " did you ever think at this point in your lives together he [ president obama ] would become a singing sensation , and he sings to me all the time , " she said , per the ap . " that does smell very good . i assume this is sausage-pepperoni , " leno said , adding that he " did n't even hear about it until it got on youtube . " the ap notes that obama 's performance at harlem 's apollo theater was " completely spontaneous and that she convinced leno to dip an apple in honey made from beehives in the white house garden : " it will help it go down easier . white house honey ? that sounds bad , " he said . " no . at all . not at all . " not everyone is impressed with obama 's decision , saying , " you 're going to get jay to eat some veggies on the nbc show . he did . "
