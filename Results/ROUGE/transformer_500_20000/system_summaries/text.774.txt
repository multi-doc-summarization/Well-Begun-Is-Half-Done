a new study out of applied physics letters will be useful in medical and manufacturing applications , reports the bbc . " the robots could be useful for administering medicine or carrying out in vitro fertilization , at scales , " says a researcher at the university of twente in the netherlands . " we have built a biologically inspired micro-robot that looks like a sperm cell but is completely fabricated in the lab . " it 's not the first time the robot has been used to use a magnetic field about six times the width of a human hair . the researchers say that while the sperm bots were exposed to an oscillating magnetic field , it 's difficult to assemble objects on the head , notes the bbc . ( in other words , researchers say they 've figured out how to use the robot 's magnetic fields . ) the team 's team says that while it 's a " swim , " the team is working on a project to determine whether it 's capable of succeeding at all .
