james inhofe is offering the white house a deal with president obama that would increase the " risk of terrorist activity " at guantanamo bay , reports the new york times . " we need a legal system that gives due process to the detainee but also understands they did n't rob a liquor store , " he said . " is not their approval ; it 's getting it right ? " he added , referring to graham 's campaign speech in new york . " what drives my train , " said graham , who has heard it all before . graham , meanwhile , says he plans to ignore " the american people and was making a deal on terrorism trials . " the deal is not expected for several weeks , notes the washington post , which notes that graham is a republican in name only , not to mention a " cretin " and " a poster child for everything that is anathema to conservative republicans . " the post has a similar take : " it was a key promise obama made when he reached him late in the week , " says the post .
