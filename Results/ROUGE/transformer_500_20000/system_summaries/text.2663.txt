jian ghomeshi , the cbc reports , was sitting with a group of people , jake gyllenhaal among them ( sorry , how do you pronounce your name again ? ) he says he met a man i 'll call at an outdoor concert in toronto last year . " oh , i thought it was more complicated , like carafalooota , " he says . " i laughed . a few minutes later , the concert was over , and my party and i left.the next day , i sent keith a public twitter message saying it was nice to get you on my show and maybe into your pants . just kidding . there were no love vibes , and the only feeling jake had was annoyance after keith arrived . " ghomeshi says he was n't feeling his guilt , but he was " horrified " by the allegations . he says the women were verbally abused by sex , and that they had difficulty breathing . " i did n't know what to do with it , but i did not know what i was going to do , " ghomeshi tells the new york daily news . " it was just a matter of time . " the cbc notes that ghomeshi 's facebook page has been shared more than 300,000 times .
