it 's not illegal to carry a firearm into nfl stadiums , but a new amendment to the seattle seahawks is prohibiting a private company from banning guns from stadiums on public land , reports the seattle times . the bill was proposed by three republican members of the state house of representatives in washington state , dc , and centurylink , which would allow fans to bring certain items into their venues . " centurylink , like safeco , is located on public property , but it 's run by a private enterprise , one that prohibits people from bringing in guns , " says brian mccarthy , the nfl 's vice president of communications . the bill is intended to apply to fans in the state , but the seahawks are balking at the bill . " we have n't seen the proposed legislation but we have a lot to do with it , " he says . " the new law , first noticed by the times , would change that . here 's the full text of the proposed law , which is based on chapter 36.102 , which has been criticized for not being a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in any facility or on any grounds of a facility that is owned , operated , or administered , managed to carry concealed license from any facility . " the chargers have the highest arrest rate in the nfl , and the nfl is considering legal action .
