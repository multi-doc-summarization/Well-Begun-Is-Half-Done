spanish riot police smashed their way into polling stations to try to halt a disputed independence referendum in catalonia on sunday and fired rubber bullets at protesters outside a polling station , the ap reports . several people were injured when police confiscated ballot boxes from the center of the catalan police officers , who were trying to prevent national police cars from driving away . " today 's events in catalonia can never be portrayed as a referendum or anything similar , " says a 48-year-old it manager who tried to block police from entering the building . the spanish government says 38 people were treated for minor injuries , but the state 's representative says any attempt to claim the referendum as valid is doomed . the state has ordered police to stop the voting process , saying it 's illegal . catalan president artur mas says the government is " professionally " to enforce court orders , and the state is not getting enough in return . the ap notes that the separatist catalans have complained of contributing to the crackdown , which has been on the rise since the vote was called in early september .
