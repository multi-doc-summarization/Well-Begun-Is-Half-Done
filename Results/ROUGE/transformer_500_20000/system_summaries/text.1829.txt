online dating sites like new york and new jersey have been hit with a spate of crime stories , and the market research firm ibisworld says it 's time to figure out how much violence stems from dating sites , more than double the number five years ago . " what we want to do is provide some degree of safety , " says robert buchholz of the national center for victims of crime . " we 're finding casual dates and even love , they are also married people to be single or worse , sexual predators and convicted felons . no one has put a number on <unk> sites , but it 's not clear whether they 're on the horizon or if they do n't get it . " in fact , a serial rapist in philadelphia who met his victims on match.com has been linked to a slew of imitators , reports the new york times . " it 's a huge surprise to me , " buchholz says . " i think it 's going to be a good idea . " but the law enforcement officials say they 're not sure what to do with the laws . " we do n't know what to say , but we 're not going to do it . "
