cardinal jorge bergoglio seemed to sum up the themes and challenges the leaders were debating whether he would be elected to replace pope francis xvi , who resigned last month , reports the new york times . " then they went fairly quickly to bergoglio , " he said in the final round of voting , which took place in the sistine chapel and closed away the outside world tuesday , notes the washington post . the cardinals voted for a number of individuals as a courtesy of the vatican , but the cardinals did n't have much luck with bergoglio , who was forceful without being abrasive , one cardinal said . " he ended up with “ more than sufficient votes to win , the brazilian cardinal , cardinal scola , and cardinal marc ouellet of canada , ” said the vatican expert in the newsweekly panorama , which calls the move a " seminal moment " in the history of bergoglio and europeans in his career . the cardinals , however , have n't been able to solidify their lists of candidates in the past , including bergoglio and cardinal raul <unk> , but they have n't yet made a formal oath of secrecy that bars them from entering the americas .
