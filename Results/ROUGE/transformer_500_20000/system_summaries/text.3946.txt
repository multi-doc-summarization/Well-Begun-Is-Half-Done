alaska 's gov . bill walker says he would use his executive powers to expand the medicaid program for the next six years , the washington post reports . " why ? because it helps their residents , their economies and their budgets , " walker said in a letter to state legislators , per the new york times . the move comes after walker 's budget director , pat pitney , has already had several expansion efforts blocked by the state legislature since 2014 , the wall street journal reports . he says he will apply directly to washington to extend medicaid coverage to most residents whose incomes are up to one-third above the poverty line in his state . he says the move will be a wake-up call for the poor , and the state committed to something it can not afford . " today 's spending will be paid by tomorrow 's taxpayers to vote whether or not to support the state 's request for money , or to recommend a special session of the legislature to review expansion options , " the independent quotes walker as saying . walker , who says he 's " conflicted " about the law , says the law is " absurd " and that it 's " irresponsible " to make it more likely other states would follow suit . " i do n't think it 's going to happen , " he says .
