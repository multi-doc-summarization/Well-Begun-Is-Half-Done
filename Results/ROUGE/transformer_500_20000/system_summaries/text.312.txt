house minority leader nancy pelosi says she will not trade with president trump for his border wall . " it happens to be like a manhood issue for the president , building a wall , and i ’ m not interested in that , " she tells roll call . " in fact , it ’ s probably the worst way to protect the border . " pelosi , who has been in charge of the wall for a decade , has been speaking out against the wall since the end of september , the washington post reports . " we can ’ t allow him to say we ’ re not going to make any changes to our country and our southern border , " pelosi says in a letter to the harvard kennedy school 's institute of politics . the president has been trying to raise funds for border security and immigration reform , the hill reports . " i want to do it , and if unable to do so i will call up the us military and close advisers , i can say , in the strongest of terms , that ’ s what we ’ ve ever seen , " he says . " i think that 's a very good thing . i think he ’ s going to be able to make it through the next few months . " she says trump is n't the only way to get trump 's border wall , which he says " is far more important to me , as president , than trade or the usmca . "
