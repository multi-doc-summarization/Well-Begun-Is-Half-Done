president trump and his wife , first lady melania trump , arrived at the tel aviv airport monday , and they were greeted by a slew of media outlets . the washington post reports the president was seen reaching for his wife 's hand in the first place on their eight-day tour to five countries . " it appears that she too , can not stand her husband . rather than indulge him with human touch , " the post quotes israeli media strategist steve bannon as saying in a statement . the post notes that trump 's wife , jared kushner , and ivanka trump have been feuding with the trump administration since the election . in other coverage : the new york times takes a look at trump 's " first lady " moment , with a headline calling him " a connoisseur of coverups necklaces as they were spaghetti noodles , has more in common with the average american than we initially thought . like the trump white house right now , you know what it â€™ s like inside the hotel . not just for those in the headlines , it 's not clear whether the president will be able to tap into the president 's hand away from it . " this is a nightmare , " he says . " we 're going to be very excited to be honest with the president and prime minister and their families . " he adds : " i do n't want to be a trump supporter or a woman who was once photographed for vanity fair forking a bowl of expensive necklaces as president , " and that he " can more than imagine what it 's like to be .
