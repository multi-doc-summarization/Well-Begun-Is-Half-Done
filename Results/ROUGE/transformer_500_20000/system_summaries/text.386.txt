a small amount of radioactive , plutonium , and plutonium about the size of a quarter of the quarter is missing , according to university officials . the sample , weighing a gram , was lost as it was being taken out of service after employees only partially filled out the necessary paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium . " unfortunately , because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003 , " says isu van der schyf , vice president for research at the university of idaho . " the radioactive source in question poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety . " the nrc has very rigorous controls for the use and storage of radioactive materials as evidenced by this enforcement action , " he said in a statement to the ap . idaho state university has a nuclear regulatory commission on friday to propose an $ 8,500 fine for about a 30th of an ounce of radioactive material that 's used to make nuclear bombs to spread radioactive contamination . it 's not clear what caused the plutonium to explode or whether it would be used in nuclear weapons or if it was a bomb or a terrorist attack . the ap notes that the sample was transferred to a licensed disposal facility in idaho , but it 's unclear if the sample is genuine .
