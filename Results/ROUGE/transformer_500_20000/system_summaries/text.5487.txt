the mountains of hawaiian islands have been dissolved until the end of the century , but scientists say they 've found a way to figure out how fast the island is going away and what the influence of climate is on that rate . " more material dissolving from those islands than what is being carried off through erosion , " says brigham young university geologist steve nelson . " the rainfall rates are variable , too , because rainfall is so variable , so it 's a great natural laboratory , " nelson says . the research , done by comparing the effects of groundwater compared to stream water from the island each year , is often considered to be the primary culprit . researchers say the island will be reduced to a flat , <unk> island similar to midway . " all of the hawaiian islands are made of just one kind of rock , " the geologist says in a press release . the island 's soil and surface conditions are " variable " and " too variable " in the area . " the island becomes a nearly flat island , " he says . " it 's not the case on oahu . "
