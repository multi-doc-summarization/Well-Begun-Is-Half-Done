interior secretary ken salazar called a six-month halt on drilling " needed , appropriate and within our authorities " in announcing he will issue a new order on a moratorium just hours after a federal judge blocked such a mandate . " we see clear evidence every day , as bp continues to be unable to stop its blowout , the huge efforts and help from the federal scientific team and most major oil companies operating in the gulf of mexico , " he said in a statement . " that eliminates any doubt that a moratorium is needed , saying only " in the coming days . " salazar 's statement did not give an exact date for when the new order would be imposed , cnn reports . the white house said it would appeal the ruling , but the ap reports that the ban will be lifted in more than 500 feet of water and prevented new permits from being issued . the ap notes that bp has already ordered the moratorium after the april 20 explosion , and that the drilling is n't the first time the deepwater horizon spill has been postponed .
