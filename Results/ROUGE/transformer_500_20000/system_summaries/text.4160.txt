phillip boyle and jamie blyth sat through the last-minute trip to thailand on friday night , and they were greeted by a layover in abu dhabi , the telegraph reports . " i was worse when we came ! " boyle , the 33-year-old capuchin monkey , tells the gazette . " it was around the bend there , " he says . " if we were there for a week or so we didn ’ t even have flights . it ’ s a last minute bad idea but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea . i nearly canceled when [ we were ] on the way to manchester airport and realized this is all a bit rash and nothing was booked . " the telegraph notes that boyle , who has been nicknamed " <unk> , " has been in the news for more than two decades , has been the subject of a wave of criticism over the past few years , including the fact that he has been deprived of his own life . " we went out for meals and to bars and stay in thailand , " boyle says , adding that he 's " feeling okay now , " and that he hopes to make amends with the " <unk> . "
