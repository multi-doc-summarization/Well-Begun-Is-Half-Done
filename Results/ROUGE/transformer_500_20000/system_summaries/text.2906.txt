" cold as ice the hearing , presided over by judge william p. brady , was held in sycamore , about 70 miles west of chicago and near where maria was abducted as she played in the snow , " brady said . " she was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back . on the other side of the room , maria 's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended . " the judge pointed out that mccullough 's murder was premeditated . " i love you , " mccullough said in a statement , adding that he would be released friday . mccullough 's defense team , however , did n't find any evidence that mccullough was murdered in the abduction and killing the 7-year-old in sycamore .
