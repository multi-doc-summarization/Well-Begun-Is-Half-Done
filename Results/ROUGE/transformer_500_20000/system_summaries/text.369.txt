the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate than previously predicted , according to a new hubble press release . the hubble space telescope has mapped the universe that make up 95 % of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation . it 's also expanding fast enough to double the distance between 19 and 9 % faster than the rate derived from galactic 's measured gravity . " this is a generally accepted scientific understanding , " study co-author adam riess says in a press release . " it 's not about the gravity of the universe . " the new york times points out that the universe 's expansion of our universe is 5 % to 2.0 % faster , while the hubble telescope is about to <unk> million light-years per second per year . that means the universe may be faster than we thought . " we 're not going to be surprised to see if it 's a good idea that we 're going to find a lot more interesting , " he says . " we 've got a lot of data that we 've seen , and we 've been on the verge of reaching a faster rate than the speed of expansion . " the guardian notes it 's " the first step in the direction of that expansion , " though it 's still not clear whether it 's the only one that will be mapped out of the solar system . " it is an amazing finding , " riess says . " we are going to see a lot faster . "
