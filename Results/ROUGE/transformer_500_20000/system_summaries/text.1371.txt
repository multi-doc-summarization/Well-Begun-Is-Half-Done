elon musk 's boring company plans to build a multi-state underground hyperloop along the eastern corridor , reports the washington post . the high-speed system uses a sealed tube in the air , and it 's not clear whether it will take just 30 minutes . musk tweeted that he had received verbal govt approval for his firm , boring company to create their own versions of hyperloop . " it ’ s a very small , very vague step forward , " said musk . " but that isn ’ t stopping elon musk from pushing forward with it. ” the white house has already received a permit from london to new york city , which takes more than four hours on a train from london . “ we ’ re not going to get it , but we ’ ve got it , ” said musk . “ we have a lot of things to do . we have to do with it . " the trip is n't the only one that 's already in the works : it 's also a high-speed rail transport system that involves a magnetic levitation , a <unk> , and no other support for the project .
