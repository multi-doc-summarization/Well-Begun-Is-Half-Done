a study published in plos one finds that great apes may be even more like us than we thought . researchers at leipzig zoo in germany say orangutans and bonobos are the nearest relatives of humans in the primate world , reports the guardian . the study found that the male and two bonobos , aged 18 to 31 years , had five months to 48 years , and three females , two months , and a half , were mistaken about the location of an object . " this study shows the great apes can use an understanding of false beliefs to help others appropriately , " says david buttelmann of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in germany . in fact , the researchers say they 've found a correlation between advanced social cognition and the fact that bonobos ' beliefs were true or false . the study also found that bonobos tended to help a person who did n't have the capacity to understand when a person is wrong in their beliefs . but the study did n't shed much light on what 's known as a " false belief . " in the study of human babies born between 1980 and 1984 , the males ranged in age from 9 months to 33 years , while six of them were male . the apes were also more likely to survive in a social world , and researchers say that if they do , they could understand why they do so without their knowledge of their relationship . ( another study finds that the study is n't conclusive . )
