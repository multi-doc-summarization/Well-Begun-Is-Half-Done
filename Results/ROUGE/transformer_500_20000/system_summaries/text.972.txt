" i went from going for a run to being in the ambulance , " she says . " how do you feel guilty for something you didn ’ t even know you did ? it ’ s definitely made me reconsider everything . who was i then — is that part of me ? " she adds that she had no memory of where she was or what she had done while she was missing . " it was like 10 minutes had passed . but it was almost three o'clock , " says maggie guzman , who has since been taken to a hospital . " it 's still somehow you . so it 's not your fault , but you ’ re still trying to get out of it and you ’ ve got to get it . " upp says she was overwhelmed by hurricane maria , but she says her disappearance is n't the result of a amnesia . her family says they 've been friends and family in the past for the past three months , and they 've received more than $ 370,000 to help the family . " we forget things in large pieces that involve what they are doing for the last year or two years , " guzman says in a facebook post .
