the washington post has a look at the second presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton , and it 's a doozy : melania trump is " the stuff of nightmares . " in the minds of many pundits , including maggie haberman at politico , who calls it a " pussy-bow sartorial reverberation of her gucci garment . " " when you ’ re a star , they let you do it , " she says . " it 's like a magnet . just kiss . i do n't even wait . " the post points out that trump 's wife , billy bush , has been a vocal critic of women 's genitals and insulted them by the pussy . " you know , i 'm automatically attracted to beautiful — i just start kissing them , " he says , adding that he has a " <unk> " shirt that has cost the business more than $ 1 million . " i think it 's going to be ridiculous , but it ’ s not going to make it to the people who are , " says one of the women who spoke about the " inexcusable " behavior . " it ’ ll have to be a shame if you don ’ t have a president who ’ s been trying to get to the polls , " writes alexandra petri at the new republic . " if you 're hustling to finish the debate on the campaign trail , you can get a glimpse of it . "
