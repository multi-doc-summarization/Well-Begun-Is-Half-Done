the pastor of the lutheran church in andreas lubitz 's hometown said sunday that the community stands by him and his family , despite the fact that prosecutors blame the co-pilot for causing the crash . " what we should critically examine is the mischief that some 'experts ' get up to , especially in tv talk shows , " capt . patrick sondenheimer told the weekly am sonntag . " sometimes people there speculate , fantasize and lie with no basis in fact , " he said , per the ap . the plane 's owner , tom enders , says the plane crashed into a ravine at 435 miles . " for god 's sake , open the door ! " enders says . the 26-year-old , who was living with the unnamed woman in his apartment , says she had told her that she was pregnant when she arrived at the crash site . she says the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and crashed the cockpit door , pleading for the co-pilot to take it to the french alps and to take the plane to the area . the ap reports that lubitz , who has also ordered two new cars for the french gendarmerie and park , is believed to have been the mastermind of the crash . the ap notes that the crash happened in the french city of le vernet , france , last week , when the plane was hit by the propeller , and a laborer from south africa who died from cancer in 2006 . the guardian reports that the flight data recorder has not been released , but the german newspaper bild and der spiegel say it 's " not clear " why the crash occurred
