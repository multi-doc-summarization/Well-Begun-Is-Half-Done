google says it has mistakenly included code in our software that can pick up data from wifi networks , reports the wall street journal . the company says the collection was a mistake , but it has n't stopped collecting and store payload from networks that were encrypted . " when we announced three weeks ago that we would ask a third party to review the software at issue , how it worked , and what data it did with that information , " the company said in a blog post . " we are continuing to work with the relevant authorities to respond to their questions and concerns . " the report comes after a german security firm launched an investigation into the company 's handling of federal wiretapping laws , reports cnet . google says the move is " very slightly edgy , and the gist of the story " that it uses in its own writeup of the report 's findings . " we 're not invading anybody 's privacy ; and ( b ) other people have been doing this stuff even long than we have . " google has n't commented on the specifics of the hack , but the new york times points out it 's not clear how many wifi networks set up in neighborhoods where the cameras traveled .
