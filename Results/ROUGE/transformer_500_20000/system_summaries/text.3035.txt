" if we 're right , we 'll have to rewrite that part of history , " says christian stenseth , who notes that the study 's lead author is a meta-analysis of primate studies and found that people infected with fleas were more likely to develop symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days , reports npr . the study , published in plos one , found that the rats were responsible for allowing the plague to flourish as much as seven days . the researchers say that while it 's not clear whether the disease causes the disease , it can cause heart attacks , and it 's possible the bacteria may have ingested the bacteria in the fleas of humans or humans . " it 's a very dangerous situation that has persisted for years , but it 's very difficult for people to get out of their lives , " christian tells the bbc . " it is not a pathogen or a human . it 's an infection that kills people and animals . "
