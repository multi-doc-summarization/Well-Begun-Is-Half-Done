robert griffin and falon were driving to san antonio 's university hospital when they pulled into the chick-fil-a parking lot to drop off their other two daughters with a family friend . " chick-fil-a was closed , it was way past 10 , " robert griffin tells ksat . " we were able to bang on the door , because she kept saying she had to go to the bathroom . " falon , who was 38 weeks pregnant at the time , says she needed to use a bathroom . " i can see just the top of gracelyn 's head , just barely crowning , but i knew we could n't go anywhere . so i told her , 'sweetie , we 're gon na do it right now , ' " she says . falon says the bathroom break would change their lives . " i hear high screaming and i was like , okay , " he says . " this is a very sad day for the family . " the chick-fil-a employees say they were n't aware of the situation and were surprised to learn about it . " i could n't hold anything in , " griffin says , adding that he 's not a doctor who has been listed as the attending physician . he says he has no plans to do so , and he hopes to make amends with the family .
