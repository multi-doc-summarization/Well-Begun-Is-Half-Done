alex jones is back in new york city , and he 's got a lot of attention . the man who started the white house petition to deport piers morgan says he was " the best advertisement for gun control you could wish for , " politico reports . " they ’ re like cops from the movie good fellas , " he says . " there 's got to be a level of discourse that can rise above what happened last night . it was undignified , unedifying . " jones , who was operating the camera , says that he was being harassed by a member of the nypd and the mafia hired by nyc mayor mike bloomberg . he says he 's " concerned that someone like him has that level of influence , " and that he has n't done much to dampen his anger about gun control . " if you don ’ t know that bloomberg is total mafia , you ’ re going to be going to kill you . " he tells politico that he plans to make a " big , long rant " with morgan himself . " i think it ’ s a good thing . "
