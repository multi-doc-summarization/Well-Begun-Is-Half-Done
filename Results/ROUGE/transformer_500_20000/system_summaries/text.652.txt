the international bottled water association has commissioned its first ever sensitive study to figure out how much water goes into making a bottle of water , npr reports . according to npr , the water footprint includes all freshwater used in production , including the water used for packaging . " packaging makes a significant footprint , " says chris hogan of the international water association . " you need water to make the paper , too . " ercin says it 's " hard to know where to stop it . " the study is based on a number of bottled water companies that should include the water in their supply chain . the study found that bottled water uses far less water than soda , which needs to be eaten by six or seven times what 's inside the bottle . ercin says that while it is n't so bad , it wo n't happen to anyone else . " we do n't think it 's going to happen again , " he tells npr . " it 's a very dangerous , very dangerous situation . " the environmental activists are worried about a possible downgrade of a water footprint that could be used to make it easier for people to find opportunities for conservation .
