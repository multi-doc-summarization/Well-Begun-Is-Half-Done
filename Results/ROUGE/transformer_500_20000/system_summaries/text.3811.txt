disco frontman brendon urie has been recognized as an advocate for the lgbt community since panic , but he 's now apologizing for his " stage gay persona . " " that song was about my first threesome , but they made it about coming out and accepting who you are as a person , which i thought , ‘ what a way better message , ' " urie tells paper magazine . " i guess you could qualify me as pansexual because i really don ’ t care . if a person is great , then a person 's in the right place . taking this thing that i wrote about and then changing it to be more inspiring for your own purposes . " he says he has made some uncomfortable in the past . " for our first headline tour i would go up to ryan , our guitar player , and like kiss him on the mouth , and he would be so mad , " urie says . " i was like , ‘ i just want to kiss you , bro. ’ i would hang out with friends and after five or six beers , we ’ re just kind of like smooching on each other . people just get hammered and fool .
