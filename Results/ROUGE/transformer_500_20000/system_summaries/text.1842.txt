donald trump has been banned from entering the uk due to the threat of terrorism , but the university of commons has decided to revoke its award of the honorary degree it bestowed on him in 2010 . the petition , which has been viewed more than a quarter of a million times as of this writing , says it will be discussed in the house by the same author as robert gordon university , the guardian reports . " the same principles should apply to everyone who wishes to enter the uk , " the petition reads . " this same principle should be donald trump â€™ s honorary degree . " the uk has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech , and the guardian notes that the petition was created by suzanne kelly , who wrote the petition to block aberdeen 's release . " we 've won the campaign ! " she wrote in a follow-up post at the guardian , which notes that trump has n't commented yet on the petition . the petition is seeking to depose muslims in the uk and to establish the validity of trump 's call to be banned from traveling abroad and abroad . cnn notes that may not be the first time trump has made a number of statements that are wholly incompatible with the trump campaign .
