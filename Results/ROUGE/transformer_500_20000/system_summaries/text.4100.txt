president trump tweeted that " obama era investigations , of two very popular republican congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge , just ahead of the jeff sessions justice department .

" two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time . good job jeff ... " the president 's striking suggestion that the justice department consider politics when making decisions showed his disregard for the agency 's independence . trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but the charges have raised democratic hopes . a spokeswoman for sessions declined comment . the white house did not have any public bidding lightly on the attorney general , though he was also under investigation by congressional ethics officials . hunter has not exited his race , while collins ended his re-election bid days after his indictment . both seats appear likely to remain in gop hands , but investigators are n't sure if they 're republicans . the indictment into collins lays out behavior from 2017 , which includes spending campaign funds for personal expenses and rep. chris collins of new york .
