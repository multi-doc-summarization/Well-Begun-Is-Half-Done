president trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care , according to people familiar with the matter on capitol hill and in the health-care industry . the white house says it will end billions of dollars in payments to insurers under the affordable care act program , which could happen almost immediately , the washington post reports . " allowing insurers to sell narrow , health plans likely will cause significant economic harm to women and older , americans who stand to face higher-cost and fewer insurance premiums , " says the chief executive of the community health and human services has determined there is no basis for guidance from the justice department , the hill reports . in a statement thursday , trump slammed the law as " open enrollment " and said it " will draw younger and healthier people away from the exchanges and drive additional plans out of the market . " it 's not clear whether the law will apply to the new products , but politico notes that it 's unlikely to be able to pass the law .
