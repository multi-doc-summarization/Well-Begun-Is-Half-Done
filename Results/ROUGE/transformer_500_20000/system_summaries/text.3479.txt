firas jumaah turner , 48 , received a text message asking her to remove him from the doctoral program if he had n't returned to sweden within a week . " what was happening was completely unacceptable and they had no idea that a professor would be able to do anything for us , " she wrote , per nbc news . " i was desperate . i just wanted to tell my supervisor 'how was happening . i had no hope then at all . " the message went viral after turner and his wife , who had rung him in a bleach factory in the town of sinjar in iraq . " my wife was totally panicking . everyone was shocked at how is were behaving , " turner tells lund 's university magazine . " i took the first plane there to be with them . what sort of life would i have if anything had happened to them there ? " turner says . " i had a very strong reaction , " he adds , adding that he was n't willing to leave her student to die without trying to do something . he says that after his wife 's death , he was killed by a bullet in the back of the head , and he was taken to a local hospital , where he was pronounced dead at a hospital . the family has been devastated by the death of a swedish man who was killed in a iraq war in afghanistan in 2012 , but turner 's family says it 's " very sad " to see him again .
