" all you get is the lessons and very little of the naturalism or idiosyncrasy or personality that made the person iconic in the first place , " writes wesley morris in the los angeles times . the biopic , he writes in the new york times , was " basically a hero giving a feel-good book report on himself . he 's been in bubble ever since .
