" this is a real blow for everyone , " says the president of the administration . " most of us pay taxes , we 're not living off the government , we â€™ re going to move to honduras with their children and the couple do not intend to return north , she said , though they worry about violence and political instability in central america . " trump changes to the program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in the united states or apply for other forms of immigration relief , officials say . the trump administration says it will provide a temporary haven for victims , not a permanent right to remain in the country until the end of 2019 . it 's not clear how long the program will be implemented or whether it will be protected by the us or remain illegally . the post notes that trump has lived in north carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her honduran husband .
