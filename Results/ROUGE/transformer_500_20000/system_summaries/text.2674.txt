president obama 's decision to deny construction of the $ 8-billion project exceeded his power under the north american free trade agreement last month , the wall street journal reports . according to the journal , transcanada plans to seek $ 15 billion in damages from a trade tribunal in houston and north dakota on wednesday . transcanada says it will sell the pipeline to refineries in canada and the united states to bring crude from alberta . transcanada says the pipeline will be in the hands of the us secretary of state john kerry , attorney general loretta lynch , and homeland security secretary jeh johnson . the us government says it would not make a meaningful contribution to the us economy and that it would be " arbitrary and unjustified . " the lawsuit claims the us has never denied a cross-border oil pipeline in canada , though it 's not clear whether the us will have a permit for the pipeline . the journal notes that the pipeline , which was first proposed in november , is owned by the mexican government and the us virgin islands . the journal calls it a " separate piece of evidence " of the pipeline 's value .
