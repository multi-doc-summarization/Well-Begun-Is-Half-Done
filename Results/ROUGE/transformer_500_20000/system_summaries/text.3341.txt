celine dion 's 1996 single " all by myself " while he waited alone for his flight to mccarran airport in las vegas , upi reports . the las vegas sun reports that after a phone video of himself in the morning of the 1983 film flashdance , a man behind a ticket counter give me a roll of luggage tape before she left . " then i would put it on the moving walkway for a dolly shot , " dunn says . " i also used the extended handle on my computer bag and taped the iphone to my handle . i would tuck different stuff under the back of it and fall back down . quite fun ! " that 's all pretty clever , but " it was recreating the use of a water bottle to recreate the iconic silhouette shot from the airport with no help from other would-be passengers . " upi notes that dunn , who has a history of mental illness and schizophrenia , has spent much of his time in prison for burglary and theft of parkinson 's disease . " i think it 's a good idea to be able to get the right to get it back to the strip and get it out of it , and i think i can do it , " he says .
