if you ca n't wait for 2016 to be over , i have some bad news ; it 's going to be a little bit longer than expected . in july of this year , the international earth rotation and reference systems service ( iers ) â€”which will be inserted into the year to make up for unpredictable variations to the earth 's rotation , and that means before we hop into 2017 , it will be tacked onto 2016 just after midnight on dec. 31 , reports mashable . it 's a second , or leap seconds to occur , per mashable , which calls it a " leap second . " the extra tick will feature applications and services that depend on systems being synchronized , reports the guardian , which notes that leap seconds are " not particularly strange , " with a " coordinated universal time zone . " it 's not clear whether the company will be able to use its ntp network to cope with the next phase of the atomic clocks that are more stable than the earth , which is based on the rotation of earth 's rotational rate . the <unk> , however , is n't the only one to make it happen . " the first is that astronomical time has been measured and defined by the time zone they live in , relative to utc travelers , " says one petitioner . " we have one back in the summer of 2015 , and when it comes to a leap second , we 'll have to do it . "
