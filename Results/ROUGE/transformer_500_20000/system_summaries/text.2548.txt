iranian protesters stormed two british diplomatic compounds in tehran on tuesday , torching a car and burning the british flag , the ap reports . " the attacks come at a time of rising diplomatic tension between iran and western nations , " said iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . " it is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it . " iran 's parliament approved a bill that reduces diplomatic relations with britain following london 's support of recently upgraded western sanctions on tehran over its disputed nuclear program . iran has a " clear duty " under international law to protect diplomats and offices , the bbc reports . the embassy storming is also a sign of deepening political infighting within iran 's ruling elites . " we are outraged by this , " the statement said . the iranian foreign office said a " significant number " of protesters entered the compound and caused vandalism , but gave no other reason to believe it was the work of the british government . iran is n't the only country in the world , but it says it is aimed at achieving the capability of making an atomic bomb .
