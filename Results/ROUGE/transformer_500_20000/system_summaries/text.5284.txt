thousands of people gathered in the emmys last night to protest the emmy awards , and some are calling it quits . " that whole # emmys , we aren â€™ t all @ andysamberg ! not everyone can lock themselves in a bunker and watch all the shows , " one user tweeted . " but there was a lack of sympathy from some who highlighted that many of the shows ended earlier this year and had been talked about widely on the internet . " " to everyone complaining about spoilers : most of those shows are nurse jackie , boardwalk empire , and sons of anarchy and mad men . " " i ca n't believe the emmys just gave away so many spoilers in that memoriam , " tweeted user ashley renee , who added that the film is " unlikely that boxset fans will be able to watch those shows with the unwitting mentality they deserve . " the awards were " dumbfounded to acknowledge that many people would be upset about the spoiler awards . " the emmys ranged in age from $ <unk> to $ <unk> , notes the los angeles times .
