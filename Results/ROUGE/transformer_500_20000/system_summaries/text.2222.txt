president trump 's national security advisor says the white house did n't give him anything to say whether president trump retains confidence in national security adviser michael flynn . " first reason , it does n't really focus on the areas where we really need to tighten up , " policy director stephen miller tells the washington post . " they did not give you anything to <unk> say , 'let 's just say , ' " he says , per politico . miller says the comment " made by the top senate democrat in an interview on face the nation with john dickerson of slate . " the president 's silence on flynn was significant because the trump administration had booked him on several of the countries blocked by the 9th circuit court of appeals . " the white <unk> , however , is n't the only one making that distinction . " i think you should ask the president , chuck todd , " schumer says , adding that it 's not up to trump 's claim that the president is looking to introduce a new executive order similar to a travel ban for majority-muslim countries . " i 'm not going to make it safer . it 's going to be a very difficult time for the president to make sure he 's confidence in him , " miller says . " he 's a very smart guy . " ( trump has previously said he 's not interested in renegotiating nafta . )
