the washington post calls it " the highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about , nor seen but , if one will , are to be lived . " alicia keys and dj walton are taking it a step further and banning phones from entering the arena with the help of a small case that makes it impossible to access the phones during a show . " the event has become as much a part of the concert-going experience as to the music starts and the phones and cameras come out — that 's what live shows are like these days , " says walton , who adds that they 're " not actually preventing them from using them . " the post notes that some artists are no fans of that habit . " like , queen latifah , " one twitter user tells the post . " and that doesn ’ t mean airplane mode . " adele says it 's a " phone-free event , " and it 's not the first time adele has been invited to work in italy . " i think it ’ s going to happen again . "
