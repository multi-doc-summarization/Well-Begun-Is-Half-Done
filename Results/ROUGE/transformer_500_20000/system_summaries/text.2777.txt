the chocolate bar 's maker , nestl√© , has spent more than a decade fighting to trademark the shape of the teatime treat . the european court of justice has thrown out an appeal by europe 's trademark group , which could bring an end to the snack 's protected european status and a saga that has proved expensive for both sides , the bbc reports . the ruling revolves around a previous court ruling that had been right to annul the decision by mondelez 's milka brand , which has been around for 80 years and opens the door to own-brand imitations at your local supermarket . the guardian notes that the luxembourg legalized the wafer shape of a wafer last year , but it 's not clear whether it will be able to reject it . the guardian reports that the ruling by the european intellectual property office of justice means the eu can review a 2012 decision to uphold nestle 's ruling . it 's also not clear how the ruling will affect nestle , who has national pride in the snack , but the guardian points out that nestle 's <unk> brand is n't so sure about it .
