" ayatollah ali khamenei , who called the deal " defective at its core , " said trump 's comments on iran 's nuclear activities amounted to a " horrible catastrophe , " reports the new york times . he said the deal would be a mistake for the us to impose sanctions on iran , china , and russia . khamenei , meanwhile , said that he would pull the us out of it , reports the bbc . " if we achieve the deal 's goals in return for the nuclear accord , we will be able to stabilize the situation , " khamenei said . " we are going to make it clear that we are not dead . " the bbc reports that the deal was struck under trump 's predecessor , barack obama , and the iranian government , which has been ratcheting up sanctions against the us and its allies . the white house says it has no comment yet on the deal , though it says it will be a moot point .
