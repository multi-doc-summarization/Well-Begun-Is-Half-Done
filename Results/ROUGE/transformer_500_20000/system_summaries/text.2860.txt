the baywatch movie need n't rescue itself from a puddle ilfenesh and dwayne johnson star in the 1990s , but it 's not all glitz and glamour . here 's what critics are saying : " no one is expecting oscar-level material here , but did it have to be this ? crude and silly , searching for the laughs in this r-rated movie , " writes peter howell at the toronto star . it 's " not enough to carry two hours on the sand , " he writes . " but it â€™ s a little bit of fun . " the film is " an ideal movie for immature , socially maladjusted males and their girlfriends . " " it is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , ' " writes kirk honeycutt in the new york times . " it 's a good idea . " but the film 's " <unk> and <unk> " is " a lot more fun than it is , " and it " makes it a hit in the face of a metal detector looking for lost items . " the movie 's director , victoria chopra , agrees , calling the film " a bit of a frankenstein , a <unk> , and a lot of people are going to have to do with the same thing . " but " there is no sense of urgency to grasp the gravity of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of the beach . " the baywatch is n't the only lifeguard to make anyone think about anything , except maybe about where to plan their next vacation . "
