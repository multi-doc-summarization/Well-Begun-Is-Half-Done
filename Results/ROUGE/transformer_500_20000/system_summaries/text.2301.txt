the government shutdown is over , and it 's going to be a big day for the government to reopen the statue of liberty in new york city , reports the new york times . the move comes after senate democratic leader harry reid floated a deal with the federal government that would allow them to avert a looming default and end a shutdown that has dragged on for 14 days . " i 'm very optimistic that we will reach an agreement that 's reasonable in nature this week , " he said , according to the hill . the deal is expected to affect the government 's negotiators , who say they 've been closing in on the deal since the end of the year . the democrats ' demand for the cuts is a tacit agreement that would defund obamacare , but the white house says it wo n't happen until after the shutdown . " it 's not going to happen , but it 's a matter of time . it 's time for us to get to work , and we 're going to have to make sure we can get a better deal , " said reid . " we have a lot of people who do n't want to do it . "
