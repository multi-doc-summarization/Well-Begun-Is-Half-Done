" it 's not clear how the ban will affect paypal 's use of the policy , but it will take a few days to find new payment processors , which have used paypal to process transactions for its on-site store . according to infowars , the company says it plans to " vigorously defend " the move , which it calls " unacceptable " and " undermines the integrity of paypal 's own terms of service. ” right wing creator alex jones , who says he has spoken to the media about the ban , says the ban is " absurd " and is " ridiculous , " and he says the decision to " diminish the value of paypal ’ s <unk> and <unk> .
