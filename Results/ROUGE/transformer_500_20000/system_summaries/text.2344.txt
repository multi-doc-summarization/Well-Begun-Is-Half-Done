the shell discovery xprize will address a critical ocean challenge by innovation to further explore one of our greatest frontiers . " teams ' creations will be tested first at 2,000 , then 4,000 meters ( about 6,500 and 13,000 feet , reports the new york times . the robots will create a high-resolution map of the planet 's surface and the air we breathe , yet 95 % of the deep sea remains a mystery to us , " says head peter diamandis in the prize 's announcement . the project is aimed at safeguarding the ocean 's gravity , and the creation of a chemical or biological signal back to the source of food , energy , economic security , and even the <unk> of our oceans . the competition is technically challenging , but it 's also very interdisciplinary . " it involves robotics and manage public competitions that better mankind , has just launched a new ocean challenge which will likely draw the attention of marine scientists who want to see a number of different approaches to this . " it 's not going to be easy to imagine what we 're going to do . "
