the house intelligence committee has voted to release a classified memo they wrote that alleges the fbi and the justice department improperly used government surveillance during the investigation into russian election interference and contacts with president trump 's campaign . that 's according to rep. adam schiff , the ranking democrat on the committee . schiff says democrats on the panel voted against releasing the memo , which was written by republicans and against making public a competing memo to give justice department and fbi more time to vet the republican document , the ap reports . the vote to release the memo comes after committee chairman devin nunes , a california republican , pushed for its disclosure in the 2016 election . the group also rejected a sign of the memo 's growing suspicions toward the trump campaign , saying it was an attempt to distract from special counsel robert mueller 's investigation into russia 's interference in the election , politico reports . " it 's not clear if the memo was used to obtain surveillance warrants , but we do n't know what it will do , " schiff says . " we do not believe that any of these allegations are related to the advancement of american intelligence and cooperation in the united states , and we are working together to make sure we are not going to interfere .
