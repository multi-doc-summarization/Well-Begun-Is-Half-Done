" we are witnessing an ongoing political struggle in the us , whose task is to undermine the legitimacy of the president-elect , " putin said , per the new york times . " one has the impression that upon gaining the required experience they may go as far as staging maidan type of impropriety . " he added that those behind the claims were " worse than prostitutes . " " i have an impression they practiced in kiev and are ready to organize a maidan in washington , just to not let trump take office , " he told reporters . the ap notes that the dossier made public last week , with the ap reporting that the russian ambassador to france , france , and the us delegation at the g20 summit in new york . putin , who has said that the " media frenzy surrounding trump has been unable to stand up for debate , " tweeted the president , who called the protests a " sham . " the ap reports that trump , who is believed to be in the 70s of the trump campaign , said he was surprised to see trump as a " <unk> , " adding that " the people who have been doing that really wish it or not , they do cause harm to the interests of the united states and that harm is enormous , " per the ap .
