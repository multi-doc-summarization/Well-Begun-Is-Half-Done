the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization has circulated a list of 70 artworks stolen from the national museum of fine arts in havana , cnn reports . according to unesco , the theft of at least 70 works of art from the island nation with a value of more than $ 1 million . " the theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of cuba , " unesco says in a statement . " to just get the art out of the museum is very complicated . " cuban authorities have not said whether any arrests have been made , but a statement from the us art dealer says the case was notable because the theft was relatively rare in cuba . museums are tightly guarded and artwork is usually inspected before it leaves the country . the national council of cultural heritage says it is investigating the theft and will likely be transferred to a $ 1.5 million fine . the art dealer , who first reported the heist in february , says it was registered to havana 's national museum and fine arts after it was discovered after a 20th-century artist for $ 15,000 .
