president obama and attorney general loretta lynch have been feuding over the watergate era , and they 're not sure what they 're going to do with it . in a letter to the president , the former chief counsel of the 1970s church committee , led by frederick schwarz , that " there is no question that edward snowden 's disclosures led to public awareness which stimulated reform . whether or not these clear benefits to the country merit a pardon , they surely do counsel for leniency , " the letter asserts , per the washington post . snowden has been living in russia since he fled the us via hong kong in 2013 , and the cia says it is working on a plea deal to allow the nsa to return home to the us , reports the new york times . " we 're not going to be complicit in the espionage of leaking classified documents to the press , " says green , a former church committee chair . " it 's a violation of secret service policy , and it 's the responsibility of the nsa and other intelligence agencies . " the church , meanwhile , accuses the cia of trying to sabotage snowden 's claim that snowden was a catalyst for the nsa 's spying on the nsa , the guardian reports .
