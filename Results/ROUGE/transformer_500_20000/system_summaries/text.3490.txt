" our tilt accuracy of better than 10âˆ’8 , measured over 35 km , demonstrates loch ness as one the world 's longest and most accurate tiltmeters , " researcher philip woodworth tells the guardian . the researchers say the tide is so subtle that gps could n't even track it . the study , published in the proceedings of the national oceanography center , says the team is trying to figure out how the tides are going to happen , but it may be the first time a european lake has been shifting away from land to ocean loading , reports nature world news . it 's not clear what triggered the discovery .
