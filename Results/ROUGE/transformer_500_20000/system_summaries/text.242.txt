the concept of " the hardest test you â€™ ve never heard , " as the new york times puts it . in a letter to all master sommeliers , the board of directors of the court of master sommeliers says it will invalidate the results of one portion of this year 's examination . the suffix is the crowning achievement of a career that began in 1969 , when 273 people have ever passed the test , the guardian reports . the suffix itself has been used for generations , but it 's not clear whether it will be worthwhile for the rest of the world , but the researchers say they 're still trying to figure out what 's going on in the future . " we have a lot of data that we have , " the lead researcher tells the times . " we 're not going to have to do that . " the suffix for wine stewards is " known throughout the hospitality industry , " he says . " we are not aware of the gravity of the flight , but we are still assembling the most sommelier taste in the world . " in the meantime , the researchers have found a correlation between the two of the wines that passed the 1969 test , and they say they 've found no evidence of a master sommeliers in the field of computer-generated <unk> , the times reports . the board says the suffix " must be diminishing the value of , and the respect of the earned from , becoming a master sommelier , " but it does n't appear to be the case . " it 's a mistake , " says devon broglie , who co-authored the study .
