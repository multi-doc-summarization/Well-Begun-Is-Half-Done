the state of alaska is releasing thousands of emails from sarah palin 's first two years as governor of the last frontier . the emails were first requested during the 2008 white house race , and the state has scheduled to release 24,199 pages of emails in alaska 's capital , accessible by only air or water , reports the new york times . it 's not clear how many of the emails will be distributed , but it 's still not clear whether they 'll be able to take some of the messages . " every rock " that could have been kicked over to the sheer volume of the release and the flood of requests , says palin , who has been criticized by the media for publishing truthful information about the emails . " i think it 's a good idea , " she says . " i do n't think it was going to happen . " she adds that she 's " very disappointed " that she 'll be " flabbergasted " to learn that she has n't been able to find a new chief executive of the faraway state . she says she has no recollection of being a member of the " <unk> " of her husband , who was a volunteer at the university of texas . she says that when she was asked to dig up the emails , she was surprised by the reaction was " a lot of embarrassment " and a " very sad " move .
