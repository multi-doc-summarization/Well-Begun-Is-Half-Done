janet yellen 's first press conference as federal reserve chairman was asked how long the fed would wait after the tapering ends before it begins to raise interest rates , the washington post reports . " the language that we used in the statement is ‘ considerable ’ so i , you know , probably means something on the order of around six , ' " she said . " but , you ’ re dying to know that it ’ s hard to define . " the fed has repeatedly refused to be pinned down , but it 's not clear whether yellen will go on as fed chief , reuters reports . " the more experienced [ ben ] bernanke knew to avoid deliberately clarifying language , " says michael feroli , chief economist of jpmorgan chase . " in policy terms , she 's on the side of the angels : passionately committed to getting the economy growing and bringing down unemployment , particularly for the long-term jobless , who have been the biggest victims of the great recession . " the post points out that yellen 's talks at a news conference last month was n't the first time that she has been eating out of her hands since 2008 .
