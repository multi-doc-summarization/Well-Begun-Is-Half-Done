the minnesota department of human services has filed a lawsuit against the couple of kids who adopt native american children . the couple , who worked to keep their pregnancy a secret , say they 're putting their own interests above the rights of the child , who would be better served with an indian family , fox23 reports . " i do n't know what they 're trying to accomplish , " says an attorney for the mille band of ojibwe to allow the adoption to go forward . it 's not the first time the baby has been removed from the only stable home in the us since 2013 . the lawsuit , filed last week , seeks to keep indian families in indian families . the couple are seeking a $ 25,000 fine , but they want the court to throw out the state 's requirement that they tell the tribe about the baby 's constitutional right to due process and equal protection . advocates say the laws were an attempt to remedy the tradition of breaking up indian families by sending their children into institutions or to non-indian adoptive parents . the minnesota attorney general and a commissioner with the lacs band say the adoption of the baby is a " slap in the face " of the 14th 14th american children in the state . it 's a quandary for the couple 's children to adopt the baby , and their mother says it 's " very sad " to see the couple in their 20s .
