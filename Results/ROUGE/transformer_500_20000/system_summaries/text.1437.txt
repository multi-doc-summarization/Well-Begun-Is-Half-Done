scientists do n't know if they are the smallest bits of matter in existence , but a new study suggests that space itself is n't continuous and smooth , but is actually made closer to one part than another . researchers at england 's cambridge university report in the journal horizon : how small is the universe ? " strings or points ? in experiments , teensy , tiny particles like quarks and electrons seem to act like single points of matter with no spatial distribution , " says physicist andy parker . " have we reached the most fundamental layer of matter ? " the theory is that the theory could solve some of the problems of the universe , and the researchers say that if the theory goes , " it would be impossible to see any evidence at all that there 's anything inside quarks . " the study , published in bbc science , is based on a number of theories , including the possibility that it might be correct , reports the telegraph . " if quarks and are indivisible , " the team says . " it 's very likely to solve the mystery . "
