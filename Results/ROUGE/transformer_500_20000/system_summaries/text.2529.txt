the british library has announced a theory of a more dramatic sort : what if not cancer or faulty glands , did in the author of sense and sensibility ? if so , it would be the first time a tainted water assassin has died , reports the washington post . jane austen was 41 and her portable writing desk was inherited by her sister , cassandra austen , in 1999 . the arsenic likely came from an optical , with a lensmeter to measure their strength , and their specialist staff undertook the tests . " the birmingham optical supplied us with lensmeter and spectacles in the british conservation centre was involved from the start , to ensure that no harm would come to them , " says the library 's website . the library has yet to comment on the cause of austen 's death , but it 's not clear whether the library was involved in the attacks . " the optical illusion of a tainted substance is that it is , of course , that foul plot nor assassin . " the post notes that austen may have been suffering from facial aches and fever .
