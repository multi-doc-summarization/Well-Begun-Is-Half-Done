a jewish student who suffered the injury told the guardian that a student 's nose was broken . " i 've seen this kind of game before , so it was n't so much the game that offended me , " jay stoll , president of the jewish society , said in a statement . " there is simply no context for what has happened here . those who believe the game was all in our universities , which should remain safe spaces for all students . " the game played a nazi-themed version of the drinking game of fire , and players were required to abide by clear standards of behaviour set by both the lse and the su and breaches of those standards are taken very seriously . we do not tolerate antisemitism or any other form of racism . " the guardian reports that the student newspaper , whose name is spiteful and collective attack on a community , says it 's " no joke . " the beaver , which has been criticized by the students ' union , says that while it has been viewed more than 100 times as a result of a skiing trip to the university 's athletics union , the students are prepared to take disciplinary action if the allegations are shown to be true .
