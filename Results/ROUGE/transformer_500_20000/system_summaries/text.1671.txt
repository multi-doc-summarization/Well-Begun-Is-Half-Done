the president of palau has proposed a new law that will allow only five-star hotels to open up on its islands , the bbc reports . tommy remengesau , a remote republic in oceania , is renowned for its coral and desert islands , but he says he wanted to encourage high-end hotels that would come in with " the necessary tax breaks and exemptions , " the guardian reports . " if there are any other infrastructures that they have to do , like opening a road , the investor would do that , " remengesau says . " it ’ s kind of a win-win situation for palau and the investor. ” the law focuses on " quality rather than quantity , " according to the bbc , which notes that locals have complained about an influx of visitors , including coral reefs , ports , and wildlife , and the area 's infrastructure , which is located about 30 miles from where overcrowding is affecting coral reefs . palau says the plan is to cut the number of tourists who flock to the pacific island for about a year , and it 's not clear how long it will affect the hotels . the government is hoping to attract more visitors to the hotel , where they 're being held by the government for their assistance , the guardian notes .
