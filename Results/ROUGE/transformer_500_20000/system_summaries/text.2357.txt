president trump traveled to the midwest on wednesday for a raucous political rally in iowa , rejecting a russia investigation as a witch hunt and saying he was succeeding against all odds , reuters reports . " all we do is win , win , " he said . " they have n't figured it out yet . " he also applauded republican ralph norman , who notched a slimmer-than-expected win in a special election to fill the south carolina congressional seat vacated by mick mulvaney , and mocked handel 's challenger , jon ossoff , saying the democrats " spent $ 30 million on this kid who forgot to live in the district . " " the truth is , people love us , " trump , no stranger to achievements , said in front of a boisterous crowd that packed a downtown arena . he also called for a referendum on his presidency in washington , dc , and the washington post reports that trump 's approval rating is below 40 % in most polls . the post notes that trump has been trying to gain traction in the past and has been criticized by both sides of the aisle .
