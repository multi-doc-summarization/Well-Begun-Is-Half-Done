a professor at germany 's oldest universities has apologized for denying an internship to an indian student because of the rape problem in india . annette beck-sickinger , the professor at leipzig university , and the german ambassador strongly condemned the incident , reports the guardian . " while any professor would be concerned for the safety of her students ( both male and female ) , what with the idea of denying indian male opportunities for higher education in europe as a 'carrot ' for social engineering . and a gigantic false consensus - as if all european 'female professors ' would fall into her line , based on her faulty and illogical presumptuousness . plus , the whole characterisation of india as a potential rapist sounds unbecoming of someone of her station . " i sincerely apologise to everyone whose feelings i have hurt , " beck-sickinger said in a statement . " i have been holding off answering this question for a while , as there are some missing pieces in this puzzle . " he added : " thank you for the a2a . " the professor says he 's " unable to solve it 's " rape problem , " but he 's not sure what he 's talking about .
