ron paul is n't the only candidate running for president , but he 's got a lot of attention . the new york times takes a look at paul 's views on israel certainly place him outside the american , never mind republican , mainstream , and jewish organizations . " we are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men , it is hardly irrational , " he said . " after the los angeles riots , one article in a newsletter claimed , order was only restored to the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal . " he also called the criminal justice system , i think we can safely assume that 95 % of the black men in that <unk> city are <unk> . " the wall street journal , meanwhile , has a profile of paul on the tonight show with jay leno on monday , and it 's not clear whether he 'll have to write it , but the new republic points out that he 's a staunch supporter of foreign policy , and that he has n't spoken to any of those who do n't like him . " while paul â€™ s views on <unk> certainly <unk> him , there is an even more elementary reason to draw boundaries around acceptable policy discourse than any active concern that president ron paul would be actively anti-israel or anti-semitic , " writes matt welch at the atlantic .
