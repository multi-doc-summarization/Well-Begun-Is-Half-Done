" we do apologize for failing to make this clear when the piece was posted , " reads a statement from bwog 's board on thursday . " in addition , we were tipped that there are “ rape list flyers ” in the past six days , the new york daily news reports . the first list has been discovered in a women 's stall in hamilton , texas , where they were allegedly assaulted by media outlets . a tipster emailed a photo of the rapists entering the bathroom of a second-floor women 's bathroom , and the photo quickly spread . the photo , posted on facebook , shows an image of a woman holding a sign reading , " i am not going to be surprised to see what happened to me . " it 's not clear what caused the rapists to be in the custody of the police department or the editorial board as a result of the vandalism . the board says it will review the use of the word " legitimate " because it " only reflects the opinions of its authors and not of bwog itself . " in the meantime , bwog has been posting more details on the case .
