for more than 40 years , deborah giannecchini used johnson & johnson baby powder and other talcum powder products—and on thursday , a st. louis jury awarded more than $ 70 million in damages on her claim , the st. louis post-dispatch reports . the 63-year-old californian said those j & j products contributed to her developing ovarian cancer . the jury voted against j & j 10-2—one of the dissenters actually did n't think the award was enough—with an award of $ 575,000 in medical damages , $ 2 million in compensatory damages , $ 2.5 million in compensatory damages against imerys talc ( the producer of the talcum powder ) , and $ 65 million in punitive damages against j & j . about half of the punitive damages will go to the missouri crime victims ' compensation program , per jim onder of onder law , which has handled all three cases with awarded damages so far . memos from inside j & j show the company knew for decades about research tying the use of talc powder to ovarian cancer , onder says—though cnbc says " much " of that research has been " weak . " giannecchini , however , had no clue of possible risks . " there is n't a way to describe how you feel ... when you 're told you probably wo n't make it beyond the next year , " she says of receiving her stage 4 cancer diagnosis in 2012 . per her lawyers , giannecchini has about an 80 % chance of dying within the next two years , bloomberg reports . not that onder expects j & j to cede to the nearly 2,000 state and federal complaints against it ; instead , he believes the company will take a " scorched-earth legal policy " and not settle " until they absolutely have to . " in a statement , a j & j rep says the company will appeal because it 's " guided by the science , which supports the safety of johnson 's baby powder . "
