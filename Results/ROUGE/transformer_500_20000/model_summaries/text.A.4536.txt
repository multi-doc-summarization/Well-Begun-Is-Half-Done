north korea 's economy may not be growing , but one of its prison camps sure seems to be . new satellite photos show that camp 25 , thought to house about 5,000 of the 200,000 people believed to be held in north korea 's gulags , has grown steadily over the past decade , reports the washington post . its perimeter grew 37 % between just 2009 and 2010 , according to the committee for human rights in north korea , which says new buildings , guard posts , and fields have been added . experts are unsure whether the expansion of camp 25 signals an overall growth in political prisoners in north korea or a move to accommodate existing prisoners as other camps are downsized . " it appears that north korea 's vast system of unlawful imprisonment may be undergoing an alteration involving the consolidation of some of its political prison camps , and the expansion of others , " said the executive director of the committee , according to yonhap news .
