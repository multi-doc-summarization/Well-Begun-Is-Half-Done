" that new soda tax in seattle is working out about as well as chicago 's , " proclaims a headline at hot air . it 's not a compliment . the tax , which went into effect jan. 1 , slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks , a group that includes soda , sports drinks , and kombucha . that 's nearly double the one-cent levy the chicago-encompassing cook county tried , a tax it repealed after about two months . the chicago tribune reported at the time that costco 's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34 % , while sales jumped 38 % at locations just beyond the county line . and costco is again at the fore of what 's happening : because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one , the impact is starker , as kiro discovered when it spotted an updated costco sign for gatorade in seattle . the sign details costco 's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles— $ 15.99—and separately lists the city 's $ 10.34 tax , for a new total of $ 26.33 . but that 's not all the sign says : it also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax . the tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures , but the blog for citizens against government waste sees the ends quite differently : " let ’ s be clear . soda taxes don ’ t make people healthier . they do n't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits . they don ’ t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer . " but some in government seemingly remain hopeful : kxly reports a bill was reintroduced monday that would push the tax statewide . ( speaking of seattle and beverages , the world 's largest starbucks is no longer located there . )
