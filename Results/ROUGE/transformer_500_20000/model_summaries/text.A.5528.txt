mitch daniels has some advice for those who are writing rick perry 's political eulogy : hold your horses . " it 's way too early to know , or to issue , to pronounce last rites over one performance , " daniels said today . " there 's still many of these ( debates ) , too many maybe . ... i 'd cut him some slack and give him a little time . " politico notes that daniels also had kind words for democrat sen. mark warner 's work on the gang of six , saying , " it 's very encouraging , by the way , to hear a guy like sen. warner speak to it as clearly as he just did . i wish he were president . " more fun on your sunday dial , as per politico : michael bloomberg on president obama 's 2012 chances : " he would be a credible , formidable candidate . you 're going to have a real horse race no matter who the republican nominee is . " reince priebus to debbie wasserman schultz on 2012 : " it sounds like the new slogan is no longer 'hope and change . ' it 's , 'hey , it could 've been worse . ' great bumper sticker debbie , i hope it works for you . " david plouffe on a white house shakeup : " i do n't expect that . " obama is " confident in his team , in the direction we 've laid out here . " warner on congress ' standoff over a short-term spending bill : " it is embarrassing . the senate is saying , 'why should we build schools in iraq on the credit card but expect that rebuilding schools in joplin , mo. , ' " will be paid for . warner blames " a group , more centered in the house , in terms of some of these tea party republicans , who say on every issue , 'we 're going to make this a make-or-break . ' " lindsey graham on pakistan : " we need to put pakistan on notice . we 're going to have to put all options on the table . including defending our troops . it 's now a time of choosing , so i hope they choose wisely .
