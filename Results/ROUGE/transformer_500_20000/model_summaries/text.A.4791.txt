ever wondered what a young ted cruz looked and sounded like ( and no worries , no princess bride impersonations ) ? a circulating youtube video , which politico says was apparently provided by a high school classmate , purports to show the 18-year-old gop candidate mulling his future . " aspirations ? is that like sweat on my butt ? " cruz ponders in the video—which raw story says was shot for his baptist high school in houston in 1988—before offering up his first goal to " be in a teen tit film . " upon further reflection , however , cruz realizes he should set the bar higher . " well , other than that , uh , take over the world , world domination , you know , rule everything , " he notes . " rich , powerful , that sort of stuff . " although some reviews of the video are n't terribly flattering—raw story labels young ted cruz " irritating and horrible , " while gawker calls his less-mature self an " insufferable twerp " —cruz 's campaign spokesman tells politico : " good to see he 's always had a great sense of humor . " ( mother jones documents cruz 's various beefs with people to see if he 's really an " awful , terrible jerk . " )
