the way to increase test scores is not to give bonuses to teachers , say researchers at vanderbilt university . a three-year study found that offers of bonuses as high as $ 15,000 did little to change results . the report leaves open the question of what will increase test scores , but it casts doubt on the notion of merit pay , one of the solutions being pushed by the obama administration . “ i think most people agree today that the current way in which we compensate teachers is broken , " says the lead researcher . " but we don ’ t know what the better way is yet. ” the american federation of teachers agrees with the study and says training is one of the key factors that needs to be improved . story here and from ap here .
