a former tesla technician continues to cause headaches for ceo elon musk . " are you ready ? " martin tripp tweeted wednesday before unleashing internal documents and photos he alleges show scrap piles , " bent " cooling tubes , and " reworked " m3 battery modules at tesla 's battery factory in nevada , backing his claims of dangerous practices , per business insider . ( his twitter account was down as of thursday morning , with gizmodo reporting he had received a 12-hour suspension , ostensibly after tweeting elon musk 's email address . ) before his account was suspended , tripp also shared dozens of vehicle identification numbers of cars built with what he says are " punctured/dented/damaged " battery cells , allegedly the result of a robot that malfunctioned in february . " this is how @ elonmusk and his business operates . he 's taking money and fooling everyone , " added tripp , who is suing his former employer for defamation . " as we 've said before , these claims are false , " a tesla rep tells cnbc . " no punctured cells have ever been used in any model 3 vehicles in any way , and all vins that have been identified have safe batteries . " yet tripp isn â€™ t the only ex-employee making such claims . per business insider , former tesla engineer cristina balan says she was silenced and left the company in 2014 after airing concerns about design flaws , part defects , and waste . " as soon as the model s came out the door and elon realized how cool he 'd become , everything went down the drain , " she says .
