do n't be too nervous if you were in lithia , fla. , earlier in the week and spotted a ups truck launching a device from its roof to a nearby blueberry farm . it was all part of a test of a new drone-delivery feature the company hopes to bring to residential areas , consumerist reports . the workhorse group 's horsefly unit—which can buzz along for about a half-hour , carrying packages that do n't exceed 10 pounds—traveled a quarter-mile or so from the truck to the farm , dropped off its package , then circled back to find the ups truck , on its way to a new destination . techcrunch reviewed the test runs and said the process " still needs work , " noting that interference caused one launch to be aborted . reuters reports the experiment followed on the tail of a ups announcement that automation and new technology were high on the company 's priority list . mark wallace , a ups senior vp , explains to consumerist that rural areas could be a particularly viable place for the truck-launched drones , as a truck could settle in the middle of a " triangular delivery route " and send the drone to different destinations . another ups exec , john dodero , tells reuters that there 's no set timeline for getting the drones into wider circulation because federal regulations are in flux . faa rules , for example , currently require commercial drones to stay in operators ' view , and they can only buzz over their operators , not other people . ( inc. notes the risk to those below if the drone malfunctions and drops the package . ) one thing dodero can speak clearly to : " ups is never looking to replace our ups drivers , " he tells reuters . ( amazon has also been experimenting with drone delivery . )
