us news says he " appeared to get irritated , " while politico and nbc note he was being sarcastic , but if russian foreign minister sergey lavrov did n't know about president trump firing fbi director james comey before wednesday morning 's presser at the state department , he does now . lavrov , who 's in town to meet with trump , appeared with secretary of state rex tillerson when msnbc reporter andrea mitchell asked , " does the comey firing cast a shadow over the talks , gentlemen ? " that sent tillerson to the door while lavrov lingered . " was he fired ? " he asked . " you 're kidding—you 're kidding ! " lavrov made a dismissive gesture with his head and exited the room with tillerson . per the state department , lavrov 's sit-down with trump on wednesday was to focus on syria , the conflict in ukraine , and " bilateral issues , " usa today reports . npr notes that even though the lavrov-trump meeting was closed to the us press , russian agencies tweeted pictures of trump with lavrov and also with russian ambassador sergey kislyak , who was not mentioned on the original itinerary . when the american media was allowed into the oval office , they found trump sitting with richard nixon 's secretary of state , henry kissinger—also a surprise appearance . meanwhile , putin spokesman dmitry peskov said he did n't think the comey firing would impact the us-russia relationship , calling it an " independent decision " by trump that " has nothing to do and should have nothing to do with russia , " per the tass news agency .
