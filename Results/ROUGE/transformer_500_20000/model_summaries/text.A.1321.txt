a visit by george w. bush to switzerland later this month has been called off because the host charity says it feared leftist protests would get out of hand . human rights groups , meanwhile , say the real reason is because they planned to lodge a criminal complaint against bush accusing him of sanctioning torture , reports reuters . bush had been scheduled to speak to a jewish group feb. 12 in geneva , and an attorney for the group says the potential legal action played no role in the decision to cancel , notes the hill . " we did n't want to put people and property in geneva at risk , " he said , citing plans by protesters to arrive en masse . a spokesman for human rights watch had a different take : " he 's avoiding the handcuffs . " noting that bush acknowledged in his memoir that he approved waterboarding , " authorities would have been obliged to open an investigation and either prosecute or extradite " him , said the spokesman .
