italians are a wee bit upset about an armalite ad that shows a massive $ 3,000 rifle cradled in the arms of michelangelo 's david , the bbc reports . " the image of david , armed , offends and infringes the law , " tweeted culture minister dario franceschini . he vowed to take action against the illinois-based small arms company for its ar-50a1 rifle ad , which reads " a work of art " along the top . a gallery director in florence noted that the law forbids distorting a work of art 's aesthetic value : " in this case , not only is the choice in bad taste but also completely illegal . " " it is an act of violence towards the sculpture ; like taking a hammer to it and perhaps , actually , even worse , " said a city councilor in florence , reports the guardian . but italian art critic philippe daverio pooh-poohed the uproar , comparing armalite 's ad to cheeky images of a mustached mona lisa : " certain cultural icons belong to everyone and no one ; to humanity in general , " he said . if true , that 's good news for armalite , which has another ad showing its ar-301a on a museum wall between american gothic and the mona lisaâ€”pointed at mona lisa 's head , the wire reports .
