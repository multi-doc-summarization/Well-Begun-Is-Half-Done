all new lawyers in california will soon have to make an added promise when joining the bar—to be nice to one another , the san francisco chronicle reports . beginning may 23 , the oath one takes to " faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney " will be joined by language stating the lawyer " will strive to conduct myself at all times with dignity , courtesy , and integrity . " the added language was oked thursday by the california supreme court at the urging of a former state bar president , who over his 45 years in the industry has found lawyers ' bad behavior—swearing at peers , attacking each other in court filings , and bullying judges—on the rise . the civility oath will remind lawyers that the profession is n't just about winning cases , says patrick kelly . but as there 's no penalty for breaking said promise , legal ethics experts wonder if it will deter such conduct at all . " it ’ s a reminder of positive professional behavior , rather than a stick , " says a court rep . the pledge may not be unique to california for long . the american board of trial advocates is campaigning to take the oath nationwide , the los angeles times reports .
