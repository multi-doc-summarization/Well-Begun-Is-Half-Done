san diego 's city council has closed a loophole that allowed partygoers to dodge a ban on drinking on the beach by boozing just offshore instead . wording in the original ban defined beach as land only , leading to " floatopia " parties which saw thousands of people drinking on rafts and inner tubes just a few feet offshore , the los angeles times reports . the updated law now says " bathers " need to be one marine league—around 3.5 miles—offshore before they can drink alcohol . city leaders say the floating parties were a disaster waiting to happen , and even partygoers say the law probably is n't such a bad idea . " unfortunately , it makes sense , " a college student taking to his air mattress for a final few beers told the wall street journal . " floating ? drinking ? that 's just not going to work out . "
