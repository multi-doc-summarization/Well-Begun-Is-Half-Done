on a november 2004 morning in texas , candice anderson was driving her fiance , mikale erickson , to pick up his car from a friend 's house when her saturn ion failed to negotiate a slight curve , went off the road , and hit a tree . the airbags did not deploy and there were no skid marks ; erickson was killed , and anderson barely survived . she had a trace amount of xanax in her system at the time , and though there were no other drugs nor alcohol present , authorities charged her with intoxication manslaughter . she ultimately pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and served five years ' probation , though she always wondered what caused the accident—she has no memory of the day . late last month , she found out : erickson 's death is one of the 13 gm has linked to its faulty ignition switches ; the car had lost power , which would have also disabled the airbags . " it 's been a question if i was at fault for his death , and i 've carried it for so long , " anderson tells cbs news . " every part of my life 's been affected from it . " last month , erickson 's mother , rhonda , explained to the new york times that she had initially been angry with her son , who was 25 at the time , and anderson , who was 21 , assuming their recklessness ( they had both experimented with recreational drugs , possibly as recently as the night prior to the accident ) was the cause of the accident . but now she knows the truth—she wrote to the national highway traffic safety administration to have it confirmed—and she believes anderson 's record should be cleared . both women also want an apology from gm , which never contacted the erickson family to assume responsibility for the crash .
