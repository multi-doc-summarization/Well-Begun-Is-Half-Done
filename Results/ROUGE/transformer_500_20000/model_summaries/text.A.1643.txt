imagine life without electricity or running water , and you 'll understand what nearly befell our planet two years ago . scientists say that on july 23 , 2012 , the sun belched its biggest solar flare in more than 150 years and barely missed us , cbs news reports . a week earlier and the storm would have struck earth on its orbit with " catastrophic " effects , nasa says , blacking out radios , damaging satellite communications and gps , and " disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket . " such a flare would n't hurt human life directly , and the southern and northern lights would be gorgeous , but the blast 's mix of x-rays , extreme uv radiation , energetic particles , and massive clouds of magnetized plasma would cause an estimated $ 2 trillion in damage . it would also leave " large parts of society " crippled for months or years while workers replaced major transformers and substations , extremetech reports . the sun , on an 11-year solar-storm cycle , has nearly done this before : a massive storm called the " carrington event " struck earth in 1859 but could n't inflict much electrical damage in the age of steam engines ( telegraph lines did spark and set fire ) , and a pretty powerful storm caused blackouts across quebec in 1989 . one physicist says there 's a 12 % chance of a big solar blast hitting us over the next decade , which he calls a " sobering figure . " another is quoted in the guardian saying how lucky we are that the blast was n't in sync with our orbit : " earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did , " he says . " we 'd still be picking up the pieces . " ( read about the sun 's newly discovered " long-lost brother . " )
