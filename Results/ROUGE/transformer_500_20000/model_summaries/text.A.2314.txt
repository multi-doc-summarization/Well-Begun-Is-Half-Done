the ap reports that president trump hit the links on his florida golf course the day after thanksgiving , but before he did , he rehashed a topic that 's long been on his mind , with seeming impatience . " republicans and democrats must come together , finally , with a major border security package , which will include funding for the wall , " he tweeted , referring to the border barrier he wants erected between the us and mexico . " after 40 years of talk , it is finally time for action . fix the border , for once and for all , now ! " the hill notes there 's a dec. 7 deadline congress must meet to fund the remaining parts of government that are still not funded , and trump has said he 'd be ok with shutting down the government if the wall is n't included in any upcoming funding packages . " could there be a shutdown ? there certainly could , and it will be about border security , of which the wall is a part , " the president told reporters thursday , per reuters , which notes democrats , who just gained control of the house in the midterms , may now be less amenable to giving in to trump on this matter . ( trump also threatened he could shut down " the whole border " if he had to . )
