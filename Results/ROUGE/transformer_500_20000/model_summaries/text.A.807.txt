people who stand on glass bridges should n't swing sledgehammers , right ? not so , says the chinese government , at least when it comes to the zhangjiajie grand canyon bridgeâ€”the highest , longest glass bridge in the world , according to mashable . in fact , the operators of the bridge allowed dan simmons of bbc click to take a sledgehammer to the glass-bottom bridge that , per the china national tourism office , spans more than 1,400 feet ( it points out the grand canyon skywalk measures only 69 ) and is suspended some 1,000 feet above the ground . simmons ' first whack resulted in cracking to the top of a glass panel . but after a dozen blows , the lower two layers were unscathed . the stunt was an attempt to prove the safety of glass bridges after a glass-bottom skywalk in china was closed last year due to cracking that had tourists scrambling to get off of the more than 3,280-foot-high structure . the cracks to a glass panel were caused by a dropped thermos , per the south china morning post . the new bridge , which is 20 feet wide and capable of holding up to 800 people at once , is set to open to the public in july , per abc , which adds that " those wishing for an even more terrifying adventure " may someday be able to bungee jump from the structure .
