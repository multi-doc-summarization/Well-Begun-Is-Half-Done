house democratic leader nancy pelosi on thursday rejected the idea of paying for president trump 's border wall in exchange for helping hundreds of thousands of young immigrants avoid deportation . funding for the wall—a top trump priority—and legal protections for so-called dreamers , a key democratic goal , should not be linked , pelosi said . " they 're two different subjects , " and most democrats consider the wall " immoral , ineffective , and expensive , " pelosi said . her comments came as the house and senate approved a stopgap bill thursday to keep the government funded through dec. 21 , the ap reports . the measure , approved by voice votes in near-empty chambers , now goes to the white house . trump has promised to sign the two-week extension to allow for ceremonies this week honoring former president george hw bush , who died nov. 30 . but he wants the next funding package to include at least $ 5 billion for his proposed wall , something democrats have rejected . trump is set to meet tuesday at the white house with pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer . schumer said thursday that a bipartisan senate plan for $ 1.6 billion in border security funding does not include money for the 30-foot-high concrete wall trump has envisioned . in a tweet late thursday , trump warned of the potential for " big danger " at the us-mexico border in arizona , demanding , " nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall ! " ( trump says he is " totally willing " to shut down the government if funding for the wall is not approved . )
