a mean-looking cockroach that lived alongside the dinosaurs had a long neck , swiveling head , and elongated legs that enabled it to surprise prey , new scientist reports via gizmodo . found embedded in amber in myanmar , the 100-million-year-old insect resembles a cross between a roach , a crane fly , and a praying mantis : " after the first look i knew it was something new , " slovak scientist peter vršanský tells the bbc . " nothing similar runs on earth today . " vršanský and german colleague günter bechly , who revealed the appetizing bug together in the journal geologica carpathica , say it likely hunted at night . " this little monster was a solitary hunter , able to run very fast , with a body unlike the vast majority of cockroaches living today , " explains vršanský . it " frequently " took flight and grabbed prey " with strong short spines developed on its extremely long feet , " he adds . called manipulator modificaputis , it also had an extra set of eyes on top of its head , probably to spot predators like feathered dinosaurs . on the stomach-settling side , it measured less than half an inch long . so it 's not as scary as other insect predators back then , like the raphidiomimidae—which were " especially drastic and brutal , " vršanský says . they were bug-eating roaches " with a wingspan up to 20cm [ nearly 8 inches ] and eyes divided into two parts . " but compare that to aegirocassis benmoulae , a 7-foot " bizarre sea creature " 480 million years ago that is an ancient cockroach relative and caught plankton like a whale , the la times reports . ( or read about an ancient , fearsome sea creature with " curved teeth the size of bananas . " )
