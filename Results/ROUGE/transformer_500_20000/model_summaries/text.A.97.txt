even those not paying close attention to the world series might be hearing the name kyle schwarber being thrown around a lot after the first two games . as in , " the legend of kyle schwarber " as the chicago cubs catcher puts it , per usa today . the 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on april 7 and sat out the rest of the year . in a surprise move , the cubs put him back in the lineup for the world series as a designated hitter . after doubling in game 1—one of the few bright spots for the cubs that game , which came after tv analyst pete rose predicted he 'd strike out three times—schwarber had two rbi singles in the cubs ' game 2 victory and scored another run himself . he 's batting .429 with two walks . " they 're going to make movies about him , " says teammate kris bryant . no position player has ever recorded his first hit of the season in the world series . and his " eye " at the plate is astonishing his teammates , notes the chicago tribune . the problem for the cubs is that schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield , but that could change before friday 's game in chicago , where no designated hitter is allowed . but " the next plot twist— “ will schwarbs be in left field ? '—likely will not be a twist at all , " writes ken rosenthal at fox sports . " he will be in left . he will receive a standing ovation for the ages . he will hit a ball into lake michigan , and then ride a chariot down michigan avenue , woe to any billy goat that stands in the way .
