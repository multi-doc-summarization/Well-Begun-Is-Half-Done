iran today denied reports that an explosion had ripped through its fordow nuclear site , which is buried 300 feet underground and considered safe from air strikes , the telegraph and reuters report . " the false news of an explosion at fordow is western propaganda ahead of nuclear negotiations to influence their process and outcome , " state media quoted a nuclear official as saying . seems the story started on a right-wing website called wnd , which attributed it to an unnamed " former intelligence officer " in iranâ€”but that has n't quelled speculation entirely . " any explosion in iran that does n't hurt people but hurts its assets is welcome , " said israel 's defense minister . and an israeli foreign policy expert said iran may have cooked up the story to keep inspectors from entering fordow . after all , the story broke right after iranian state media reported that talks could resume between tehran and western powers , although the eu quickly said no such agreement existed . also note that fordow started making uranium at 20 % fissile purity in 2011 , far higher than the 3.5 % needed at nuclear energy plants .
