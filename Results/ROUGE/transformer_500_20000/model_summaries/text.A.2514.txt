" but the condemnation was bipartisan ; obama campaign director jim messina said he " could not disagree with hilary rosen any more strongly , " while david axelrod said he was " disappointed " by her comments . but rosen has n't backed down . " spare me the faux anger , " she wrote on the huffington post . she explained that she had nothing against stay-at-home moms , but " that is not a choice that most women have in america today . "
