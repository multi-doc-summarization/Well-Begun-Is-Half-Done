well , that did n't last long . three judges and a sloppily filled-in ballot have erased shelly simonds ' dramatic one-vote virginia house win that made headlines tuesday , the new york times reports . republican incumbent david yancey held a 10-vote lead after election day for virginia 's 94th house district . but a recount tuesday gave challenger simonds a one-vote win and democrats a 50-50 tie in the virginia house . the recount ended 17 years of republican control in the virginia house , the washington post notes . but on wednesday , republicans took the recount result to court over a ballot that had been discarded by election officials during the recount , the virginian-pilot reports . the problem : bubbles for both yancey and simonds had been filled in . judges on wednesday ruled the ballot should be counted as a vote for yancey . simonds ' bubble had a strike through it , and all other votes on the ballot were for republicans . yancey and simonds are now tied at 11,608 votes each , and republicans hold a 50-49 majority in the virginia house . the next representative of the 94th house district will now be chosen " by lot , " as per state law . the chairman of virginia 's board of elections says this will most likely involve picking a name out of a bowl . whoever loses the drawing can still petition for a second recount . " i 'm really grateful that every vote has been counted , " yancey says . but democrats are upset the ballot was n't challenged until after republicans had approved the recount results and congratulated simonds on her victory .
