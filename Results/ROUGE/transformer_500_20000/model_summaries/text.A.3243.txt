struggling to keep warm this winter ? you may want to avoid other people who look cold : a new study published in plos one suggests humans experience " temperature contagion . " subjects saw their own temperatures sink after watching videos of people putting their hands in chilly water , per a press release from the university of sussex . their left hands became colder by an average of 0.4 degrees fahrenheit , while their right hands ' temperatures dropped by an average of 0.1 degrees , real clear science reports . the researchers classified that temperature change as " significant . " such sympathetic coldness could be an adaptive trait , says lead researcher dr. neil harrison . " humans are profoundly social creatures , and much of humans ' success results from our ability to work together in complex communities , " he explains . " this would be hard to do if we were not able to rapidly empathize with each other and predict one another 's thoughts , feelings , and motivations . " when the 36 subjects saw videos of people putting their hands in warm water , however , the subjects ' body temperatures stayed the same—perhaps because the cold was more evident than the heat in the videos , harrison notes . the " cold " clips showed blocks of ice throughout , whereas the " hot " ones only briefly showed steam at their start . " there is also some evidence to suggest that people may be more sensitive to others appearing cold than hot , " he points out . yawning is among other contagious behaviors , as medical daily notes—and even dogs are susceptible .
