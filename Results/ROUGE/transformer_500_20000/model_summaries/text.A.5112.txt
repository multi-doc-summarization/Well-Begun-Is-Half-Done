the feds have interviewed the amtrak engineer at the controls before this week 's crash in philadelphia , and while brandon bostian was fully cooperative , he says he still ca n't remember a thing about the derailment , reports cnn . but the more interesting development came from an interview with an assistant conductor , who said she thought she heard bostian say before the crash that the train 's windshield had been " broken by something , ” reports the philadelphia inquirer . “ we have seen damage to the left-hand lower portion of amtrak windshield that we have asked the fbi to come in and look at for us , ” says ntsb board member robert sumwalt . prior to the crash , two other trains in the area had been hit by some kind of projectile , reports the inquirer . one was a southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority train , and the assistant conductor remembers hearing about it . " she recalled that the septa engineer had reported to the train dispatcher that he had either been hit by a rock or shot at , and the septa engineer said that he had a broken windshield , and he placed his train into emergency stop , " says sumwalt . " she also believed that she heard ( the amtrak ) engineer say something about his train being struck by something . " as for bostian , he told the ntsb that he had n't been sick or tired , but insisted he remembers nothing beyond the point his train left the nearby station in north philly . ( the train was clearly speeding up before entering a curve at twice the speed limit . )
