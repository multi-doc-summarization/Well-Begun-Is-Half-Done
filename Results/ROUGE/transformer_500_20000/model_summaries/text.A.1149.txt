scientists at uc berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading , reconstructing youtube videos based on brain scans from people who ’ d seen them . researchers would put subjects into an mri machine and track their brain activity as they viewed videos . once they ’ d build a model of how a subject ’ s mind processed the video , “ we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backward … to try to uncover what the viewer saw , ” one study coauthor tells abc news . using the scans they were then able to reproduce the videos—though they ’ re blurry . “ this is a major leap , ” the co-author says . he thinks the technique could eventually be used to reconstruct dreams or memories , if it turns out the brain processes those things similarly to how it processes movies . “ it ’ s our next line of research. ” ( more details on how the experiment worked , along with a video , at pc magazine . )
