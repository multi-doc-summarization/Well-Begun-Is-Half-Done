" the gofundme campaign has raised more than $ 30,000 to date . the most heart-tugging line on the page , from carpenter 's description of the events immediately after paige got out of the pool : " she looked into my eyes and screamed , and said , 'mom , i 'm dying . i know i am because i can see it in your eyes . ' " ( a teen 's allergic reaction recently caused her to " burn from the inside out . " )
