federal agents discovered two more major drug tunnels between california and mexico this week , reports usa today . each began under a warehouse in tijuana and ended under another in san diego . the discovery holds a lesson for cartels : if you 're going to spend millions building these things , you might want to invest in better fronts . immigration and customs enforcement agents found the first one after noting that the us warehouse had nothing but cheap toys inside , as if it were an exporter , the same front used in a tunnel found last year , reports the union-tribune . the discovery of the first tunnel led to the discovery of the second one in a nearby warehouse in the same industrial park . authorities arrested a 73-year-old woman in chula vista , california , suspected of supervising the smuggling operations , reports the la times . the tunnels were 600 to 700 yards long and were equipped with lighting and rail systems , with one notably more sophisticated than the other . unlike previous discoveries—these are the sixth and seventh tunnels found between tijuana and san diego since 2010—no drugs were found during the raids .
