a uk hospital made an " appalling " error right before a 68-year-old died there , says his daughter , and now she and her family are suing the hospital for it . william hannah passed away in september 2017 at salford royal hospital while being treated after a car accident that had left him with several broken bones and serious head injuries , the bbc reports . hannah also developed a lung infection , and it was while trying to ease his breathing that hospital staff made the mistake that has spurred the hannah family 's complaint . per a release from their lawyers , a doctor went to flush out one of hannah 's lungs with saline solution , but an assistant accidentally passed him a bottle of cleaning detergent instead , which the doctor then " unknowingly " used to rinse hannah 's lung , people reports . the doctor realized the mistake afterward and tried to get as much of the detergent out of hannah 's lung as he could , but hannah 's lawyers say the grandfather 's condition deteriorated and he died the next day . in a statement to people , the hospital 's medical director acknowledges that hannah " did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on . " the bbc cites an internal hospital report that found what happened to hannah was due to various factors , including poor communication and staff training , a container without a label , an equipment cart that was n't adequately stocked , and " distraction by other life critical tasks . " an inquiry into the exact cause of hannah 's death will take place in early 2019 . ( glenn frey 's widow says mount sinai caused his death . )
