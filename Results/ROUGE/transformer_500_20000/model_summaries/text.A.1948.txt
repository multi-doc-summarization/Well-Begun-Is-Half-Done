the tea party is mad as hell and ... that 's about it , writes richard cohen in the washington post . beyond anger , the tea party " has no leader . it has no address , no phone , and no washington headquarters . it is everywhere and nowhere . " when a post posse tried to track down 2,300 local tea-drinking groups , it could verify only 647 . cohen writes that " the tea party exists in the vapors , " bound only by anger and the internet . the latter eliminates the middleman— " in this case an actual political party , which was once called the organization because it actually organized . " " now that 's done laptop to laptop so like-minded people can get together , even if they do not actually get together . " this creates an " asymmetrical , " impossible-to-nail-down enemy for obama , but it 's an enemy who is seeking change—which is exactly what pushed obama into the presidency . " the tea party is here to stay if only because the internet is here to stay . but its emotions and its grievances can be co-opted , engulfed , absorbed and made part of the engine of change that obama himself once both personified and promised . as i recall , the original tea party was open to anyone . all you needed for admittance was anger .
