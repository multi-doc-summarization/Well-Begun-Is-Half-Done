think carbs are a dieter 's enemy ? it turns out restricting one 's fat intake leads to a 68 % greater loss of body fat than restricting the same amount of calories through carbohydrates in obese adults on strictly controlled diets—and this is in spite of the fact that a low-carb diet reduces insulin and increases fat burning . so says a physicist turned metabolism researcher at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases who wanted to test a mathematical model he devised that projected similar results . reporting in the journal cell metabolism , kevin hall says that while many believe that cutting carbs reduces fat faster , none had actually tested the impact of cutting carbs while keeping fat at a base line or vice versa . so he checked 19 consenting non-diabetic adults with obesity into to a metabolic ward for two 2-week periods , controlling and accounting for every single bite they ate . as his model predicted , people lost more body fat when their dietary fat was restricted than when carbs were , even though a low-carb diet does indeed burn more fat . but his model also predicted that in the long term , these differences would become less pronounced for diets that have the same number of calories , according to the press release . " over the long term , it 's pretty close , " hall says . he used data from dozens of controlled feeding studies from decades of nutrition research to develop the model , but he cautions that the study is both small and highly controlled , meaning people 's unrestricted diets may cause them to eat differently . " the real world is more complicated than a research lab , and if you have obesity and want to lose weight , it may be more important to consider which type of diet you ’ ll be most likely to stick to over time , " he tells the national institutes of health .
