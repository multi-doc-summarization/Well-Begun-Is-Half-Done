the hubble telescope has spotted a spectacular , perplexing object in the middle of the asteroid belt : a rock with six " comet-like " dust tails streaming behind it . " we were literally dumbfounded when we saw it , " david jewitt , the head of the astronomy team studying the p/2013 p5 , said in a nasa release . " even more amazing , its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust . that also caught us by surprise . it 's hard to believe we 're seeing an asteroid . " the team hypothesizes that the sun 's radiation set the 260-yard-wide rock spinning—thanks , discovery explains , to the yarkovsky-o'keefe-radzievskii-paddack effect—so quickly that it lost structural integrity . using modeling , one team member calculated six dates when the asteroid likely ejected dust into space . so far , it has likely ejected as much as 1,000 tons of dust into space , but that 's still a tiny fraction of its mass . " this is just an amazing object to us , and almost certainly the first of many , " jewitt says . " in astronomy , when you find one , you eventually find a whole bunch more . "
