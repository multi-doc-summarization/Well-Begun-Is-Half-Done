forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find malaysia airlines flight mh370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century , the bbc reports . that 's how air france flight 447 was found in 2009 , using " bayesian statistics " to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another . named after presbyterian minister and mathematician thomas bayes , the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map : for example , what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure ? how far do planes tend to crash from their last known location ? what was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations ? it 's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is , what your favorite restaurant-review website says , and so on—except that experts hunting for airbus a330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the atlantic , five thirty-eight notes . it was so hard that the us team of statisticians invited by france gave up , until they de-emphasized one statistic : that a plane 's black box emits a signal after a crash 90 % of the time . they changed their findings , and presto , the plane was found . bayesian techniques have helped people find world war ii u-boats , men overboard , and sunken treasure , but there 's no evidence that malaysia is employing them now . " i suspect that they just guess , like professional baseball managers used to do before moneyball , " says a biostatistician .
