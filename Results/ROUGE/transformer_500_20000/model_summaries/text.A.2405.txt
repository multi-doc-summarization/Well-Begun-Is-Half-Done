most of the national attention in tuesday 's election is focused on gop gains in the senate , but roll call points out that republicans also are poised to hand president obama a milestone he 'd rather avoid in the house . consider that democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 ( or maybe more ) seats on tuesday . no president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since harry truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950 , writes stuart rothenberg . dwight eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66 , but obama seems on track to top him . more typical is the pattern of bill clinton , who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998 . still , if tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the gop , politico offers a reality check , at least in the senate : several first-term republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016 . so even if republicans win a small majority this year , they might have to give it right back two years later .
