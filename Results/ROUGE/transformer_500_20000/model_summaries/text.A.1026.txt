is the grass always greener on the other side of the fence ? if you find yourself plagued by the question , thank the lateral frontal pole behind each of your eyebrows , says oxford researcher matthew rushworth . the lateral frontal pole is a newly identified part of your brain which , scientists believe , helps us recognize when we 've made poor decisions . " there are a few brain areas that monitor how good our choices are , and that is a very sensible thing to have . but this region monitors how good the choices are that we did n't take , " notes rushworth . researchers zeroed in on the lateral front pole by scanning 25 people 's brains using two imaging techniques . putting the scans together helped the scientists learn about connections between the ventrolateral frontal cortex—which deals with language and cognition—and the rest of the brain , the guardian reports . from there , the experts divided the ventrolateral frontal cortex into 12 regions , and then scanned monkeys ' brains looking for those same regions . the scans indicate that monkeys have 11 of them—but only humans have the lateral frontal pole , science 2.0 reports . in other words , the site notes , it 's part of " what makes us human . " ( more brain news : older brains are n't weaker . )
