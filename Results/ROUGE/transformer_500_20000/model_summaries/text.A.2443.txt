last week it was apparent that there 's no love lost between donald trump and new york times columnist gail collins , but this week it 's all-out war . seems the donald responded to collins ' column , which tweaked him as a loopy birther , with a letter to the editor tweaking her in turn as a no-good hack for writing " nasty and derogatory articles about me . " " actually , " trump writes , " i have great respect for ms. collins in that she has survived so long with so little talent . her storytelling ability and word usage ( coming from me , who has written many bestsellers ) , is not at a very high level . " snap ! this week , collins slaps back , noting that the bestselling author himself once sent her an " aggrieved message ... in which he misspelled the word 'too . ' ‚Äù further , she runs down his birther allegations , dismissing his doubts about president obama 's birth certificate , his grandmother , and his authorship of dreams from my father as all but absurd . " recent polls have shown trump running second among potential republican primary voters , " collins concludes . " i believe this is not so much an indication of popularity as a desperate plea to be delivered from mitt romney . "
