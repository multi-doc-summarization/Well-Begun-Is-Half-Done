if , someday , bedbugs are no longer a cause for concern , remember to thank regine gries . she 's a biologist in british columbia who was willing to tolerate 180,000 bites as a host for the creatures so that her team could study them . " i calmed myself down thinking when human beings were still living in caves , they were probably bitten by bedbugs , by fleas , by mice and who knows what , " she tells the canadian press via ctv . " so i think humans can endure this , and i 'm lucky enough that i have no side effects , that i just can handle it . " it seems her work has paid off . the researchers , including gries ' husband , found a histamine molecule that , to the bugs , indicates a " safe space , " the press reports ; once the bugs find it , they stick around . the researchers lured them to the trap using a pheromone blend and components from the bedbugs ' own feces ; the histamine then keeps them there . the cost of the chemicals ? less than a dime per trap . " the biggest challenge in dealing with bedbugs is to detect the infestation at an early stage , " gries ' husband tells simon fraser university news . " this trap will help landlords , tenants , and pest-control professionals determine whether premises have a bedbug problem , so that they can treat it quickly . " the trap should be on the market next year , cbc reports . that 's particularly good news for chicago , which was reported earlier this year to be america 's worst city for bedbugs . ( another researcher suffered bee stings in the name of science . )
