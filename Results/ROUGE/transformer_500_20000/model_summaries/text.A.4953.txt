joe mcquaid , publisher of new hampshire ’ s union leader , was at the red arrow diner in manchester during a recent visit from mitt romney , and he got a bit of much-needed clarification on an issue that ’ s been bothering some people : why in the world is romney giving his foes fodder for complaint by quadrupling the size of his california beach house ? easy answer : the story isn ’ t accurate , romney explained . in truth , his application was to simply double the living space by adding a second story . of course , if you include the additional nonliving space—including a basement and a garage—then you get to the “ quadrupling. ” even so , mcquaid thinks romney should make an official statement to clear the issue up . “ accuracy in media is more than the name of a group . it ought to be what we in the profession strive for , rather than to have the story fit a preconceived notion , ” mcquaid writes . “ we sure can not afford to pick any more of our presidents based on assumptions. ” ( but in a snarky post on wonkette , kirsten boyd johnson notes , " mitt romney still appears as out-of-touch with the vast majority of hobo americans as ever before . " )
