a disturbing video shot friday in texas appears to show the fatal police shooting of a suspect while his arms are raised in surrender . the ksat video , which runs more than four minutes and was shot from a distance , shows two bexar county sheriff deputies , greg vasquez and robert sanchez , approach gilbert flores in a san antonio neighborhood after a call about a domestic dispute . around the one-minute mark , flores raises his arms and the officers appear to fire at least two shots from about 10 yards away . flores appears to slouch forward before falling to the ground . an officer approaches flores ' seemingly lifeless body 30 seconds later , grabs his arm , and drags him along the ground . an ambulance arrives just before the video ends . police say they first tried to subdue flores , 41 , with a taser and shield before shooting him , per the san antonio express-news . it is n't clear how many shots were fired or how many times flores was hit . police say the 20-minute encounter began when officers visited a home in the area to find a bleeding woman with a cut on her head , holding a baby who may have been injured , per ksat . they say flores , who had a criminal record , was there holding a knife . " certainly , what 's in the video is a cause for concern , " a sheriff tells the new york daily news . " but it 's important to let the investigation go through its course . " a district attorney agrees the video is " troubling , " telling ksat , " there 's actually another video with a better view that is very close . " he adds , " there 's a lot of information before , including 911 calls and information from different witnesses inside the house . " on facebook , bexar county police slam ksat for posting the video , calling the move " unethical and sad " and " sensational behavior , " noting it has resulted in " physical threats toward our deputies . " vasquez and sanchez are both on administrative leave .
