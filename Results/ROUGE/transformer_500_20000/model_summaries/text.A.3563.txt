mel gibson has been persona non grata for some time in hollywood , following a string of headline-making infractions , including dui troubles and accusations of anti-semitism and domestic violence . as the guardian puts it , " there was a time when you would have remarked that mel could n't get arrested in hollywood , except for the fact that arrested was pretty much all he could get . " but gibson showed up on the golden globes stage tonight , and that put host ricky gervais—who had poked fun of gibson at the 2010 awards—on the spot . " i like a drink as much as the next man—unless the next man is mel gibson , " gervais said six years ago , and he chastised the globes ' network sunday night for making him face his target , saying , " i blame nbc for this terrible situation " and adding , " mel blames ... well , we know who mel blames , " variety reports . still , he noted , " i 'd rather have a drink with him in his hotel room tonight than with bill cosby . " gibson , for his part , played the straight man and just introduced clips from mad max : fury road—though he did say , " i love seeing ricky every three years because it reminds me to get a colonoscopy .
