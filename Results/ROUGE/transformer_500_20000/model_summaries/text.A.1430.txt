if you 're worried about the people in the path of hurricane irma , perhaps you should also worry about the segment of them that thinks shooting at the storm will make it go away . as the ap reports , the following is an actual tweet from the pasco county sheriff 's office : " do not shoot weapons @ ( hashtag ) irma . you wo n't make it turn around ( and ) it will have very dangerous side effects . " the sheriff 's office , which is in the tampa bay area , was responding to a facebook event page created by two florida men inviting people to shoot at irma . the page reads : " yo so this goofy ... lets show irma that we shoot first ... " the invitation presumably was a joke , but 80,000 people indicated they were " going " or " interested " in the event . in another tweet , the sheriff 's office also had another suggestion for the thousands who shared the page . irma hit key west early sunday .
