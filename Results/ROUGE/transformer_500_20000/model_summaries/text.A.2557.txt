here 's a story about a former child star who grew up to be a talk show host with apparently poor impulse control : susan olsen , better known as cindy brady of the eponymous brady bunch , is out of a job after a feud with actor leon acord-whiting , who is gay . how it went down , via us magazine and fox news : acord-whiting appeared on an la talk radio politics show co-hosted by olsen , then took to facebook to complain that " susan olsen spreads outrageous misinformation & it is dangerous and unprofessional . " apparently one does not cross cindy brady , because olsen posted this to her own facebook page : " this is the little piece of human waste . he blocked himself from me before i could even get one hit in . if you can find him , please send him my love . " from there , it was war : acord-whiting then posted a screenshot of a less-than-brady-like personal message allegedly from olsen , reading thusly : " hey there little p -- sy , let me get my big boy pants on and reallly take you on ! ! ! what a snake in the grass you are you lying piece of s -- t too cowardly to confront me in real life so you do it on facebook . you are the biggest f -- -- t ass in the world the biggest p -- sy ! my d -- k is bigger than yours which ai n't sayin much ! what a true piece of s -- t you are ! lying f -- -- t ! i hope you meet your karma slowly and painfully . " and per la talk radio , as of friday : " we will not tolerate hateful speech by anyone associated with our radio station and have severed our ties with a host that veered off the direction in which we are going . "
