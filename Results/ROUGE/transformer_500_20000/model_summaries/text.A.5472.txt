a ship 's chaplain in the 1740s wrote of sailors ' gums that would grow out of control until they protruded from the mouth and rotted away , leaving a horrific case of bad breath , the bbc reports . so it turns out that not only was scurvy once incredibly dangerous , it was also super gross . real clear science reports that approximately 2 million sailors died from scurvy , which is caused by a lack of vitamin c , between 1500 and 1800 . during his voyage across the pacific , magellan lost 80 % of his crew to the disease called " the plague of the sea , " according to the bbc . one historian says scurvy killed more sailors than battle , storms , shipwrecks , and other diseases combined . and , it was n't a pleasant way to go , either . scurvy starts with lethargy before causing achy joints , swollen limbs , and loose teeth , according to real clear science . from there , sufferers get swollen gums , bad breath , and bruising . the skin turns yellow , then black , just before sufferers die from internal hemorrhaging . the tragic part is scurvy is ridiculously easy to cure . real clear science reports someone on the brink of death from the disease could be saved by eating one-fifth of an orange every day for a week . alas , doctors of the time did n't know what vitamins were , and ships were n't exactly built to store fresh fruit . the disease is mostly gone now , but a post at phys.org notes that nasa scientists are using the lessons learned to ensure astronauts get the vitamins they need to stay healthy in space . ( is it possible kids are getting too many vitamins ? )
