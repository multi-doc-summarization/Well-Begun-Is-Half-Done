for the first time in 45 years , americans who support the death penalty ca n't count themselves among the majority . just 49 % of americans polled from late august to early september said they supported capital punishment for people guilty of murder , while 42 % said they opposed it , according to the pew research center . recent botched executions by lethal injection may be responsible for the drop in support from march 2015 , when 56 % of americans backed the death penalty , reports business insider . but support has actually fallen across the political spectrum since the mid-1990s , when support reached 80 % as violent crime and murder rates rose , per the washington post . some 57 % of white americans now support the death penalty , compared to 29 % of blacks and 36 % of hispanics , according to the poll of 1,201 adults . men , older americans , and those without a college degree are also more likely to support the death penalty . but just 34 % of democrats support capital punishment , compared to 71 % two decades ago , reports the new york times . some 72 % of republicans support it , down from 87 % , and 44 % of independents support it , down from 57 % . as support has fallen , so have the number of executions . there have been just 15 so far this year , including 12 in texas and georgia . ( ohio is set to resume executions after a three-year break . )
