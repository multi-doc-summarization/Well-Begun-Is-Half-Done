it started with a candy wrapper and ended ( for now ) in a courtroom . nestle 's attempts to trademark the shape of its " four-fingered " kitkat have been rejected by the european court of justice , which ruled that shape alone is n't enough to recognize it as a kitkat , the bbc reports . the decision was a setback for nestle—which manages the brand overseas ; hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the us—and a victory for cadbury , which was trying to block the trademark . the ruling means that , for now , other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars . nestle , which reaped more than $ 60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the uk from kitkat , argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the kitkat brand over the past eight decades , bloomberg notes . but cadbury said the shape was n't enough to make a consumer automatically think " kitkat , " and the court agreed . the bbc even notes that in norway , a lesser-known chocolate bar called kvikk lunsj ( " quick lunch " ) has been around for nearly as long as kitkat . the fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they 've had in recent years : in 2013 , nestle managed to block cadbury 's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers , per bloomberg . kitkat case now heads back to the uk high court , which will render a final decision . ( claims of excess lead in nestle noodles led to a major recall in india . )
