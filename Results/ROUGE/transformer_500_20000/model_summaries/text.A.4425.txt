if you 've ever found yourself struggling through a so-called " classic " book only to find yourself thinking , " how racist/sexist/boring , " you 're not alone . the editors of gq , along with some current authors , have put together a list of 21 such books ( technically 20 , because one of them got two votes ) that are simply outdated and should be struck from the " great books " canon . the list got itself mentioned on fox & friends last weekend , and not in a good way—it includes the bible , which jesse ball calls " repetitive , self-contradictory , sententious , foolish , and even at times ill-intentioned , " leading fox news religion contributor father jonathan morris to push back by calling its inclusion on the list " foolish , " usa today reports . lots of social media users also decried the choice , and evangelist franklin graham said the editors " could n't be more wrong . " as for what else made the list , here 's a sampling—along with the books the editors and the authors they spoke to think you should read instead : the adventures of huckleberry finn by mark twain : this is the book that got two votes . " mark twain was a racist . ... he was a man of his time , so let 's leave him there , " writes tommy orange . instead , he suggests reading the adventures and misadventures of maqroll by alvaro mutis ; caity weaver suggests narrative of the life of frederick douglass , an american slave .
