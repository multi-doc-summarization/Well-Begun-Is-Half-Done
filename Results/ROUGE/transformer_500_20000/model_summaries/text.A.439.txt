two afghan airmen who did n't show up for training at a us air force base in georgia on monday are missing , and authorities suspect it 's because they do n't want to go home . an air force spokesman tells usa today that law enforcement officials are searching for mirwais kohistani and shirzad rohullah , who were being trained in aircraft maintenance . the spokesman tells 11alive that the men were nominated by the afghan air force and heavily vetted by us authorities before being accepted for training at moody air force base , so they probably do n't pose a threat to anybody in the us . " it 's not the first time it 's happened , so we just want to find them if we can , " he says . another air force spokesman tells the ap that the trainees , who were allowed off the base over the weekend and have n't been heard from since , were due to graduate from the training program next week and return to afghanistan . the police chief in the nearby town of valdosta tells the ap that there is " zero indication " that the men are terrorists . " you 've got to remember these folks were cleared by the us military and by the department of defense to come in and train , " he says . " these guys have been here since february of 2015 , and they have not caused a problem at all . " three afghan soldiers who vanished during a training exercise in massachusetts last year were sent back to their homeland after being caught at the canadian border .
