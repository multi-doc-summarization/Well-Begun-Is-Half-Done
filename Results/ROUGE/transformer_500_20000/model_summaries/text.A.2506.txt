emerging from a mountainside 4,600 feet above sea level , two giant hands appear to hold a thin gold thread . only it 's not a thread at all , but a nearly 500-foot-long bridge . cau vang or the golden bridge , which recently opened in vietnam 's ba na hills after about a year of construction , is the latest architectural feat to make waves around the world . as reuters reports , it 's " as if the mountain itself has sprouted limbs " of weathered stone , dotted with what appears to be green moss . they were designed to mimic the " hands of gods , pulling a strip of gold out of the land , " says vu viet anh of ta landscape architecture in ho chi minh city , which designed the new pedestrian bridge in thien thai garden . per the bbc , a second , connecting bridge of silver , to resemble a god 's strand of hair , is also in the works . the stone-colored hands made of steel mesh and fiberglass appear to hold the golden pedestrian bridge , whose supports are painted green to blend in with the treetops . " it creates a walkway in the sky , among the foggy and fairy-like lands of ba na mountain , " says anh , who was nonetheless surprised by the international response . per reuters and my modern met , the bridge lined with purple flowers has already hosted " scores of tourists " and a bridal fashion show since opening in june . many more visitors are expected , as the ba na hills area drew more than 2.7 million visitors last year . the attraction , which offers majestic views of da nang , is apparently worth the trip . " it makes me feel like humans can do anything , " one tourist tells reuters . the guardian has photos of other unusual pedestrian walkways . ( another modern marvel : the largest cruise ship to ever set sail . )
