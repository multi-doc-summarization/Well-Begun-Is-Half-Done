a 68-year-old british man was walking his dog in a birmingham park last week when the german shepherd suddenly ran over to the bushes and refused to return . owner roger wilday walked over to find her lying down next to what looked like trash ... but as he got closer , he realized it was actually a newborn infant . " i saw it move , " wilday tells the birmingham mail . " i thought it was a bag of kittens , but then i saw her little arms and a head , and the baby started to cry . " the six-pound baby girl was brought to the hospital and named jade , after the dog . she 's " alert , happy , and contented " while recovering , and police are looking for her mother . canine jade " must have heard the baby crying as these dogs have very good hearing , plus she â€™ s very keen on our grandchildren , " wilday says . " whenever she hears their names she whimpers . she just loves kids . " he and his wife are hoping they 'll be allowed to see the little girl , who , police say , could have died had she been left outside even a few more hours . she was just a few days old when found , the mirror notes .
