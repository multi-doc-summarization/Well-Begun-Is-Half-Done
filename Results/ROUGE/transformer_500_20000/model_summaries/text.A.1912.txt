last time george talley saw his beloved 1979 corvette , it was parked on jefferson avenue in detroit in the summer of 1981 , reports wxyz . he 'd long ago given up hope of ever getting the stolen car back , but then came a call out of the blue from authorities in mississippi who found it via a false vin number . better yet , it seems to be in decent shape , with only 47,000 miles . talley , now 71 and still the rightful owner , told the tale on a detroit radio station today , his only lament being that he had to figure out how to get the car shipped to michigan . enter gm exec mark reuss , who happened to catch the show , reports the detroit free press . the company is going to pick up the car for its former employee and ship it back free of charge . ( a 1957 chevy stolen 30 years also recently made its way home . )
