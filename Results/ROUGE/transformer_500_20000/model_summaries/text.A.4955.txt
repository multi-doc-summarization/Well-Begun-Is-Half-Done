separatists in eastern ukraine are starting to complain that moscow has sold them out , as they prepare for what the new york times is declaring their " last stand . " as they retreated toward donetsk yesterday , insurgents blew up two road bridges and a railroad bridge behind them . an emboldened ukraine today said that it would not reopen ceasefire negotiations until the rebels had laid down their weapons entirely , the ap reports . the once undermanned and outgunned ukrainian force is now noticeably better armed , using buses and pickup trucks alongside its armored vehicles to transport what the telegraph describes as a " motley mix " of police , special forces , and militiamen . ukraine says it has succeeded in sealing the russian border , preventing troops and weapons from flowing to the rebels . but vladimir putin has been suspiciously silent , ignoring the separatists ' increasingly urgent pleas for help , and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses , having already taken the real prize of crimea , the wall street journal reports . observers believe moscow has ruled out any military intervention , and foreign minister sergei lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference , saying , " a quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest . " but one us official cautioned against declaring victory . " there is only one person who knows what putin is planning , " he said , " and that is putin . "
