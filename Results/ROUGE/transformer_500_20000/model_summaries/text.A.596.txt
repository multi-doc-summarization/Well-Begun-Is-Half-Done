what 's said to have been the biggest child-pornography production case in minnesota history ended tuesday in a st. paul courtroom , and two of the victims faced down their tormenter there . " we all can now be given freedom from this , " one of the unnamed victims , now a young man , said after anton martynenko , 32 , was sentenced to 38 years in prison for what the minneapolis star tribune calls a " massive sextortion scheme . " how that scheme worked : martynenko would set up fake online profiles ( often as teen girls ) to lure teen boys into sending him nude pics , which he 'd then post online . all told , he tricked more than 155 boys , mainly between 14 and 16 , in multiple states , kmsp reports . martynenko , who pleaded guilty in january , " delighted in the humiliation , embarrassment , and potential negative consequences his actions caused his victims , " prosecutors said , per court docs . once martynenko had the boys ' photos , he 'd threaten to post the pics online , and he 'd often follow through . he also managed to persuade three boys into committing sexual acts on him , and two of his victims ended up killing themselves . one of the victims who appeared in court , now 21 , said " my life has become a living hell " from the experience , while the other , who 's around 19 , noted martynenko was " a terrible human being who spent years of his life making hundreds of teen boys miserable . " side note : martynenko had two years lopped off his sentence for helping investigators on the jacob wetterling case . he 'd shared a jail cell with danny heinrich , jacob 's killer , at one point and had apparently procured information . ( the break in the wetterling case came in september after 27 years . )
