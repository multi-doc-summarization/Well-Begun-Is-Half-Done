not a bad result for roseanne barr : only five people finished ahead of her in this year 's presidential election , notes the independent political report . the comedian ran on the pro-pot peace and freedom ticket and drew more than 49,500 votes , according to pbs election results . that puts her in sixth , behind obama ( 61 million ) , romney ( 58 million ) , gary johnson ( 1.2 million ) , jill stein ( 410,000 ) , and virgil goode ( 115,000 ) . note : an earlier version of this file based on google 's election results said she placed fifth , but those results left out goode . ) myfox tampa bay notes that barr drew about 8,000 votes in florida , which , by the way , remains too close to call for either obama or romney . ( do n't hold your breath for a result tonightâ€”the miami herald says votes in miami-dade wo n't be fully counted until tomorrow . ) no hard feelings from roseanne , though . she tweeted congratulations to president obama , notes the huffington post .
