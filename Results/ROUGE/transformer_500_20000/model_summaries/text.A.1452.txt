snow white and the huntsman , the latest take on the fairy tale starring kristen stewart and charlize theron , is an impressive spectacle , featuring all kinds of brooding visual effects . but critics are sharply divided as to whether the film is an overall success : " there is nothing cute about this movie . and that feels right . there is something exciting about how seriously snow white and the huntsman takes its themes , " writes ao scott in the new york times . the movie is " an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages , " writes betsy sharkey in the los angeles times . " but what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate loveâ€”its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white . " but at slate , dana stevens calls the film " increasingly incoherent " and feels like it " squanders the dramatic potential inherent in the ancient fairy tale " by keeping snow white and the queen separate for all but two scenes . " as snow , stewart gets to swing a sword , but do n't be fooled , " notes rafer guzman in newsday . " she spends so much time waffling sullenly between two warrior-suitors that snow white feels like little more than twilight in chain mail . "
