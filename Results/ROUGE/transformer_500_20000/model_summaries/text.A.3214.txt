papa needs a new pair of â€¦ cows ? zynga yesterday filed the first salvo of paperwork necessary to obtain an online gambling license in nevada , the wall street journal reports . but do n't expect to be betting on farmville ( or more likely titles like zynga poker ) anytime soon . the document filed yesterday was a request for the state to decide if zynga is even potentially suitable for a license , and that decision alone is expected to take 12 to 18 months . it 's unclear how long after that final approval would come . the move comes amidst a rapidly changing legal landscape around online gambling . nevada became the first state to legalize online poker earlier this year . though it has handed out a few licenses already , none of the companies ' online poker games is up and running yet . and when they are , they 'll be limited to state residents . but that could soon change : harry reid and jon kyl are working on a bill that would legalize online poker nationwide and even create an office of online poker oversight , the journal reported yesterday . however , the bill would simultaneously ban most other forms of online gambling .
