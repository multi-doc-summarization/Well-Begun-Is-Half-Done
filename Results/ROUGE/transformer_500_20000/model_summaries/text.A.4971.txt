far-right candidate marine le pen and independent emmanuel macron have been drawing the lion 's share of attention as the french presidential election nears ( the first round is april 23 ) , but a leftist candidate who has used a hologram of himself to stump at campaign rallies is now gaining some traction . in what the washington post calls a " truly unprecedented campaign , " jean-luc melenchon has seemingly emerged out of thin air as the unbowed france candidate , with added support from the french communist partyâ€”and he " gives shivers to banks , businesspeople , and the bourgeoisie , " per the new york times . melenchon , once considered a fringe candidate no one really paid mind to , is running on an anti-capitalism platform , with a mission to dismantle the monarchy-styled governmental system implemented by charles de gaulle in the late '50s . melenchon is now ahead of mainstream conservative francois fillon in the polls and only a couple of points behind macron and le pen . he 's been speaking to the younger set with videos on youtube and a video game in which players go after bankers and the head of the imf . what makes this year 's election in france notable is that the slightly left-leaning socialists and slightly right-leaning republicans are n't the ones duking it out for the country 's top seat . and the showdown between le pen and melenchon , whom the times says is sometimes depicted as a " french bernie sanders , " even sounds strikingly like the one witnessed between sanders and donald trump , with both candidates vying for voters who want to decimate the status quo , though with different tactics : le pen is tapping into nationalism , while melenchon is pushing help for the poor . ( facebook is going after false accounts before the election . )
