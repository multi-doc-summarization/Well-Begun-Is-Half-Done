when joan and richard bowell decided it was time to leave the greek island of syros , they first needed to find someone to manage the cat sanctuary they 'd established there . god 's little people cat rescue , which started with one stray mama cat and her two kittens , expanded to more than 60 cats roaming the bowells ' property as they continued to take in strays . they posted a facebook ad for a modestly paid job managing the sanctuary—and 40,000 people responded . the ad went viral , spawning headlines about the " dream job " or " purrrfect job , " leading the bowells to explain to would-be caretakers that it would , in fact , often be a difficult job—not only would poop have to be scooped and the like , but " heartbreaking decisions " would need to be made about sick cats . months later , as the washington post reports , the sanctuary 's caretaker has been chosen . jeffyne telson 's husband sent her the ad soon after it was posted in august , the 62-year-old recalls . telson runs her own cat rescue in santa barbara , calif. , only taking in strays ; she 's adopted out 3,000 cats and kittens over the past 21 years and has kept those who ca n't be placed at her own small sanctuary . her application stood out , and the bowells traveled to california to visit the couple in september . joan and jeffyne clicked immediately , and the bowells offered telson the job . she 'll run the syros sanctuary for some months , while volunteers run her santa barbara rescue , and other finalists for the syros job will likely then take their own turns managing god 's little people . meanwhile , the bowells are looking into expanding the sanctuary , possibly even using it as an international training center for similarly-minded volunteers .
