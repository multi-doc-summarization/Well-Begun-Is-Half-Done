" debney is a strong supporter of the nra , though he has said he never fired a gun before becoming ceo of a gun-maker . debney blamed " challenging market conditions " for falling sales and a collapse in profits , bloomberg reports . he added , however , that after the parkland shooting , there had been " increased foot traffic " to gun stores , leading to " some increased sales , " reuters reports .
