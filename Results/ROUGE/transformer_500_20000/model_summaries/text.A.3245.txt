ecuador officially granted asylum to julian assange today , reasoning that his human rights might be violated if he were turned over to uk authorities . " we can state that there is a risk that he will be persecuted politically , " foreign minister ricardo patino said , according to the guardian . he argued that if assange were ever to fall into us hands he would not receive a fair trial and could face the death penalty , reports the ap . patino also harshly rebuked the uk for threatening to raid ecuador 's embassy , which is traditionally considered sovereign territory . ecuador " is not a british colony , " he said , though he did express hope that ecuador 's " friendship with the united kingdom will remain intact . " the uk has insisted that ecuador 's decision is irrelevant ; it will still attempt to arrest assange . " it is too early to say when or if britain will revoke the ecuadorean embassy 's diplomatic status , " a foreign office spokesman told reuters .
