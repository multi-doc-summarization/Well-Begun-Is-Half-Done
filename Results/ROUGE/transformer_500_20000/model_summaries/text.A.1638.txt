in the 1980s , the university of houston 's cougars basketball team—aka the phi slama jamas—made their way into three final fours . the player described by the houston chronicle as " one of the more flamboyant members " has now been found in the detroit area by a filmmaker , three decades after he disappeared from the public eye . sports illustrated reports on benny " the outlaw " anders , the subject of an espn " 30 for 30 " documentary directed by chip rives to come out later this fall , and it 's such a shocking development that the si headline reads : " benny anders is alive ! " anders was one of college basketball 's " enduring mysteries " after he was benched in 1985 , quit the team , came back a few weeks later , and then fell off the map after whipping out a gun during a fight with a classmate ; he was sentenced to three years ' probation for that incident , per a 2013 si article . and as the current si article notes , he did n't go back to his hometown of bernice , la. , or keep in touch with teammates or relatives . instead , he became what si says was " a jheri-curled version of a phantom . " " it 's like he turned the lights out on his existence , " an ex-houston player says in the documentary . but rives , with the help of former teammate and ex-chicago cop eric davis , followed a bunch of leads until they tracked him down in a rental apartment outside of detroit . the si reveal does n't tell much about anders ' current state of affairs , other than noting he works in a local restaurant and " looks good … weighing far less than 350 pounds , as was rumored . " fans will have to wait for the espn movie to find out more . ( no good news for this former college basketball coach . )
