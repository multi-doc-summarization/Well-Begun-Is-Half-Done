jack mcatee crashed his car into a reservoir in the mountains of colorado on sept. 18 , 2014 . he survived with only a scratch and told a police officer he 'd fallen asleep at the wheel . the officer suspected the crash might 've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in frisco . a day later , the breckenridge man was released and disappeared , reports the washington post . his family told the summit daily news mcatee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder , just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight , but he always resurfaced . over the next year , they scoured the country in search of him , thinking perhaps he 'd gone off the grid like chris mccandless , the subject of his favorite book , into the wild . they reached out to contacts in alaska , where mcatee had flown planes , and homeless shelters , where they thought he might volunteer , but found no sign of him . in july , mcatee 's father wrote online that " there is a 50 % chance that jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive . " but a month later , two hikers found a skull near the top of the peak one , immediately south of frisco ; dna confirmation that the skull was mcatee 's came earlier this month . " our search has come to fruition , " mcatee 's family wrote . " our closure is at hand , albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process . " it 's still not clear how or when mcatee died . his skull was all that was found of his remains , reports the denver post . what is certain : " a person , an irreplaceable person , is gone , " his family says . but " the story 's not over , " mcatee 's father adds . the family is hoping to raise $ 50,000 to build wells in kenya in mcatee 's memory . nearly $ 15,000 has been raised so far . ( the into the wild author has revised his mccandless death theory . )
