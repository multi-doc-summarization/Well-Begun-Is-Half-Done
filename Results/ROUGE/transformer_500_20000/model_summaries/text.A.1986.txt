jeb bush has not yet announced his presidential candidacy , but some critics contend that his campaign is already struggling—and in a front-page piece , the washington post delves into why that might be . one of the first blunders may have been allowing his political consultant , mike murphy , to hold senior staff meetings in a hotel inside the dallas/fort worth airport—odd for an almost-campaign that 's technically based in florida . the awkwardness that created is just one example of the splintered nature of the upcoming campaign : there have been conflicts , for instance , between longstanding staffers and newer ones , and disagreements over dividing funding between bush ’ s super pac and the campaign itself . “ these things are always tug of wars , ” bush ally thomas d. rath says . “ it ’ s almost like the first day of school , everyone trying to get to the right place and find the right seats. ” the first day of school may have been more like musical chairs , as republican party strategist danny diaz was named campaign manager earlier this week over the more expected choice—david kochel . the selection of diaz just a week before bush declares his candidacy monday is evidence that his team is still working out serious kinks , write ed o'keefe and robert costa ; their piece traces bush 's other apparent problems , including shortfalls in both fundraising and the polls , and of course , that iraq blunder . " in interviews this week , dozens of bush backers and informed republicans ... described an overly optimistic , even haughty exploratory operation , " they write . " strategic errors were exacerbated by unexpected stumbles by the would-be candidate and internal strife within his team . " as for bush , he appears unconcerned . “ it ’ s june , for crying out loud , so we ’ ve got a long way to go , ” bush said of the staffing swap at a news conference yesterday , per the new york times . “ i just urge everybody to be a little more patient about this . ”
