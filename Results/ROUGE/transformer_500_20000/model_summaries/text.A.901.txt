we all know you should n't drink and drive . kenneth bachman is living proof you probably should n't drink and uber either . he was hit with a $ 1,635.93 uber fare after accidentally taking the ride service from near the west virginia university campus , where he was partying with friends last friday night , to his home in new jersey , cbs philadelphia reports . “ we went to a frat party and then went to the bar . i was getting drinks all night ; i probably spent like $ 200 at the bar after already drinking all day , ” bachman says . “ basically , i kinda just blacked out . " needless to say , bachman does n't really remember calling himself an uber . he says he woke up to the driver telling him they were about an hour away from new jersey . “ i was just like , that ’ s crazy . why did you agree to take me to new jersey from west virginia ? ” bachman says . five hours and 300 miles after ordering the uber , bachman was home , the washington post reports . the ride would have been a good deal cheaper if bachman had n't drunkenly treated himself to a more expensive uberxl . according to nj.com , surge pricing also doubled the cost . bachman challenged the fare , arguing he would have told the driver to take him to his friends ' place near the university campus—not all the way to new jersey . " i know i would n't send it to my house , " bachman says . " i knew where i was . " uber states bachman did indeed give the driver his home address , and bachman agreed to pay the fare after the company contacted him . he gave the driver five stars and cash for paying tolls on the way back to west virginia .
