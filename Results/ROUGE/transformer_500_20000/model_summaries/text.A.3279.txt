if you 're hoping to win that $ 500 million powerball jackpot tonight , we have bad and less-than-surprising news for you : it ai n't gon na happen . but one person ultimately has to defy the stacked-way-against-you odds , and if that happens to be you , do this : get yourself some good lawyers and financial advisers , one analyst tells cbs news . actually listen to them . sign that winning ticket and put it somewhere safe . take note : " the safe place is not a shoebox in your closet . " keep quiet , and hold your horses . there 's no reason to claim your prize immediately , and it 's best to get your " team " set up before you come forward . because once you do , you can expect to be inundated with appeals from cash-seeking strangers . remember the winning ticket may not be the answer to your prayers . time lists jackpot winners who would have been better off burning their ticket . here 's one : william post iii won $ 16.2 million . three months after his first payout he was $ 500,000 in debt ( buying an airplane and a restaurant may have been a mistake ) ; his brother allegedly hired a hit man to kill him ; and post himself faced jail time after shooting at a bill collector . but that fate wo n't be yours ... because as cnn sagely points out , you 're not freaking winning this thing : you 're vastly more likely to get struck by lightning , be attacked by a shark , or die from a bee sting . on the odd chance that you do win ( that chance being one in 175,223,510 ) , here are some quirky ways to contextualize your winnings , compliments of hln : if you counted one dollar per second , it would take you 16 years to finish . or you could give a buck to every single person in north america and still walk away with a cool $ 40 million .
