today was a lousy one to be a tourist in europe . taxi cab drivers in paris , london , madrid , berlin , milan , and elsewhere clogged the streets in front of major attractions to protest what they see as unfair competition from the us ride-sharing service uber , reports bloomberg . uber users can summon a taxi with their smartphones , and cabbies think drivers who participate should be subject to the same regulations they areâ€”including pricey licenses . " this about an all-out assault on our profession , our livelihoods , " a driver of one of london 's " black taxis " tells reuters . " these big companies are coming in , not playing by the rules . " uber has run into similar friction in various us cities , though nothing on the scale of today 's coordinated protest in europe . executives for uber , which last week announced $ 1.2 billion in new funding and a valuation of $ 18.2 billion , did n't seem fazed . " if anything , it 's going to make uber even more visible , and make a lot of people realize that they now have choices that they did n't have before , " one tells the wall street journal . ( of course , not all publicity is good publicity . )
