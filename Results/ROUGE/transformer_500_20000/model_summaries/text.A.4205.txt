a young mother in texas who holds down two jobs but does n't have health insurance is in the fight of her lifeâ€”doing battle with not just the necrotizing fasciitis that has already claimed the vision in her left eye but also with her $ 100,000 medical bill . it all started a few hours after a mud run in dallas earlier this month . " my eye started hurting , like maybe i 've got mud or some debris in there , " brittany williams tells cbs dfw . " when i opened my eye , it was just like white . the whole room was white ... . [ the bacteria ] just completely melted off of my eye . " she suspects that debris cut her eye , providing an entryway for the bacteria ; cbs reports it has destroyed her cornea . and while some doctors have told her it 's possible she 'll someday regain vision in that eye with surgery , she needs antibiotics to prevent the bacteria from spreading to other parts of her body and several doctors are denying her treatment because she has no insurance . ( her gofundme page is currently at around $ 11,500 . an updated posted there on tuesday notes " we were asked to leave [ an appointment ] and told we could no longer be treated within their facility secondary to lack of insurance and full payment . " ) williams ' ordeal is n't exactly rare , reports the new york daily news . just last week , dozens of mud runners in france became violently ill from gastroenteritis , likely due to bacteria in the mud , while 22 people contracted a diarrheal illness in nevada in 2012 thanks to bacteria in animal feces on an obstacle course . ( in florida , a " flesh-eating " water bacteria has killed two . )
