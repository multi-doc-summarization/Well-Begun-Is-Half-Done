" there 's a big opening in the middle of the electorate , and bloomberg is on point in that space , " a former john mccain adviser who 's not working with bloomberg tells the wall street journal . a sanders-trump race " would open a path for an independent candidate .

" he added he 'd probably announce by early march . aides say the results of super tuesday on march 1 will help him make his decision . but even if bloomberg does run , one professor says he 'll have a tough go . " it still is difficult to come in from out of the blue and get the traction you need , even when things are really seemingly divisive and there 's a great deal of disenchantment , even when you 're a billionaire , " he says . the republican national committee believes bloomberg would steal votes from the democratic candidate , notes cnn . the dnc 's chair says bloomberg 's priorities are " well cared-for .
