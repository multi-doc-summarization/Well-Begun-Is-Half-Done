north korea has joined a host of other countries in condemning president trump 's speech at the un . trump 's tuesday speech , in which he vowed to " totally destroy " north korea if the country threatened the us or its allies , amounted to " the sound of a barking dog , " ri yong-ho said from new york on wednesday , per the bbc . " there is a saying that goes : 'even when dogs bark , the parade goes on , ' " said ri , who is due to make a speech at the un general assembly on friday . " if he was thinking he could scare us with the sound of a dog barking , that 's really a dog dream , " meaning ludicrous , he added . asked what he thought of trump referring to kim jong un as " rocket man , " ri simply said , " i feel sorry for his aides . " the un general assembly presents a rare opportunity for secretary of state rex tillerson to meet face-to-face with ri , but tillerson suggested the us could n't have a " matter-of-fact discussion with north korea because we do n't know how their means of communication and behavior will be , " reports cnn . trump is due to meet with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and south korean president moon jae-in on thursday after speaking with chinese president xi jinping by phone on monday . though the us wants china to pressure north korea , which gets 90 % of its imports from beijing , chinese foreign minister wang yi repeated thursday that removing the thaad anti-missile system in south korea was key to reducing tensions , per reuters .
