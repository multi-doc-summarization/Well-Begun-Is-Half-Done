usa gymnastics has refused to give up its status at the sport 's national governing body , so the us olympic committee has started what could be a months-long process to force it out . the usoc first moved to decertify usa gymnastics earlier this month , saying the organization had failed to make the right changes after the larry nassar sexual abuse scandal . the usoc says usa gymnastics declined the option to voluntarily relinquish its status and instead asked questions about the hearing process , the new york times reports . " this is a situation in which there are no perfect solutions , " usoc chief executive sarah hirshland said in a statement . " seeking to revoke recognition is not a decision that the usoc came to easily , but we continue to believe it is the right action . " " the path is not crystal clear , but our motives are ... to ensure the ngb for gymnastics in the united states is the type of organization each gymnast and the coaches , trainers and club owners who support them , deserve , " hirshland said . her next step will be to select a three-person panel with representatives from usoc 's board of directors , the national governing bodies council and the athletes ' advisory council to review the complaint and make a recommendation to the full usoc board , usa today reports . usa gymnastics , which is still seeking a new ceo , will remain the sport 's governing body during the process . ( a former usa gymnastics president has been charged with evidence-tampering in the nassar case . )
