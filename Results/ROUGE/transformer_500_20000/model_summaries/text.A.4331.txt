the question of who owns a particular chunk of a famed meteorite is heading to federal court with the filing of a lawsuit and countersuit , sf gate reports . it all started billions of years ago with the fukang meteorite slammed into china 's gobi desert . fast-forward to the year 2000 : when the meteorite was discovered and collectors began acquiring slices of it . among them was stephan settgast , currently of california , who says he bought his 220-pound piece in 2004 . in 2014 , according to court documents , settgast agreed to sell it to lawrence stifler and mary mcfadden of massachusetts for $ 425,000 . and then it all went bad . settgast says the couple violated the conditions of the sale by planning to show it in their rock museum . they say not showing the meteorite was never a condition of the sale and suggest that settgast got " seller 's remorse " after learning he might have undervalued it . and , they allege , that remorse manifested in what they call the " outrageous act " of settgast stealing back the rock from the studio of a pair of kansas rock polishers who spent two years preparing the stone for the buyers , per nbc news . after all , the rock polishers did tell settgast the meteorite could fetch up to $ 1 million ( which , documents point out , would bump up their 5 % fee to $ 50,000 ) . how the alleged theft of the gold-flecked meteorite actually went down is unclear . settgast filed a suit in february alleging breach of contract . stifler , mcfadden , and darryl pitt , the meteorite expert who brokered the deal , countersued last month . local authorities in kansas say they are going to hang back on pursuing settgast for theft until a federal judge determines who owns the meteorite . " this is n't a typical theft , " miami county undersheriff tells nbc . ( no one noticed this meteor the size of a large living room plowing into the earth . )
