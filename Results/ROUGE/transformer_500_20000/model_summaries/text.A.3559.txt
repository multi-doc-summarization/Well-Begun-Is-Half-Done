the 200-year-old buddhist monk found still seated in the lotus position is not dead , but is rather in a rare spiritual state known as tukdam , buddhism experts suggest . dr. barry kerzin , a famous fellow monk who is also a physician to the dalai lama , tells the siberian times that monks in this state go into " very deep meditation " and , if they can stay in such a state for more than three weeks , their bodies shrink until all that remains are " hair , nails , and clothes , " he says . " usually in this case , people who live next to the monk see a rainbow that glows in the sky for several days . this means that he has found a 'rainbow body . ' this is the highest state close to the state of buddha , " and someone who remains in the state can even become a buddha , he says . he adds that over the past five decades , there have been 40 such cases in india . ganhugiyn purevbata , founder and professor at the mongolian institute of buddhist art at ulaanbaatar buddhist university , agrees : the monk " is sitting in the lotus position vajra , the left hand is opened , and the right hand symbolizes of the preaching sutra , " he says . " this is a sign that the lama is not dead , but is in a very deep meditation according to the ancient tradition of buddhist lamas . " but scientists have a different take , theorizing that the cold weather in mongolia , where the monk was found , helped preserve him , the bbc reports . and the washington post notes that such " accidental mummies " have been discovered in freezing climates before , like a 9,000-year-old mummified bison in siberia . meanwhile , there is drama of a less spiritual type unfolding : police say a man stole the monk from a cave in another part of the country and was planning to sell him on the black market , but police learned of the plot , recovered the monk , and arrested the man for smuggling .
