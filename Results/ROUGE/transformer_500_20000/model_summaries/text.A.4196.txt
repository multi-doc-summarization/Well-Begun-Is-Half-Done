president trump has discussed the political fallout of a potential pardon for paul manafort , whom he believes " has been horribly treated " â€”and understands a pardon is off the table , at least for now , according to rudy giuliani . the president 's personal lawyer made the comments to the new york times on wednesday before elaborating to the washington post . claiming the conversation occurred " three to five weeks ago " then correcting that timeline to june , giuliani said trump had brought up the possibility of a pardon but both giuliani and fellow attorney jay sekulow advised against it , at least before the conclusion of special counsel robert mueller 's investigation . " we sat him down and said you 're not considering these other pardons with anybody involved in the investigation , " giuliani said . that would ostensibly include former national security adviser michael flynn , former campaign adviser george papadopoulos , and campaign aide rick gates , all of whom have pleaded guilty as part of the mueller probe . " he said yes , absolutely , i understand , " giuliani continued . " the real concern is whether mueller would turn any pardon into an obstruction charge . " still , the president has been publicly praising manafort since his tuesday conviction on eight counts of financial fraud . " some of the charges they threw against him , every consultant , every lobbyist in washington probably does , " trump told fox news on thursday , a day after he took to twitter to praise manafort for refusing to " break " for prosecutors . " such respect for a brave man ! " he wrote .
