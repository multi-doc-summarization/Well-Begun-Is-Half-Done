a schenectady man confessed this week to the horrendous crime of murdering a retired nun in her own home , reports news10 . and the albany times union notes that police caught 38-year-old michael briggs thanks in part to a dumb move on his part at the crime scene : he used the toilet and left the seat up . it caught the attention of a detective who wondered why an 82-year-old woman who lived alone would have the seat in that position , and , sure enough , briggs ' fingerprints turned up on the toilet handle . police had other evidence , including surveillance video that showed him leaving his house with a snow shovel and heading toward the victim 's house shortly before she was killed . but the prints ( he left some elsewhere , too ) put him inside the house , and defense lawyers opted to have him plead guilty . briggs will get 30 years to life , and the da does n't expect he 'll ever be a free man again .
