physical anthropologist john verano has seen plenty while working in peru over the last 30 years . what he came across this summer in the village of huanchaquito , however , is " not what we 've seen before , especially on the coast , " he says . locals noticed bones poking out of a sandy ridge in 2011 , and peruvian archaeologist gabriel prieto went to investigate . he was greeted with a shock : the remains of 42 children and 76 llamas sacrificed some 600 years ago in a ritual by the chimú , who controlled part of coastal peru from around 1100 until they were overthrown by the inca in 1470 , phys.org reports . verano and prieto 's expansion of the dig this summer added to the " exciting discovery " as even more remains were found . " it 's not a place where you 'd think to look , " tulane university 's verano says of the site , about 100 yards from a beach . he notes erosion and construction nearby helped reveal the forgotten remains . while verano has come across the bodies of adults captured and killed in peru , children are a rarity , he says . he explains the children may have been killed as a gift to the sea . ( as prieto explained to national geographic in 2011 , " in the north coast of peru , the ocean is very closely tied to agriculture because the temperature of the water can determine whether there will be rain or not . " ) as for the llamas , the chimú may have believed they would transport the children to the afterlife . the discovered bones and teeth are now being analyzed . ( other recent peruvian discoveries include the world 's highest ice age camp and ancient designs in the desert . )
