in the latest effort to make reality out of what is currently science fiction , us officials are looking into the possibility of building a mothership : a large aircraft from which smaller ones take off . " this is the float-the-idea stage of the concept . it 's not the build-me-a-prototype stage , " says an expert . but this month , the pentagon asked companies to envision designs for a drone-carrying cargo plane , afp reports . the request seeks a design that could be demonstrated within four years , cnn reports . the effort has focused on converting aircraft the pentagon already has . " one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft , with minimal modification , to become 'aircraft carriers in the sky , ' " says an official with the defense advanced research projects agency . versions of the idea have been around since the 1920s ; in the 1930s , airships carrying sparrowhawk biplanes crashed and the us dropped the effort for the time being . an underwater version of such a system could come sooner than a flying version , afp notes : the us has already managed to launch a drone from a submarine 's missile tube .
