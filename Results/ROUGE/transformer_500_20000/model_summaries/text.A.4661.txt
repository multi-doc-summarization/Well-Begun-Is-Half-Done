drinking and the sport of curling are n't totally incompatible , the manager of the red deer curling center saysâ€”but most teams wait until after the game . a team that included canadian olympian ryan fry , however , got so drunk before a game saturday that they were banned from a tournament in red deer , alberta , and told never to come back , the cbc reports . " they went out to curl and they were extremely drunk and breaking brooms and swearing and just unacceptable behavior that nobody wants to watch or hear or listen to and it was just 'enough was enough , ' " says facility manager wade thurber . he says there was " some damage in the locker room " and other teams complained about having their stuff kicked around . thurber tells the red deer advocate that the foursome drank so much before the game that staff at the curling club lounge cut them off . they ended up with only three players on the ice because skipper jamie koe was too drunk to even play . thurber says there were complaints from spectators and other teams . fry , who was part of the team that won gold for canada in sochi in 2014 , issued an apology . " i will strive to become a better version of myself while contributing positively to the sport and curling community that i love so much , " he said . the team forfeited the rest of its games in the red deer classic , which is part of the world curling tour , the bbc reports . ( american curlers surprised the world by winning gold in pyeongchang earlier this year . )
