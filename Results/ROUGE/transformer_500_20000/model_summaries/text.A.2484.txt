" sound like your average vegas wedding ? it was n't : they were just 3 , serving as ring bearer and flower girl to fussy 's godmother in minnesota . now 22 , the couple walked down the aisle a second time this weekend—this time as bride and groom—and fussy 's godmother could n't be more pleased , reports abc news . " everybody loves it—especially my godmother , she takes all the credit , " fussy says . and this time around , the event was a little more memorable for the duo : " it was wonderful , " husbyn tells cnn . " as close to perfect as you can get . " husbyn was a bit of a stand-in at that 1995 wedding— " she needed a flower girl , " fussy says of his godmother , who worked with husbyn 's mom . the two did n't meet again until 2007 , when " she sat in front of me in government class , " says fussy , and something about his unique name rang a bell from long ago . she asked her mom , then showed up with a photo from his godmother 's wedding . " i started to laugh because it was the same one we had hanging in the hallway at home , " says fussy , " but i never knew who she was . " within two years they were dating , and the rest is the stuff of fairy tales . " i knew i was going to marry her , " fussy says . ( this couple first kissed in 1938 but did n't marry until 2013 . )
