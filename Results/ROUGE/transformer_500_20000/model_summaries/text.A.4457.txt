lindsey graham is still talking . his latest headline-worthy quote : if he becomes our next president , the very first thing he will do is deploy the military . against ... congress . " i would n't let congress leave town until we fix this , " he said yesterday at new hampshire 's " politics and pies " forum , referring to the budget . " i would literally use the military to keep them in if i had to . we 're not leaving town until we restore these defense cuts . we are not leaving town until we restore the intel cuts . " as vox notes , the quote implies graham would use the military to force congress to actually pass a bill , not simply to vote on one , since his stated goal is to " restore " the cuts . sounds like a " coup " if taken literally , writes amanda taub . and though graham did , indeed , use the word " literally , " his office later clarified to mediaite that the senator " was employing over-the-top humor to win over his audience .
