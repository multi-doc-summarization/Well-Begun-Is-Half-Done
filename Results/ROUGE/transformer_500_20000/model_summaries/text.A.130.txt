it 's the kind of story you fervently hope is an internet hoax : a picture of a bloody fetus next to a woman in a hospital bed makes the rounds online , supposedly offering proof that china forced her to have an abortion in her seventh month of pregnancy . but as the afp reports , it 's " basically true , " or so admitted china today . rights groups say feng jianmei , a woman in the northern shaanxi province , was forced to end her pregnancy after she did n't pay a sizable fine for planning to have a second child . the bbc reports that the us-based all girls allowed spoke to feng 's husband , who told them she was forced to go to the hospital , and restrained once there . " this is a serious violation of the national population and family planning commission 's policies , jeopardizes the population control work , and has caused uneasiness in society , " the provincial government said in an online statement . it recommended that those behind the abortion , who have not been identified , be punished . late-term abortions have been banned in china since 2001 .
