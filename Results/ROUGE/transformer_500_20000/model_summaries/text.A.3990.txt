" members of the audience applauded when it was revealed that 234 prisoners have been put to death while perry has been governor , notes the huffington post . the new yorker in 2009 revealed very serious doubts by scientific experts about evidence against cameron todd willingham , who was executed in 2004 on perry 's watch for a fire that killed willingham 's three daughters . a year after the execution the texas forensic science commission re-examined the case , and its investigator concluded that there was no reliable evidence that arson had been committed .
