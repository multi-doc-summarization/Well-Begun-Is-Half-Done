if you like bananas , it 's time to start savoring them while you still can . a deadly fungus that 's been killing the plant since the 1960s has jumped continents , moving from where it ravaged crops for decades in southeast asia to parts of south asia , australia , the middle east , and africaâ€”and that 's just since 2013 , reports quartz . the so-called " panama " disease is spreading thanks to a single clone of the fusarium fungus , also called tropical race 4 , scientists report in the journal plos pathogens . worse still , one of the world 's most popular bananas , the cavendish , is particularly susceptible to this strain . the soil-borne fungus travels up the plant 's roots , ultimately killing the plant and infesting entire banana plots , which are then contaminated for years . entire swaths of banana plantations in australia , china , the philippines , jordan , mozambique , pakistan , and beyond have been infested in the past two years , putting many farmers and families out of business and cutting them off from a major food source , reports physorg . right now the only way to fight the disease is through strict quarantine , so researchers are trying to spread the word about effective measures in the hopes of getting a step ahead of the fast-spreading fungus before it hits latin america , where most of the world 's bananas are grown . once it lands there , notes quartz , " the days of the iconic yellow fruit are numbered . " ( some researchers hope it 's possible to genetically modify bananas to resist the fungus . )
