there have been many calls for a black james bond , and for a while , there were even rumors idris elba would take on the 007 role . ( rumors elba himself shot down earlier this year . ) but at least one prominent person in the bond universe does n't think that 's a good idea . anthony horowitz , author of the new bond novel trigger mortis—officially commissioned by ian fleming 's estate—says in an extensive interview with the daily mail , " for me , idris elba is a bit too rough to play the part . it ’ s not a color issue . i think he is probably a bit too 'street ' for bond . is it a question of being suave ? yeah . " he adds that there are " other black actors who would do it better , " like adrian lester . sample reaction : " apparently , there ’ s no way for elba , an actor whose literal job it is to assume characters ’ personalities that are not his own , to appear 'suave ' enough to play bond . " dan van winkle , the mary sue " hold on , what ? ! " usa today headline on vulture , dee lockett calls horowitz 's reasoning " casually racist , " noting , " horowitz does n't mind if a black man plays bond , so long as he 's the 'right ' kind of black . " the telegraph rounds up a number of outraged twitter reactions , including this : " are you kidding me ? have you seen that man in a suit ? have you seen that man ? " the world is , however , kind of already getting its first black bond .
