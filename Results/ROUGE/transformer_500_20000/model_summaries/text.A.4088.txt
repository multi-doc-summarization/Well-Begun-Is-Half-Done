it 's tough to comprehend : the fbi says the owner of a dallas-area hospice ordered nurses to increase drug dosages for patients to speed their deaths and maximize profits , reports the ap . the revelations come via kxas-tv , which obtained an affidavit filed to justify a search warrant of novus health services in frisco . the affidavit alleges that owner brad harris , 34 , texted nurses orders such as , " you need to make this patient go bye-bye . " more specifically , it accuses harris of ordering too-high dosages for at least four patients with drugs such as morphine , though it 's unclear whether any patients died as a result . no charges have been filed as the investigation continues . the fbi also accuses of harris , during a meeting with two other execs , of expressing the wish to " find patients who would die within 24 hours . " in regard to one patient in particular , he said " words to the effect of , 'if this fu**** would just die , ' " according to the affidavit . the fbi says harris was worried that if patients lingered too long in hospice care , it would cut into his company 's profits . several employees left the company after the fbi raid , and now harris is suing them for breach of contract , reports a separate kxas story .
