one of roughly 10 employees at yarrabee farms in rural poweshiek county , iowa , the 24-year-old lived in a mobile home on the property , always showed up for work , and got along with his co-workers as he took care of the cows over the course of four years . it was only tuesday that his employers learned his real name . cristhian rivera , accused of killing 20-year-old university of iowa student mollie tibbetts , used a different name associated with an out-of-state government id and matching social security card when he got a job at the dairy farm through a former girlfriend in 2014 , reports the des moines register . when the information was run though the social security administration 's verification service , everything checked out , farm manager dane lang tells the ap . but " our employee was not who he said he was , " adds lang , son of farm co-owner and prominent republican craig lang . " this was shocking to us . " immigration officials now suspect rivera was in the us illegally . per the ap , a facebook page in his name gives his hometown as guayabillo , mexico , a community of less than 500 . the ap adds rivera 's attorney , allan richards , on wednesday said he might argue his client was here legally , saying rivera had been in the us since he was a minor and paid taxes . but richards did say he had n't verified rivera 's immigration status . at a vigil at the university of iowa where tibbetts would 've started her sophomore year on monday , her brother had one request for the hundreds gathered : make a friend . " you can always attribute that friendship â€¦ to my sister , and that would mean the world to her , " he said , per the register .
