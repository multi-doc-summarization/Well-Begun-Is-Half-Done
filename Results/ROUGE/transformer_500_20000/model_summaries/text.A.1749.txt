for more than 150 years , researchers have scratched their heads over a civil war mystery—and now a navy engineer says she 's solved it . rachel lance has been diving deep into the 1864 sinking of the confederate submarine hl hunley , which mysteriously went down shortly after sinking the union 's uss housatonic sloop with a torpedo , reports a hakai magazine article posted at smithsonian.com . over three years , lance—a duke grad student with no experience in forensics , no help from experts who 'd long been on the case , and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what gizmodo calls an " exhaustive … analysis " and finally arrived at a conclusion published in plos one : that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the hunley 's hull and instantly killed the eight crew , whose skeletons were found intact during the sub 's excavation near charleston , sc , in 2000 . lance looked at other theories swirling around the hunley 's fate , including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the housatonic that punctured the sub . she became obsessed , to the point she 'd zone out during meals . " there was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night , and we had no idea how or why , " she tells hakai . her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory . " when blast waves hit an air space , they slow down like a car hitting a wall , " she says . " except in this case , the wall is the surface of the lungs . " a mini replica of the hunley she dubbed the css tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory , per cnn . other researchers remain unconvinced , but hakai says now lance 's theory is " their theory to disprove . " more on her project here . ( the hunley looks a lot better these days . )
