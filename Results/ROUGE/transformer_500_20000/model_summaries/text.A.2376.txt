a now-under-control forest fire that had threatened to encroach upon the abandoned chernobyl nuclear plant may have created a lot of smoke and charred debris , but one thing it did not do is mess up one ukrainian fox 's sandwich-making skills . a radio crew in the pripyat exclusion zone spied the little guy wandering around and laid out some bread and meat for him , abc news reports . before they could say " carnegie deli , " the fox had deftly combined the disparate parts of his soon-to-be lunch into a five-layer sandwich , as seen in the video here . also notable in the video : the animal 's nonchalant attitude about his repast preparation and his admirers . the bbc points out the fox likely did n't seem fazed by the humans because it probably did n't know what to make of them either way : the disaster zone has been more or less abandoned by people since the 1986 explosion . radio free europe adds there 's apparently been a recent uptick in foxes , wolves , and bears in the area . ( meanwhile , wild boars affected by chernobyl have been deemed radioactive . )
