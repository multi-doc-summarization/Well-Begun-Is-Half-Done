today under the heading of " why , god , why ? " : burger king has introduced a new menu item called the whopperito . as you might expect , it 's made up of the whopper ingredients ( beef , cheese , tomatoes , lettuce , mayonnaise , ketchup , pickles , onions ) but inside a tortilla instead of on a bun . grub grade spotted an ad for the whopperito at a pennsylvania burger king , and it 's not yet clear whether the product will get a wider release . some reactions : consumerist 's headline : " the end is nigh : burger king is testing something called the whopperito " most reactions on twitter are along the lines of " wtf ? ! " sample : " there 's nothing in the world i want less than a 'whopperito . ' " but one twitter user points out : " dont act like yall are too good to eat a whopperito yall would f -- -in do it ironically and enjoy it but never admit it . " how does it actually taste ? a grub grade commenter writes , " it has spicy cheese sauce instead of actual cheese . the whole thing is too 'wet'—the cheese sauce mixed with the vegetables ... is a lot of moisture . the proportion of burger to the rest of the ingredients is way off and the cheese sauce is too spicy . and it ’ s hard to get all of the ingredients in one bite . i won ’ t order it again . " as consumerist points out , a twitter user actually described something he called a " whopperito " back in 2012 : it involved getting a whopper from burger king and a burrito grande from taco bell , " and fold the whopper into the burrito . whopperito .
