get ready for another facebook update : next week , the site will start rolling out new face-recognition technology for photos , the huffington post reports . it ’ s “ comforting ” to know that the service won ’ t be automatic , writes larry magid . if the site thinks it recognizes someone , it will ask you for confirmation . ignore it , and no tagging takes place . privacy settings won ’ t change—you ’ ll still be alerted when you ’ re tagged and able to remove any unwanted tags . you ’ ll also be able to opt out of the service , meaning the site won ’ t try to recognize you in your friends ’ pictures . face-recognition technologies are still fairly unreliable , says an expert ; perhaps for that reason , facebook will attempt to identify only those of your friends you contact the most . meanwhile , the site is expected to generate $ 2 billion in revenue this year , insiders tell bloomberg .
