huge , man-eating crocodiles may be hiding throughout the florida wilderness , according to a study published last month in herpetological conservation and biology . the orlando sentinel reports that dna testing on three young crocodiles caught between 2009 and 2014 confirmed them to be nile crocodiles native to africa . nile crocodiles can grow up to 18 feet long and weigh as much as a car , according to a press release . they eat everything from hippos to humans and are believed to be responsible for up to 200 human fatalities a year in africa . the florida everglades have long proven to be a haven for nonnative species—including the burmese python and cuban tree frog . “ here 's another one , " study co-author kenneth kysko says . " but this time it is n't just a tiny house gecko . " researchers say the nile crocodile could thrive in florida , which is bad news for the already tenuous ecosystem in the everglades . nile crocodiles could eat and mate the smaller and less-aggressive native alligators and crocodiles out of existence . not to mention what they could do to livestock and human populations . analysis of one of the captured nile crocodiles—it grew 28 % faster than nile crocodiles in africa—showed they can thrive in florida . and researchers believe there are likely more living in the everglades . it 's unclear how the nile crocodiles got to florida . as their dna does n't match up with nile crocodiles at disney 's animal kingdom and other attractions , it 's most likely they are escaped pets . " they did n't swim from africa , " krysko tells the sentinel .
