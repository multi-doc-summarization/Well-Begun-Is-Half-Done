a group opposed to the teaching of evolution has won a major victory in the deep south—of the korean peninsula . a creationist group has successfully petitioned south korean publishers to remove several references to evolution from high school textbooks , nature reports . the group—set up by the us institute for creation research in the '80s as christianity spread across south korea—says it wants the " error " of evolution removed from textbooks to " correct " students ' view of the world . biologists complain that the government did not consult them on the issue , but merely forwarded the group 's petition to publishers . " when something like this comes to fruition , the scientific community can be caught flat-footed , " a director at the national center for science education tells the new york daily news . " scientists are not by their nature political . " polls show that some 40 % of south koreans do n't accept the theory of evolution , about the same proportion as in the us , but much greater than in canada and in many european countries , io9 notes .
