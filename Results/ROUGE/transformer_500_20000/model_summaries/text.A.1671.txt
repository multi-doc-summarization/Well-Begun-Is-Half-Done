the pacific island nation of palau boasts some stunning sightsâ€”but they do n't want just anybody coming to check them out . the country 's president , tommy remengesau , is planning to introduce legislation restricting hotel development to five-star chains , a move that would effectively make palau a " luxury only " nation , the telegraph reports . remengesau says mass tourism is damaging the environment of palau , which is made up of around 250 islands , and he wants to pursue a " quality not quantity " strategy . " there 's a right way to do things and there 's a wrong way to do things , " says the president , per the bbc . and when it comes to development , he adds , " the best spots around the world have blended in with the environment . " radio new zealand notes that the proposal comes after massive growth in tourism over the last couple of years , most of which involved package tours from mainland china . remengesau says tourism spending actually went up after steps were taken to reduce the number of charter flights from china . ( a tourism slogan in australia is pretty darn explicit . )
