when you hear the name " brent scowcroft , " certain things may come to mind , including " retired lieutenant general " and " heavyweight foreign policy adviser " to several gop presidents , cnn notes . he served as national security adviser to presidents ford and george hw bush , as well as in white house roles during the nixon , reagan , and dubya years . but we can now also add " hillary clinton supporter " to his résumé : just hours after donald trump ripped into clinton during a speech in new york ( see the ap 's fact-check of it here ) , the 91-year-old scowcroft offered his endorsement of the presumptive democratic nominee , underscoring the trepidation that the gop establishment has for trump as its main shot at the white house . " the presidency requires the judgment and knowledge to make tough calls under pressure , " scowcroft said in a statement , per the los angeles times . " [ clinton ] has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time . " what makes his venture into dem territory not a 100 % surprise : scowcroft fell somewhat out of favor with the george w. bush administration when he publicly expressed reservations about the war in iraq . and as cnn notes , scowcroft has had an impact on democratic foreign policy . even president obama recently lauded scowcroft , saying of the man who helped him put together his own security team , " i love that guy , " per the atlantic .
