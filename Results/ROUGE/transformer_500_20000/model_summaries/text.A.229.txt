the nsa 's controversial spying activities have prevented more than 50 terror attacks since 9/11 , the agency 's director told the house intelligence committee today , including attempted bombings of the new york stock exchange and , as previously disclosed , the new york city subway . gen. keith alexander said he 'd go over all 50 cases with congress , but would n't release the information to the public because it would give away nsa secrets . more from the hearing , courtesy of politico and cnn 's liveblog . alexander said 90 % of those cases were disrupted by the prism web spying program . the nsa said that while it has assembled a massive database of call tracking information , it has targeted fewer than 300 numbers or other " identifiers " within it . deputy attorney general james cole stressed that the nsa must get permission from the secret fisa court to access phone data , and must have evidence linking their target to a terrorist organization . " this is not a program that 's off the books that 's been hidden away , " cole said . but cole also said that the fourth amendment did n't apply to phone records , and that people should n't expect privacy for them . nsa deputy director chris inglis said that just 22 people at the nsa are authorized to query the phone database . alexander said the nsa has neither the legal authority nor technical ability to " flip a switch " and listen to a phone conversation . the nsa brass was n't exactly facing an inquisition . committee chairman mike rogers painted the nsa as a victim of " a constant public drumbeat " accusing it of a " laundry list of nefarious things â€¦ all of them wrong . " he said public trust was waning thanks to " inaccuracies , half-truths , and outright lies . "
