watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out . dan hooper , an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the university of chicago , posted a paper in the preprint journal arxiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe , livescience reports . " the presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate , " writes hooper . " as a result , over the next approximately 100 billion years , all stars residing beyond the local group [ of galaxies including the milky way ] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable , but entirely inaccessible , thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them . " therefore , he argues , an advanced civilization may use something like " dyson spheres " —an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction , notes livescience—to harvest a star 's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home . hooper hinges his case on the work of russian astronomer nikolai kardashev , who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps : harvesting resources of their planet , then the nearest star , then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies . so how to spot energy-grabbing aliens ? massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths , which will appear in galaxies ' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is , when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it .
