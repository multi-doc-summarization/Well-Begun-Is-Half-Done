buffalo bills player stevie johnson would really like north korea to " chill out with that nuke talk . " but if it does n't , the wide receiver has suggested a target for kim jong un 's agression : " war is nothing to be played with . i apologize north korea ... ... ..but if y'all do bomb 1st ... bomb foxboro , mass . sincerely , # billsmafia " he tweeted to his 122,000 followers yesterday . foxboro , mass. , is the home of the new england patriots , where the bills have n't had a victory in 13 years , says yahoo ! sports . unsurprisingly , the online backlash to the joke came thick and fast . a few hours later , johnson tweeted something akin to an apology : " i know some of yall took it too serious.. but i have much respect for the pats along with every other nfl team . gon na to be a great # nfl2012 . " then something not so akin to an apology : " patsfans i lo ... like yall also . ask any1 in my fam . ive said theboro is my fav place to play-bkuz you pats fans are live ! but not for long.. "
