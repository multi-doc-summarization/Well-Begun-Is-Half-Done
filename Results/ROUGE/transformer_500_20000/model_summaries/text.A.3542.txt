president trump took another leap into uncharted territory sunday with a demand for the justice department to investigate whether the fbi infiltrated his 2016 campaign . trump tweeted that he would officially demand monday that the department " look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration ! " in what the washington post describes as an effort to avoid a bigger showdown , the justice department bowed to the pressure late sunday , saying its inspector general would investigate whether political motivations had tainted the investigation of alleged russian links to trump 's campaign , which is now being led by special counsel robert mueller . " if anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes , we need to know about it and take appropriate action , " said deputy attorney general rod rosenstein . trump 's tweet followed reports that an fbi informant had talked to trump campaign advisers with alleged links to russia , which the president called a " really big deal " in a tweet saturday , politico reports . analysts described his demand for an investigation of the investigation as unprecedented . " i ca n't think of a prior example of a sitting president ordering the justice department to conduct an investigation like this one , " university of texas school of law professor stephen vladeck tells the new york times . " that 's little more than a transparent effort to undermine an ongoing investigation . "
