killing a bear with a hand-thrown spear is n't an everyday feat—but the government of alberta , canada , is not impressed by the prowess of american hunter josh bowmar . the government promised to introduce a ban on " archaic " and " unacceptable " hunting with spears after video surfaced of bowmar , a former javelin athlete , killing a bear from more than 12 yards away with a 7-foot spear that had a gopro camera attached , the edmonton journal reports . the wounded bear , which had been attracted by a bait bin , ran off . in a youtube video that has now been taken offline , bowmar says he returned the next day and found the body of the bear around 150 feet from where it was hit . the video sparked controversy—and lurid headlines like " warped hunter kills starving bear with seven foot homemade spear " in british tabloids—not just for the manner of the kill , but for bowmar 's celebration , the cbc reports . " that 's going to be some epic footage , " he exclaims . " yeah , i got mad penetration . that 's a dead bear . " the humane society of the us also weighed in , referring to the ohio man as " this year 's version of walter palmer , " the american dentist who killed cecil the lion , notes the dayton daily news . bowmar says he was surprised by the reaction . the kill was " as humane and ethical as one could get in a hunting situation on big game animals , " he says , adding that " no one cares more about these animals than us hunters , especially me , " and that the bear 's hide and meat did not go to waste . ( a california woman angered her neighbors by having a bear shot . )
