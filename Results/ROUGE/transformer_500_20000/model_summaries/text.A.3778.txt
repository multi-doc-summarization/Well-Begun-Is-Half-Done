us-based researchers may have gotten a tad carried away when they announced the discovery of a new , potentially life-sustaining planet a couple weeks back . yesterday , a team of switzerland-based astronomers said their own observations of star gliese 581g didn ’ t back up the american team at all . “ we do not see any evidence for a fifth planet , ” astronomer francesco pepe told sciencenow . the team also said that , if they were forced to draw a conclusion from their data , they would get a negative signal , which implies that the planet isn ’ t there , not that they just haven ’ t been able to find it , notes steinn sigurðsson on his blog . meanwhile , a member of the us team admits that more data is necessary to confirm gliese 581g ’ s existence . “ i would expect that on the time scale of a year or two , this should be settled . ”
