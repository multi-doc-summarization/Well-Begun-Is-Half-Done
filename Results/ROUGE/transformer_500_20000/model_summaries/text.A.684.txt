new research suggests it 's possible ancient humans are responsible for killing off indonesia 's hobbits ( an urge no doubt felt by modern humans who sat through the extended edition of the hobbit ) . starting in 2003 when their remains were first discovered on the island of flores , scientists believed homo floresiensis—who averaged 3.5 feet tall and 75 pounds—lived until as recently as 12,000 years ago , national geographic reports . but a new study published this week in nature found they actually died off sometime between 60,000 and 50,000 years ago—right around the time humans showed up in the area . " the exact cause of the demise of the hominids … is not yet understood , but in my view , may be related to the appearance in the area of the most aggressive of all hominin species , homo sapiens , modern humans , " one expert tells discovery . discovery calls the timing of the hobbits ' disappearance " suspicious , " but the study found no proof they were wiped out by humans , and further excavations on flores are needed . other possible causes for the extinction of homo floresiensis include volcanoes , overhunting of pygmy elephants , and climate change . but it 's not just their death that is mysterious . scientists still do n't know why these real-life hobbits were so small , how they got to flores , or if they 're even a different species . some experts have posited they are actually humans suffering from dwarfism or down syndrome . ( meanwhile , ancient humans having sex with neanderthals may be why we have allergies . )
