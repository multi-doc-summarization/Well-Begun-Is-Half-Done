you 've no doubt come across the hashtag # bringbackourgirls , designed to draw attention to the plight of nigeria 's kidnapped girls . da lovell has , too , but after a few initial retweets , she 's giving it a rest , she writes at the root . the problem is that hashtag activism like this might raise awareness on a superficial level , but it also gives people " a false sense of accomplishment , " writes lovell . " it makes us feel as if the job is done , thereby keeping us from taking a course of action that may be more effective in the long term . " so what 's a concerned citizen to do instead ? lovell suggests taking the time to truly educate yourself about what 's happening in nigeria and neighboring countries , or at least start following people and groups that " are doing work on the ground so you know what â€™ s happening even after twitter moves on to the next trending topic . " problems like this need substantive changes , and a mindless retweet does n't cut it . at campare afrique , jumoke balogun sees a bigger problem : all those tweets give the us and other western governments that much more excuse to expand their military presence in africa , and " this is not good . " but at the independent , felicity morse rounds up the good and the bad and comes down on the side of hashtag activism because of its ability to get the mass media to focus on a neglected subject . it 's a force that " is only going to get more powerful in the future , " she writes . " it 's not to be sniffed at . "
