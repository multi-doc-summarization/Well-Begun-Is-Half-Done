four japanese tourists were reportedly taken to the cleaners by a venice restaurant , and now authorities are looking into the meal . ansa reports the tourists ordered four steaks and a platter of grilled fish—no wine , just mineral water . the spot near st. mark 's square reportedly charged them $ 1,350 for the meal ; they paid the tab then filed a complaint monday . venice mayor luigi brugnaro pledged to get to the bottom of the matter : " if this shameful episode is confirmed , we ’ ll do all we can to punish those responsible . we are for justice , always ! " he said , per the guardian . but ansa notes the story gets a little mushy , with other reports claiming the group ordered hearty " fiorentine " cuts of beef , that the fish dish was sized to serve four , and that they drank aperitifs and pricey amarone wine . a rep for the unnamed restaurant is said to have told local media that he had " no recollection of any problems with japanese customers . " the bbc reports the four males are studying in bologna , and complained upon their return to that city . it 's a bit of a changed tune for brugnaro , who the local reported in november labeled a british family of three " cheapskates " for complaining over a $ 650 lunch they had in the same area ; they alleged the restaurant took advantage of their inability to speak italian and brought them pricey dishes they had n't said they wanted . " what they paid was fair , " brugnaro said . " if you come to venice , you should know that you 're venice , you have to spend some money . " he added , " you should learn italian , a bit of venetian wouldn ’ t hurt either . " ( this tourist died after a " foolish " move in australia . )
