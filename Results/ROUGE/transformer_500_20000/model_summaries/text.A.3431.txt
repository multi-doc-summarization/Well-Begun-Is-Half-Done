look up at the sky on jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years . for the first time since 1866 , a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon , or second full moon of the month , which—like the one visible on new year 's day—will also be a supermoon . got all that ? when the moon is at or near the closest point to earth in its orbit ( aka , a supermoon ) , it appears 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon 's orbit , though the moon will lose brightness as it enters earth 's shadow , according to nasa . because of the way earth 's atmosphere bends light , the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue , something often referred to as a blood moon , making this rare celestial event " a super blue blood moon eclipse , " according to the miami herald . the next blue moon eclipse wo n't occur until 2028 . the eclipse will last for 3.5 hours , with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes , reports sky & telescope . those along the pacific rim from alaska and northwestern canada to central and eastern asia , indonesia , new zealand , and australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night . however , partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central north america , western asia , india , the middle east and eastern europe , per space.com . north american viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of jan. 31 , while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises . not in an ideal viewing area ? the virtual telescope plans to livestream the total eclipse from australia , which you can watch here , per quartz .
