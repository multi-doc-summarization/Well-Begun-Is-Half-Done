with a 3 % " fresh " rating on rotten tomatoes , reviews of the emoji movie could have consisted of repeated strings of the vomiting emoji , thumbs-down emoji , and poop emoji . fortunately for fans of brutal critical drubbings , film critics had to use words ( despite the film 's position that " words are n't cool " ) . here are some of the best takedowns of the new animated film : " children should not be allowed to watch the emoji movie , " writes charles bramesco at the guardian , calling it a " sponsored-content post masquerading as a feature film " and a " force of insidious evil . " it somehow exists to get kids to buy apps without apparently understanding kids and how they actually use emojis . " a viewer leaves the emoji movie a colder person , " the reviewer concludes . " hear that ? it 's the end of the world , " writes johnny oleksinsk at ithe new york post after calling the emoji movie a " new exercise in soulless branding . " at vulture , emily yoshida calls it " one of the darkest , most dismaying films i have ever seen , much less one ostensibly made for children . " the emoji movie is " a very , very dumb thing " full of moments that " sound like they were written by ad agencies , " according to the hollywood reporter , which laments that the film was n't released " via snapchat , where it would vanish shortly after arrival . but even that would n't be fast enough . " finally , alonso duralde at the wrap calls it a " soul-crushing disaster " and " completely shrill and stupid . " this " complete waste of your time " is without " humor , wit , ideas , visual style , compelling performances , a point of view , or any other distinguishing characteristic . "
