condom king trojan managed to get its new vibrator commercial on tv—and not just during the wee hours—by doing one simple thing : not referring to the product as a vibrator . apparently referring to it by its proper name ( “ vibrating tri-phoria ” ) is ok. trojan also agreed not to show the actual product : instead , it shows multiple boxes , all of which vibrate jubilantly as the voiceover promises side effects including “ screams of ecstasy , curled toes , a sudden glow , and intense waves of pleasure , ” the new york times reports . “ no matter how liberal you are , a little kid doesn ’ t need to hear the word ‘ vibrator , ’ ” says an mtv exec . really ? wonders adrian chen at gawker : “ we know kids are dumb , but do they not understand how nouns and verbs work ? can they not comprehend the fact that something which vibrates is , technically , a ‘ vibrator ’ ? we are headed down a slippery semantic slope , here . by this logic , trojan could advertise a new double-headed dildo—the duojoy—by marketing it as the ‘ dual-penetrating duojoy . ’ ”
