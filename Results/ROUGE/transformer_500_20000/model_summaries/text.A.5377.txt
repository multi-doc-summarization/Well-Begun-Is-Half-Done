the latest in the attempt to better define aurora shooter james holmes : he apparently had a lot of target practice , is n't so smart , and may have a thing for prostitutes . from the most to least concrete : based on holmes ' " unusually high " hit rate , police believe he had extensive target practice in advance of the shootings , reports the los angeles times . to be able to kill or wound 70 moving targets in a dark theater cloaked in gas is no easy feat , and the kick from the shotgun ( used to shower the theater with buckshot , or something like it ) and glock ( which he switched to after his semiautomatic ar-15 jammed ) only added to the difficulty level . such a hit rate under those circumstances would be " unusually high for someone new to this , " said one law enforcement official . so he was a skilled shooterâ€”but was he brilliant ? his neuroscience career path , his federal grant , that science camp video may indicate so , but the man holmes listed as his camp mentor calls him a " mediocre " student ; another neuroscientist says he was considered a " dolt , " reports usa today . he " should not have gotten into the summer program . i 've heard him described as brilliant . this is extremely inaccurate . " as for that $ 26,000 grant , " everyone has one.there is nothing elite about it . " ( business insider speculates that the grant money could have paid for his weapons cache . ) and then there 's the latest from tmz , which claims holmes frequented prostitutes in the months before the attack . click to hear from three women holmes supposedly " reviewed " online .
