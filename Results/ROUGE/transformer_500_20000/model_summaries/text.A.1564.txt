it was n't the koala 's fault , says an australian woman who was savaged by one of the planet 's cutest and most cuddly-appearing creatures . according to 7news adelaide , mary anne forster was walking her two dogs a couple of weeks ago when they dragged her toward a koala at the bottom of a tree ; she got caught in the middle when the koala attacked the dogs . " obviously the koala felt very threatened because it attached itself with its mouth , jaws , to my leg and bit very hard , bit very deeply , " she says . forster , who had to put her fingers in the koala 's mouth to make it let go , needed 12 stitches and spent four days in the hospital after the attack . the bite " became very infected , it was very swollen and painful , " she says . the koala had good reason to feel threatened , mashable reports : australian authorities estimate that 110 koalas are killed in dog attacks every year , and an environmental department spokesperson warns that people who see them in the wild should " just leave them aloneâ€”certainly do n't let dogs go near them because they will fight back , they 've got big claws and big teeth . " ( scientists using thermal cameras have discovered why koalas hug trees . )
