the incredible hulk was feeling pumped up this weekâ€”but with iv fluid , not testosterone-induced rage . on wednesday night , lou ferrigno posted on social media a picture of himself wearing a green hospital gown ( naturally ) and hooked up to an iv in a medical center in santa monica , calif. , noting he " went in for a pneumonia shot and landed up here with fluid in my bicep . " the 67-year-old actor implied someone administered the shot ( apparently a vaccine , usa today notes ) the wrong way , warning others to " keep an eye on who 's giving the shot and make sure they not only swab the spot correctly but that you watch the needle come out of the package . " although ferrigno did n't say what shot he received , people notes that , per the cdc , there are two types of pneumonia vaccines , both suggested for older adults and one of which can produce swelling at the site where the shot was given . all appears to be well now with the star : on friday morning , he tweeted a picture of himself hanging out with rocky actor dolph lundgren and others at an mma event the night before in los angeles . ( ferrigno 's wife was one of many who lobbed accusations against bill cosby . )
