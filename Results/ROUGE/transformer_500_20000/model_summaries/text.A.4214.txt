another tidbit from michele bachmann ’ s media victory lap today : on meet the press , gawker notes , bachmann dodged ( and dodged again… and again… ) david gregory ’ s repeated attempts to get her to address her 2004 comments that being gay is “ personal enslavement. ” instead , she consistently said , “ i am running for the presidency of the united states , ” and insisted she doesn ’ t judge gay people . she also would not call a gay couple with adopted children a “ family , ” instead insisting that such questions “ aren ’ t what people are concerned about right now. ” though , gregory noted , she once called such issues “ defining political issues . ”
