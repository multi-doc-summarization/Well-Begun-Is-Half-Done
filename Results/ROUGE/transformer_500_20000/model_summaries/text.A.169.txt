a fun foray into finding out more about her ancestry through a popular genealogy website led to a shocking revelation for 72-year-old denice juneski : she was n't related to any of her own relatives—at least not the ones she 'd grown up knowing . kare reports that as minnesota 's juneski was puzzling over her test results from 23andme , a woman in a nearby town in wisconsin took her own dna test . linda jourdeans ' results showed that " m. mayer " was her mother—but that was n't the woman who had raised her , she tells kare . the murkiness of this all soon cleared up : juneski and jourdeans had been somehow switched at birth sometime after being born on dec. 19 , 1945 , at bethesda hospital in st. paul , minn . the news offered context for things both women had long noticed : juneski was the only blonde among redheads and brunettes , while jourdeans , a redhead , was surrounded by lighter-haired kin . juneski said she also felt out of place in a family of athletes , while jourdeans was the only athlete in her family . the women tracked each other down in april and have since met a few times , and they 're celebrating their special new bond . " i consider it a gift , " juneski says . together , the women visit one other person at her memory care facility : 99-year-old marianne mayer , the woman who raised juneski and is jourdeans ' biological mother . rochelle nielsen , juneski 's biological mother and the mom who raised jourdeans , died of cancer when jourdeans was 17 . ( were these birth switches done on purpose ? )
