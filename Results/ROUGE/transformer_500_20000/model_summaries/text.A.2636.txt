harry truman called the 80th congress " do-nothing " in 1948 , but they look like massive overachievers compared to today 's crop of lawmakers , a usa today analysis finds . the 112th congress has passed just 61 bills out of 3,914 into law this year , putting it on course to be the most unproductive since year-end records began in 1947 . only 90 bills became law last year . one post-world war ii year , 1995 , had an even lower total than 2011 , but the republican-controlled congress managed to produce 245 laws the following year with a democratic president . after two years marked by partisanship and failure to agree on issues including debt reduction and drought relief , the 112th congress will conclude after election day and most people will be happy to see it go , according to the latest gallup poll . the poll found that just 10 % of americans think members of congress are doing a good job , tying a record low set in february of this year . the highest approval rating this congress has received came in may 2011 , when it reached the dizzying heights of 24 % approval , notes politico .
