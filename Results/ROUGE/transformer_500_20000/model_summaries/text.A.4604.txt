nadia murad , a 23-year-old yazidi woman who survived captivity as an isis sex slave , was named a un goodwill ambassador friday—the first time a human trafficking survivor was named as such , time reports . murad has another distinction : a high-profile human rights lawyer helping her cause of bringing isis criminals to justice . that attorney is amal clooney , wife of george clooney , and she tells people the couple conferred before she decided to take on the case . " this is something i discussed with my husband , " she says , adding that george was also " moved " when he spoke to murad and that they know the risks . but , clooney adds , " i do n't think anyone can feel that they 're being courageous compared to what nadia is doing . i met her and i just thought , i ca n't walk away from this . " clooney gave a heartfelt speech at the un friday , relaying the story of how murad was one of 6,700 yazidis captured by isis in 2014 . her mom and six brothers were executed , and murad was pushed into a revolving door of isis " owners " who abused and raped her , once until she was unconscious . she escaped after " three hellish months , " per nbc news , though she still gets threats from isis , and she 's now working with clooney to bring her attackers to justice for crimes against humanity—a daunting task , as iraq is n't part of the international criminal court . " i am ashamed , as a supporter of the un , that states are failing to prevent or even punish genocide , because they find that their own interests get in the way , " clooney told the un . ( barbara walters has picked clooney as her " most fascinating person . " )
