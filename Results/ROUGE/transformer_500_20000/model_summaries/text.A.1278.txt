us employers notched another solid month of hiring in march by adding a higher-than-expected 215,000 jobs , driven by large gains in the construction , retail , and health care industries , the ap reports . despite the jump , the labor department said friday that the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 % from 4.9 % . but that increase includes some good news : more americans came off the sidelines to look for work , though not all found jobs . the figures suggest that employers remain confident enough in their business prospects to add staff , even as overall growth has slowed since last winter . steady hiring is also contributing to higher pay , which rose a modest 2.3 % from a year earlier to $ 25.43 . that figure has increased since the early years of the recovery but is below a peak of 2.6 % reached in december . sluggish wage growth has been a weak spot in the economy and a source of frustration for many workers since the great recession ended in 2009 . paychecks typically grow at a 3.5 % pace in a strong economy . construction firms added 37,000 jobs , likely aided by warmer weather . that helped offset another month of job losses in manufacturing , which has been hit by slower growth overseas , and mining , which includes the oil and gas drilling sector . low oil prices have cost that industry 185,000 jobs since september 2014 . meanwhile , the moneybeat team at the wall street journal has deemed friday " datageddon " for all of the additional info scheduled to be released , including manufacturing data from the us , china , and europe and an update from the university of michigan 's consumer sentiment index .
