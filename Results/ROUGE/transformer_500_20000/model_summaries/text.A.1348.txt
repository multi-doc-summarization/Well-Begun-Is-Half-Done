" he also said the complaint was too general and if a court accepted it , it could place " many , if not all " such zoning laws under scrutiny , the st. louis post-dispatch reports . the couple 's lawyer , who says " this is one of the most important property rights cases in the country right now , " says the couple will appeal . he tells the riverfront times the case could go to the supreme court . " this is a couple with health problems facing gross penalties for what they 've chosen not to plant on their personal property . "
