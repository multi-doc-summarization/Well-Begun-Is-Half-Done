the baltimore landscape is becoming more dire as police and demonstrators continue to clash following today 's funeral for freddie gray , who died while in police custody on april 12 . and when protests about gray 's death initially started turning violent on saturday , local sports broadcaster brett hollander took to twitter to highlight damaged storefronts , proclaiming in one tweet that " protests should not violate the basic freedoms of non-protestors . " that 's when baltimore orioles coo john angelos stepped in , throwing out his own perspective with a series of tweets that usa today 's for the win says amounts to " a qualified and brilliant defense of those protesting . " " brett , speaking only for myself , i agree with your point that the principle of peaceful , non-violent protest and the observance of the rule of law is of utmost importance in any society , " he begins , citing mlk , gandhi , and nelson mandela as examples of " great opposition leaders . " angelos ' " greater source of personal concern , outrage and sympathy , " however , is n't on the smashed windows , or even on the damaging acts themselves . instead , he points out " the past four-decade period during which an american political elite … have plunged tens of millions of good , hard-working americans into economic devastation , and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every american ’ s civil rights protections . " to wit : " an unfairly impoverished population [ is ] living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state . " ( head over to angelos ' twitter feed to read what else he had to say . )
