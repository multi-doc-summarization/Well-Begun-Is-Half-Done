to a craft beer aficionado , the only sin worse than drinking a bud would be if your favorite brewery sold out to the company that owns it . that 's the situation that has fans of the wicked weed brewery now crying " treachery , " per the washington post , which reports on the news that the asheville , nc , institution has teamed up with anheuser-busch inbev " as a strategic partner . " the reason for the move by wicked weed—which the citizen-times notes was founded in 2012 by walt and luke dickinson and friends ryan , rick , and denise guthy—is , as walt dickinson explains , to stay competitive . a fellow craft brewery owner in oregon backs him up , noting that his own brewery 's acquisition by ab inbev offered him access to better ingredients and distribution . but the buyout has craft beer fans livid , especially after budweiser 's 2015 and 2016 super bowl ads that mocked craft beer drinkers . wicked weed 's facebook announcement was met with angry and sad emoji , with " very disappointed " and " disheartened " just a sampling of the negative comments . some of wicked weed 's distributors and partners are n't happy , either , with denver 's black project brewery cutting its ties to ww—not because it does n't love the beer , but because it believes ab inbev has " unethical practices " and " intends to systematically destroy american craft beer as we know it . " other commenters on wicked weed 's facebook page say they will remain loyal fans . " at the end of the day , great beer will win , " walt dickinson tells the citizen-times . ( walmart recently took heat on the craft beer front . )
