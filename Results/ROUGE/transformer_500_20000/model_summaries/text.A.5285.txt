president trump ended his night by congratulating doug jones , and began his morning by tweeting that he essentially knew jones would be the victor . " the reason i originally endorsed luther strange ( and his numbers went up mightily ) , is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election , " he tweeted . " i was right ! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him ! " politico scratched its head at the " deck was stacked against " moore part , noting alabama ranks as one of america 's most conservative states and has n't voted a democrat into the senate since 1992 ( the last time it went democrat for president was 1976 ) . the hill reports trump was n't the only one to react to the moore news by tweeting about strange . in what it calls a " rare tweet , " matt drudge wrote : " luther strange would have won in a landslide ... just too much crazy in nerve racking times . there is a limit ! " in a second tweet , trump offered his alabama takeaway : " if last night 's election proved anything , it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate .
