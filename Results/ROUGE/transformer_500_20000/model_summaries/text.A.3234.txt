" and the increasing cost of cars—the average price is now more than $ 33,000—is coming as a surprise to people buying their first automobile in a decade . " we really become unhappy when we find any defect or are told we have to take our car in to have some kind of recall taken care of , even if it does n't cost us anything , " the director of the survey tells nbc . overall , customers tend to be more satisfied with asian- and european-made cars than their american-made counterparts .
