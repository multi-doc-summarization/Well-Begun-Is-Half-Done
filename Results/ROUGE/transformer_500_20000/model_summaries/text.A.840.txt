there 's plenty of speculation in dc about whether president trump might fire special counsel robert mueller . but mike allen of axios reports on another strategy being explored by the president 's legal team : appoint a second special counsel to investigate mueller 's investigation . the story suggests that trump 's attorneys trust mueller himself but not others in the justice department . for example , they point to a fox news story monday detailing how the wife of a justice department official named bruce ohr worked for the company behind the infamous anti-trump dossier that emerged during the election . ohr was recently demoted for concealing his own meetings with the company , fusion gps . " the department of justice and fbi can not ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests , " trump attorney jay sekulow tells axios . " these new revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate . " it 's not clear how likely this is to happen , but attorney general jeff sessions has previously floated the idea of a second special counsel to cover a wide range of gop concerns . meanwhile , the washington post has a profile of trump 's legal trio : sekulow ( the tv presence ) , ty cobb ( a white house attorney ) , and john dowd ( trump 's personal attorney ) . they " serve not only as trump 's lawyers but also as his strategists , publicists , therapistsâ€”and , based on dowd 's claim that he wrote a controversial presidential tweet , ghostwriters , " per the post .
