most of the water that fills the world 's oceans—and makes up more than half of the human body—may have started out as comets , not asteroids as current theories hold , according to new research . scientists using the herschel telescope found that unlike other comets studied , the comet hartley 2 contains water with the same chemical signature as water on our planet , suggesting that cometary impacts brought the water that covered the rocky and dry early earth , the bbc reports . hartley 2 is believed to have formed in the kuiper belt , not far outside the solar system . comets studied earlier came from the much more distant oort cloud and had a different chemical composition , leading scientists to believe only 10 % of earth 's water could have come from comets . " it was a big surprise when we saw the ratio was almost the same as what we find in the earth 's oceans , " the lead researcher tells reuters . " it means it is not true any more that a maximum of 10 % of water could have come from comets . now , in principle , all the water could have come from comets . "
