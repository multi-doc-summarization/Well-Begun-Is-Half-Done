willie and carol fowler were prepared to lose their deposits . their daughter canceled her georgia wedding with just 40 days ' notice , and the venue , food , and entertainment were already paid for . then willie had " a vision , " his wife tells abc news . " i was in the process of canceling out the venue and he said , 'no , what we 'll do is donate it to hosea feed the hungry . ' " their daughter had volunteered for the organization , which helps homeless people in the atlanta area , when she was younger . and that 's how , on sept. 15 , the fowler family celebration of love was born . two hundred guests were bused to villa christina for a four-course meal complete with coconut shrimp and salmon ( the 50 kids in attendance got chicken fingers ) . the family hopes to get sponsors and make it an annual event , carol tells wbur . a rep for hosea feed the hungry said the nonprofit initially thought the fowlers were pulling their leg : " it 's a very creme de la creme wedding venue , so to say that you 're going to host 200 homeless individuals at villa christinaâ€”it sounds like a prank call . " the fowlers ' daughter attended the event , and her dad says it was a " bittersweet but rewarding " experience ; her mom tells today tamara found it " surreal but incredibly rewarding . " carol has this advice : " if you have canceled an event , do not walk away . pick up the phone and call your favorite charity and offer it to them . we 're regular , working people and anybody can do this . this is not star stuff . " ( in boston , a homeless man who did a very good deed is being handsomely rewarded . )
