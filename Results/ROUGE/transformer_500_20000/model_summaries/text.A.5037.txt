if you had big plans this weekend , david meade regrets to inform you that the world will be ending saturday . meade , a christian numerologist and self-described " researcher , " says sept. 23 is foretold in the bible 's book of revelation as the day a series of catastrophic events will begin , and as a result , " a major part of the world will not be the same , " the washington post reports . the bible prophecies a woman " clothed with the sun " and a " crown of 12 stars " giving birth to a boy who will " rule all the nations " while she fights off a seven-headed dragon . the woman , meade says , is the constellation virgo , which on saturday will be positioned under nine stars and three planets , per popular mechanics . the baby boy will be the planet jupiter , which will be moving out of virgo on that night . according to meade , who says he studied astronomy at an unspecified university in kentucky , the great change in our world will be the result of the arrival of nibiru , a planet famous in conspiracy circles but which astronomers say does n't exist . david morrison , a senior space scientist at nasa , says that if nibiru were really on a collision course with earth , we would have seen it by now . " it would be bright , " he says , per the post . " it would be easily visible to the naked eye . " but that 's not dissuading meade , who points to the fact that sept. 23 falls 33 days after last month 's total solar eclipse as proof of his prophecy . " jesus lived for 33 years . the name elohim , which is the name of god to the jews , was mentioned 33 times [ in the bible ] , " meade says . " it 's a very biblically significant , numerologically significant number . "
