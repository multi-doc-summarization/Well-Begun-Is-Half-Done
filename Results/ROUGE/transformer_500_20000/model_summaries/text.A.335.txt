thou shalt restore the guadalupe-nipomo dunes to their natural state once filming wraps up . that ’ s the commandment given to movie director cecil b. demille , who filmed his epic the ten commandments in the sand dunes on the central california coast in the early 1920s , kcbx reports . apparently , though , he didn ’ t follow through . now , archaeologists are using aircraft to get a bird ’ s-eye view of the dunes to unearth more treasures of the movie ’ s set—a giant sphinx was found earlier this year , but plenty more remains from a " lost city " that boasted a huge temple , four more of those sphinxes , massive statues , a 750-foot-long wall , and amenities for somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 people who worked on the film . demille reportedly called the spot “ perhaps the most unpleasant location in cinema history , ” according to outside . after another flyover in the next few weeks by the company applied earthworks , the search will resume on the ground , archaeologist m. colleen hamilton tells kcbx . " we have one historical photograph of the camp itself and we 're trying to align that with features that are currently on the ground , " says hamilton . doug jenzen of the nonprofit dunes center in guadalupe tells outside that minerals in the sand— “ a natural desiccant ” —have preserved the artifacts remarkably well . however , he says , the sands of the dunes are shifting , leaving the old movie props endangered . “ it ’ s disappearing so fast , ” he says . as for the commandment that demille restore the area after filming : instead , per outside , he supposedly blew it up with dynamite to spite rival directors . ( in the real egypt , archaeologists are pretty excited about what might be a hidden room in king tut 's tomb . )
