in what burger king says is a move to " be connected to pop culture , " the chain is ditching its 40-year-old " have it your way " slogan in favor of " be your way , " which will be rolled out across the us in the weeks ahead . " we want to be an iconic brand way beyond quick-service restaurants , " a burger king exec tells usa today , which notes that previous bk slogans have included " are n't you hungry , " " we do it like you do it , " " get your burger 's worth , " and " where 's herb ? " the switch to the " grammatically-questionable " slogan comes amid other odd fast-food marketing moves , including happy , the anthropomorphic " living nightmare " that is mcdonald 's new happy meal character , writes mark berman at the washington post . but marketing experts are n't sure whether burger king 's attempt to be hip will do much to boost sales . " the problem is that people do n't see themselves as living the burger king lifestyle , " the chief of brand consulting firm ries & ries tells the ap . " you 've got to be realistic with the place that your brand holds in real life . " ( one part of that " burger king lifestyle " appears to be the chain 's new breakfast offeringâ€”burgers . )
