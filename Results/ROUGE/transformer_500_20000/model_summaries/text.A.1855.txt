the " angst " travelers feel at overcrowded gates may soon be eased at united airlines terminals , an exec for the airline says . that 's because united just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular " passenger pain point , " as cnbc puts it , by changing up its departure protocol : the number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two , and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group ( one of six in total , including pre-boarders ) is announced . " it 's too congested , " a ua rep says of the current procedure , which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones . forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app , meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it 's time to board . over the past year , united test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights , ending up with this system , which is similar to the way american , delta , and southwest queue up . united has been using the procedure at lax since winter and will now implement it at all locations , per usa today . it 's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups , which includes pre-boarders ( e.g. , families with young kids , service members ) , first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2 , and then everyone else in groups 3 , 4 , and 5 . " the boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved , " another ua rep says in a statement , noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements . ( united had some " unfortunate dog incidents " earlier this year . )
