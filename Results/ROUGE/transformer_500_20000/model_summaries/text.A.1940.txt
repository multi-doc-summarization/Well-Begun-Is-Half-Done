the washington redskins are having a rough time of it today : things started with a crash this morning involving two of the team 's buses , which were en route to play the vikings in minneapolis , reports the ap . a police escort in minnesota crashed into a guardrail around 8:30am ; the team bus immediately behind it braked to avoid hitting the cop car , but second bus rear-ended the first . no injuries . arriving in minneapolis , the team was met with chants of " who are we ? not your mascot ! " from some 3,200 protesting native americans who were none too happy with the " redskins " moniker . " my hubby did not fight in iraq to be called a 'redskin , ' read one sign . the protest raised familiar arguments , with one redskins fan calling the name a " respectful " one in which native americans should " take pride . " the name is nothing more than " a racial slur , " counters one democratic rep at the protest , citing minnesota 's " 11 proud tribal nations . this was a government-funded policy of genocide . " indeed , as the washington post reports , minneapolis is home to a sizable native american presence , perhaps contributing to the size of the demonstration . the issue is compounded by the university of minnesota , which currently leases its football stadium to the vikings for a hefty $ 300,000 per game . with 1,100 students who identify as native american , the university had in august demanded that the redskins limit use of the mascot , logo , and team name during today 's game .
