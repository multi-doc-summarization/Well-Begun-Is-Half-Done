there 's another reason for you to love kenny g. not only does he provide the world with smooth saxophone jazz , he also helped provide the world with the starbucks frappuccino , at least according to the musician himself . he was an early starbucks investor , he explained this week in an interview with bloomberg , and he noticed that " starbucks didn ’ t have anything but coffee " while another coffee chain , coffee bean , " had something called 'blended ' that was a sweet drink , and people were lined up around the block . i would always call [ starbucks ceo ] howard [ schultz ] and say , 'howard , there ’ s this thing that they do there that 's like a milkshake or whatever . ' ... so i 'd like to think that i was partially responsible " for the drink . and , of course , now , the frappuccino is his favorite starbucks beverage , he says . and , though eater cites wikipedia in pointing out that starbucks may actually have bought the rights to the frappuccino when the chain bought another chain , the coffee connection , in 1994 , a starbucks rep tells abc news , " kenny has been a dear friend of starbucks since the beginning of the company and we are very appreciative of everyone , including kenny , who 've been a part of the success of frappuccino . " ( the rep also says two starbucks partners began working on what would be the frappuccino in 1993 ; it launched nationally two years later . ) as for how he became a starbucks investor , kenny said his uncle—possibly schultz 's first investor , per kenny—suggested he invest and also try to sell his cds there . and in 1994 , one of his albums became the first cd starbucks ever sold . " that was the experiment , to see if they could sell music at the counter , and it worked really well . " ( here 's what a starbucks does to the neighborhood . )
