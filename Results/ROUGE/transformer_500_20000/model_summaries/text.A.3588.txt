the los angeles times sheds more light on how navy yard gunman aaron alexis was able to get secret-level security clearance from the navy , despite the fact that he had been arrested in 2004 for an incident involving a gun . alexis did not mention the incident on the security questionnaire he filled out three years later , but the navy 's office of personnel management learned about it after doing a fingerprint check . he was asked about it and claimed all he did was deflate a man 's tires . in reality , he shot out the man 's tires , according to the police report filed in seattle . alexis said he did not disclose the incident because the charge was dismissed and his lawyer had told him it would be wiped from his record . investigators did not interview anyone else about the incident , the washington post reports , and seattle police refused to provide the records related to the incident , according to the personnel office . so the navy cleared alexis in march 2008 based on what it knew . ( the lat notes the only red flag was his credit history . ) the full picture of the 2004 incident did n't emerge until after the navy yard shootings , says a senior navy official . now , the secretary of the navy has recommended to defense secretary chuck hagel that security reviews in the future include all police reportsâ€”even those that did not result in charges , the new york times reports .
