" they said they were traveling and their phones and wallets were stolen in new york , " she tells the bangor daily news . they left job applications noting neither had finished high school , but no address or phone number . " it did n't add up , " says stephenson , 26 . “ it seemed odd for teen girls not to have cellphones , nowadays , ” she tells yahoo . when stephenson got home , she searched their names on facebook and found the girls , 14 and 16 , had disappeared in maine a day earlier on oct. 25 , along with a car belonging to the younger girl 's mother , and may have been heading for south carolina . stephenson reached out to the older girl 's mother and then to local police . the next day , after receiving other concerned calls , authorities found the girls panhandling in front of a strip mall about 100 miles away in waldorf , md . an officer took them to a district station where a social worker picked them up . they were reunited with their mothers on oct. 28 . while the younger 's girl 's mother drove her car back home , the other woman took the girls to the blue crab grill , where they thanked stephenson in person . on facebook , the mother praised stephenson as " a hero—a person who trusted her gut when she saw two young girls all alone and helped . " but stephenson is rejecting the title . “ i don ’ t feel like a hero , ” she tells yahoo . “ i just feel like a normal person who needed to speak up and did . " ( this teen just discovered that he 'd been " missing " for 13 years . )
