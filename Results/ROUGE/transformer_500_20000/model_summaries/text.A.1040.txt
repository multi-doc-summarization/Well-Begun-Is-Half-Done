pope francis is days away from releasing what the guardian predicts will be " his most radical statement " yet , and he says it is n't just for catholics . francis will be accompanied by an atheist climate scientist and a greek orthodox theologian , as well as a vatican cardinal , when he releases his long-anticipated letter on the environment on thursday , the ap reports . the encyclical , a rare papal " teaching letter , " is expected to focus on climate change , humanity 's role in causing it , and its devastating and disproportionate effects on the world 's poor , reports the new york times , which notes that francis has long been outspoken on environmental issues and told reporters earlier this year that " man has slapped nature in the face . " in a recent speech seen as a preview to the encyclical , francis made it clear that he believes climate change and the suffering of the poor is the result of capitalism and overconsumption , the guardian reports . " much of the world remains in poverty , despite abundant resources , while a privileged global elite controls the bulk of the world 's wealth and consumes the bulk of its resources , " he said . climate scientists say since the issue has become an ideological and partisan one as much as it is a scientific one , the papal letter could do more than international negotiations this year to reduce emissions , usa today reports . ( a us conservative group claims francis has been " misled " on the issue , and staunch catholic rick santorum says he finds the church leader hard to listen to . )
