a coastal virus that can cause a rash and mild fever has officially infected a person for the first time , npr reports . scientists say it took 18 months to figure out that a florida teen who got sick during the zika outbreak of 2016 actually had the keystone virus , which is carried by mosquitos . " we could n't identify what was going on , " j. glenn morris , head of the emerging pathogens institute at the university of florida , tells wusf . " we screened this with all the standard approaches and it literally took a year and a half of sort of dogged laboratory work to figure out what this virus was . " there was n't even a test to detect keystone virus in humans . the 16-year-old boy had a fever and a bad rash , but not the encephalitis ( or brain inflammation ) that a group of viruses including keystone can cause in animals . first seen in america in 1964 , keystone is known to infect " animal populations along coastal regions stretching from texas to the chesapeake bay , " per a university of florida health statement . scientists have long suspected there are human cases , but the new study in clinical infectious diseases confirms it . " the infection may actually be fairly common in north florida , " says lead study author john lednicky . " it 's one of these instances where if you do n't know to look for something , you do n't find it . "
