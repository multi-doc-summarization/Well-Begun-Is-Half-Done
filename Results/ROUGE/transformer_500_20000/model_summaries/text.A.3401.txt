eat , pray , love looks lovely but lacks both the spice and the depth of the best-selling memoir it 's based on , say critics . julia roberts stars as a jaded new york divorcee traveling the world to seek enlightenment . roberts ' liz says she wants to move outside her comfort zone , writes kirk honeycutt at the hollywood reporter , but as she journeys through italy , india , and indonesia , " the film never ventures , even once , into a situation that does not reek of comfy familiarity . " the movie " is shameless wish-fulfillment , a harlequin novel crossed with a mystic travelogue , " complains roger ebert at the chicago sun-times , though he notes that the overwhelmingly female audience he watched it with appeared quite moved . roberts manages to make the " 2 hours and 15 minutes of eating , praying and loving pleasant enough , " writes roger moore at the orlando sentinel , who decides eat , pray , love " isn â€™ t a bad movie , just a spiritually dead one . " roberts is a great choice to play liz but " her warmth , coupled with javier bardem 's scruffy sexiness " as love interest felipe , are n't enough to compensate for " the folded-map flatness of this production , " writes lisa schwarzbaum at entertainment weekly .
