if today 's questions from the conservative wing of the supreme court are any guide , the landmark voting rights act of 1965 is doomed . in fact , writes tom goldstein at scotusblog , expect a 5-4 decision in favor of striking down section 5 of the act , one of its core provisions . it requires nine mostly southern states to get federal permission when they want to change voting rules , and antonin scalia and others suggested the measure is no longer necessary , reports the new york times . scalia called it a " perpetuation of racial entitlement , " anthony kennedy wanted to know how long alabama had to live " under the trusteeship of the united states government , " and chief justice john roberts wondered whether people in the south were more racist than those in the north . the court 's liberal wing made the case that the act is still necessary , with stephen breyer saying the " old disease " of racism , along with the desire to keep minorities from voting , remains . if the court strikes down the act , it would likely require congress to come up with a new formula for it , but both the times and scotusblog think it 's unlikely that would be politically possible .
