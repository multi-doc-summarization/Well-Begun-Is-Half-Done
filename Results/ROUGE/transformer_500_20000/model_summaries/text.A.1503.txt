as one new york city institution wrestles with high-profile molestation accusations , another finds itself the target of outcry over the " sexualization " of a young girl—in a painting . the metropolitan museum of art says it will not take down the 1938 painting " thérèse dreaming " by the french artist balthus , though 7,000 people have asked that it do so via the petition site care2 . the petition started by mia merrill describes the work as " an evocative portrait of a prepubescent girl relaxing on a chair with her legs up and underwear exposed , " and calls it " disturbing " that the museum would knowingly display such a sexualized image in our " current climate . " as for the knowingly part , she notes that the met paired a 2013 exhibit of balthus ' work with a sign explaining some of the pieces could be " disturbing " to viewers . a 2013 guardian article indicates " thérèse dreaming " was part of that exhibit . merrill writes that " if the met had the wherewithal to reference the disturbing nature of balthus , they understand the implications of displaying his art . " the new york post reports the museum on sunday said the painting would remain hanging , with a rep saying , " moments such as this provide an opportunity for conversation . " the museum 's description of the piece notes that thérèse blanchard , balthus ' neighbor in paris , was 12 or 13 when she was painted . the paris review reports the late balthus was asked about the " provocative poses " he painted young girls in , and replied , " it is how they sit . " in his review of the 2013 exhibition for the new yorker , peter schjeldahl had this to say : " i kept thinking of a line by oscar wilde : ' a bad man is the sort of man who admires innocence . ' " ( a us couple has been forced to give up their $ 1.75 million painting . )
