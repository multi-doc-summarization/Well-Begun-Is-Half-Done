are you a " digital native " or a " digital immigrant , " and does it make a difference ? research recently published in the teaching and teacher education journal indicates the concept of so-called digital natives—aka , those slotted into the " millennials " category and younger , and often thought to be masters of technology and multitasking—is a myth , reports discover magazine . why it 's important for this myth to be shattered , scientists say , is because companies and educators have been urged to revamp their processes and environments to cater to the supposedly more tech-savvy younger generation , quartz notes . " the answer is not how we can adapt [ to the younger generation ] , " says lead author paul kirschner , an open university educational psychology professor . " we have to treat people as human , cognitive learners and stop considering one specific group to have special powers . " previous studies have suggested digital immigrants—those born before the early '80s and , as nature puts it , thought to be " doomed to be forever strangers in a computer-based strange land " —can handle technological tasks as well as the younger set . in fact , every generation has trouble multitasking ( think emailing and watching tv at the same time ) because our brains just are n't equipped to fully concentrate on multiple tasks at once . even marc prensky , the educator who first popularized the terms " digital native " and " digital immigrants " in a 2001 essay , is now moving away from those labels and embracing the term " digital wisdom , " which he says we can all aspire to . " the digital natives/digital immigrants metaphor is not about what people know , or can do , with technology , " his site notes . " it 's more about culture and attitudes . " ( not taking anything away from this 4-year-old , though . )
