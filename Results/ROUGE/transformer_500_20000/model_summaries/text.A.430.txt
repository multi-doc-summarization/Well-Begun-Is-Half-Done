a michigan man is fuming after he left his car running in a drivewayâ€”and got a ticket . " every person warms up their car , " nick taylor tells wdiv . " we live in michigan ! " taylor , 24 , left the car idling unlocked at his girlfriend 's house on a frigid morning last week . when he returned a few minutes later , he spied the $ 128 ticket for leaving a vehicle unattended . taylor posted a photo of the ticket on his facebook page and railed against the " dip -- -- " roseville police officer who left it there for " wasting the taxpayer 's money . " ( he later " retracted " the insult . ) the post has been shared nearly 14,000 times , but police chief james berlin was n't backing down , saying you ca n't leave vehicles running . " this is purely a public safety issue , " he tells fox2 . " you see it all the time , people hop in a running car and steal them . something bad happens when that occurs . " and because of the original insult , berlin says he 's not about to tear up the ticket . one footnote for those who practice taylor 's habit of warming up the car : mechanics say the old-school ritual is no longer necessary in the era of fuel-injected engines , notes usa today . in fact , today 's cars tend to warm up more quickly being driven rather than idling . ( this driver faced dui charges , though he had only caffeine in his system . )
