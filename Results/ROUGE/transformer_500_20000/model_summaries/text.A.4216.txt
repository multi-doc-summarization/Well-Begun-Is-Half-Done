rowr : after anna wintour failed to show up at giorgio armani 's autumn/winter 2014 fashion show yesterday in milan , armani did not hide his displeasure . " there are some who prefer to snub the giorgio armani show and go to paris , " he said at a press conference after the show , apparently referring to the vogue editor . " she took an airplane , dumped mr. armani and went to paris . " the problem ? armani is the only big designer whose show was on the last day of milan fashion week , so much of the press had already left for paris fashion week , which starts today , the telegraph reports . it 's not the first time wintour has skipped the armani preview for that reason , the ap notes . according to the irish independent , armani ( whose tirade also included digs at the milan fashion week organizers and other italian designers ) went on to say—while not naming wintour— " why should i always be the [ moron ] to be penalized because of a person , who , for better or for worse , like or dislike it , is powerful ? i feel penalized . she said she was sending her people . but if you go to see your dentist and he puts you in the hands of his assistant , what ’ s your reaction ? they told me , 'she went to see the privé in paris ; she has no time to see the ready-to-wear in milan . ' she is influential and powerful . but , perhaps , i ’ m influential as well . " as for wintour , her rep tells women 's wear daily , " anna has the greatest respect for giorgio armani and everything he has done for italy and fashion worldwide . unfortunately , with the fashion calendar now running for more than a month , there are some shows that anna is not able to attend .
