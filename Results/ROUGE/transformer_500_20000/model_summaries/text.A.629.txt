there 's science behind the plump dad bod : a new study that tracked the weight of 10,000 males over 20 years from adolescence into their early 30s finds the average 6-foot tall , first-time father gains 4.4 pounds if he lives with his child after birth and about 3.3 pounds if they live separately . that equals a 2.6 % and 2 % jump in a man â€™ s bmi , respectively , according to a northwestern university release . and men , do n't try to pass off the weight as a side effect of marriage . though a recent study found marriage does add a little to your waistline , the fatherhood weight gain is a separate issue " above the already known effect of marriage , " says lead author dr. craig garfield . regardless of marital status , childless men actually lost weight in the same period : about 1.4 pounds . so why are men gaining weight while chasing after little ones ? it likely comes down to a change in eating habits and lifestyle , researchers say . " you have new responsibilities when you have your kids and may not have time to take care of yourself the way you once did in terms of exercise , " garfield says . while many men quit smoking or cut back on alcohol when they have children , there may be more snacks and leftovers lying around , he tells time . " we all know dads who clean their kids ' plates after every meal . " as first-time fathers often feel they 're too young to have their own doctor , garfield suggests pediatricians strike up conversations with child-accompanying dads about their own health , since " the more weight the fathers gain and the higher their bmi , the greater risk they have for developing heart disease as well as diabetes and cancer . " ( here 's how much weight marriage packs on . )
