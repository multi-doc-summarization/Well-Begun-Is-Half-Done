a relatively new email scam is raking in millions of dollars , and it 's got nothing to do with long-lost relatives in nigeria . instead , as quartz explains , the " ceo email scam " dupes employees into wiring money by using bogus messages from the boss . the scammers do their homework : they assume the identity of a company ceo , or sometimes simply send an email so close to the correct email that the recipient never notices the difference . the requests go to someone in the company authorized to deal with money , usually demanding quick action—and confidentiality—because of a pending business deal . it 's been so successful that the fbi issued an alert last week , citing complaints in every state and in 79 countries . " on the surface , business email compromise scams may seem unsophisticated relative to moneymaking schemes that involve complex malicious software , " writes brian krebs of krebs on security . but the ceo scam is especially effective because of one crucial factor : " in traditional phishing scams , the attackers interact with the victim ’ s bank directly , but in the ceo scam the crooks trick the victim into doing that for them . " when it works , a typical haul is between $ 25,000 and $ 75,000 . the known haul worldwide is $ 2.3 billion , says the fbi . one cybersecurity expert in france warns that it wo n't go away any time soon . " it will spread because it 's too good to be ignored , " he tells the bbc .
