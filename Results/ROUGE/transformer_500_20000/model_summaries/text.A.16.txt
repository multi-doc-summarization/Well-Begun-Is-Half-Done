there are roughly 73.7 million kids running around america , and about 16 million , or nearly one in five , of them are doing so fueled by food stamps , according to us census data out yesterday . that number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels : in 2007 , some 9 million , or one in eight , kids were on food stamps . there are currently about 46 million americans total on food stamps , down from the 2013 peak of 48 million . the jump signals what reuters says is a " lop-sided " economic recovery that has left low-income people behind , but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs . as the blaze notes , republicans want to scale back the supplemental nutritional assistance program—arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need—and trimmed $ 8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year 's farm bill . democrats , meanwhile , argue that it 's too soon to scale back the program . meanwhile , some other highlights from the census numbers : 27 % of children live in single-parent homes , three times the 9 % who did in 1960 10 % of kids live with a grandparent , 15 % have a stay-at-home mom , 0.6 % have a stay-at-home dad , and 38 % have at least one foreign-born parent 48 % of households are made up of married couples , down from 76 % in 1940 americans are continuing to marry later , at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women ; that 's up from 24 and 21 in 1947
