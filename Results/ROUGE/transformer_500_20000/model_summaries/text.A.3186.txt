one of the scientists who helped unfold the structure of dna is putting his nobel prize on the auction block , and james watson says it 's because he 's broke after being ostracized by the academic community over racist remarks he made seven years ago , the atlantic reports . " no one really wants to admit i exist , " he tells the financial times , labeling himself an " unperson . " the remarks were made in a 2007 sunday times article , in which he admitted to feeling " inherently gloomy about the prospect of africa [ because ] all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as oursâ€”whereas all the testing says not really . " he tacked on that even though some would say black people were as intelligent as whites , " people who have to deal with black employees find this not true . " those were n't the first incendiary statements he 's made : as laura blue pointed out in a 2007 time article , watson has also said fat people do n't get jobs because they lack ambition , that sun and dark skin creates a " latin lover " libido , and that a female colleague widely credited with expediting the dna discovery did n't dress well . but while blue writes that it 's " hard not to feel a little bit sorry " for watson , whom she calls " less an arrogant bigot than an enthusiastic if misguided old man , " adam rutherford says in the guardian that " no one is interested in his racist , sexist views " and that " it turns out that just like dna , people are messy , complex , and sometimes full of hideous errors . " meanwhile , his nobel is expected to net between $ 2.5 million and $ 3.5 million when it 's up for auction on thursday , according to a christie 's statement . ( maybe he just needs to watch some jon stewart . )
