the white , reflective surface of greenland 's snowpack is getting darker and less reflective , all thanks to what the christian science monitor calls " positive feedback loops " —the idea that a little bit of melting leads to more and faster melting . " we knew that these processes had been happening , " says columbia professor marco tedesco , lead author of a new study in the journal cryosphere . " what ’ s new is the acceleration of the darkening , which started in 1996 . " in fact , parts of greenland may actually be 10 % darker—technically it is losing its " albedo , " or reflectivity—by the end of the century , researchers predict . " it 's a train running downhill , and the hill is getting steeper , " tedesco says . so what happened in 1996 ? one likely culprit is the natural change in atmospheric circulation called the north atlantic oscillation , in which summer atmospheric conditions " favored more incoming solar radiation and warmer , moist air from the south , " tedesco writes in columbia 's earth institute . this melting brought impurities such as soot from previous melts to the surface , making it darker and , in turn , prone to melting even faster . and because individual ice grains tend to get larger when snow melts and refreezes , less light scatters across those larger surfaces and more is absorbed , reports gizmodo . this effect appears strongest in the infrared range the human eye can not see but was found in satellite images . when the atmospheric conditions naturally shifted back in 2013 , the damage had already been done , with the ice sheet more vulnerable to melting .
