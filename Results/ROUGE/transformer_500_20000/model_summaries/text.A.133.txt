carrie underwood looked out from a louisville stage saturday night and saw a young audience member holding a sign : " carrie be my first kiss . " so the country star called chase , 12 , up on stage and offered to make his dream come trueâ€”as long as he did n't mind that her husband would be watching , the oklahoman reports . " ok , how are we going to do this ? " underwood asked . the bold tween 's reply : " lip to lip . " that 's exactly what underwood did , and later tweeted : " thanks , chase , for the kiss and thanks louisville for rocking so hard tonight ! we had fun ! # liptolip "
