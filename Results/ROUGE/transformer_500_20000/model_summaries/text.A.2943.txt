the escaped prisoner who was shot to death on friday may have been both drunk and sick when troopers finally caught up with him , reports the buffalo news . the body of richard matt reeked of booze , authorities tell the newspaper . that gibes with the report of a cabin owner who checked his place and found that somebody had gotten into his alcohol , polishing off half a bottle of gin and leaving other bottles on the table . it might have been a birthday bash : matt had turned 49 the day before he was killed . his final days clearly were n't pleasant , however . the state of his body made clear that he 'd been exposed to the elements , and—this part is a little gross—his soiled underwear suggests he 'd been sick , maybe the result of consuming bad food or water . what 's more , cnn reports that when troopers finally zeroed in on him , after a motorist reported a gun shot , it was a telltale cough that gave him away . they heard the sound in the woods , spotted matt , and ordered him to raise his hands . authorities say that while matt did n't shoot at troopers—he had a shotgun—he also failed to comply with their order , and so they opened fire . ( his escape partner david sweat remains on the run , perhaps more dangerous than ever . )
