thousands of inmates will soon be moved out of solitary confinement in california , after years of court battles and hunger strikes against the controversial practice . the state 's decision was revealed in a legal settlement filed today—which still must be accepted by the court—with a group of inmates who have been isolated at pelican bay state prison for 10 years or more , the los angeles times reports . the settlement applies to a class-action federal lawsuit covering almost 3,000 inmates , a lawsuit originally filed in 2009 by todd ashker and danny troxell , two murderers serving sentences in pelican bay . california has agreed to stop using solitary confinement as a means of controlling prison gangs ; instead , the most dangerous prisoners will be held in a group setting and will have many of the same privileges as other inmates . as the ap notes , california 's previously unlimited isolation of gang leaders had been used to keep hundreds of prisoners segregated ( often in soundproofed , windowless cells of just 80 square feet , for all but an hour and a half per day , with no access to visitors , communication , or even reading materials ) for 10 years or more . now , california will release many of the affected prisoners back into the general prison population and will limit the amount of time prisoners can spend in isolation . new " restrictive custody units " will be used for inmates who commit new crimes while in prison , refuse to participate in rehab , or who may be in danger from other inmates , but those units will allow prisoners more personal contact and other privileges . the union that represents most prison guards has expressed safety concerns , with the spokesperson noting that the state could " return to the prison environment of the '70s and '80s , when inmate-on-inmate homicides were at the highest levels and staff were killed .
