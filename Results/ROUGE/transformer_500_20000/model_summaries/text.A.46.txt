if you live in america , there ’ s a good chance you ’ re shoveling snow today—or will be soon—but beware : the dreaded chore can actually kill you . how to avoid such a tragic fate ? well , for starters , keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less . beyond that , however , the recommendations get muddled , notes timothy noah on slate : shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow , and vice versa . there is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job , but good luck finding one in a hardware store . a few other things will lessen your risk : don ’ t start shoveling while snow is still falling ( it ’ s colder , so you ’ ll put additional strain on your heart ) ; don ’ t bundle up too much ( getting too hot isn ’ t good , either ) ; and don ’ t drink coffee ( it increases your heart rate ) or hot cocoa ( who knows why ? ) right before shoveling . if that all sounds like too much trouble , “ wait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $ 20 or $ 30 , ” noah recommends . “ delegate . the economy will benefit and your cardiologist will thank you . ”
