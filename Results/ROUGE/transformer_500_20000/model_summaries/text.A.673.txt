cnn aired a documentary about campus rape sunday night—and this one came with the threat of a lawsuit ahead of time . the network ran the hunting ground , a documentary first seen at the sundance film festival , reports npr . the most controversial part includes an interview with erica kinsman , who accuses football star jameis winston of sexually assaulting her while at florida state . winston , a heisman winner who is now a quarterback for the tampa bay buccaneers , never faced criminal rape charges , and the school cleared him of misconduct , notes the new york times . kinsman is suing winston , however , and winston 's lawyers now may do the same to cnn , reports the hollywood reporter . " we are writing to formally caution cnn that the portions of the film 'the hunting ground ' pertaining to mr. winston are false and defamatory to mr. winston , " says a letter to cnn obtained by the site ahead of sunday 's airing . but cnn shot back in a statement that it is " proud to provide a platform for a film that has undeniably played a significant role in advancing the national conversation about sexual assault on college campuses . " winston 's legal team says the film “ manipulates , misstates or simply omits facts to present a false narrative , " but filmmakers kirby dick and amy ziering say " the truth is on our side . "
