after months of painstaking work in the sands of california , archaeologists have managed to restore a sphinx and other relics from a lost age—1920s hollywood . the sphinx , one of 21 used in cecil b. demille 's 1923 movie the ten commandments , has been restored after it was excavated from california 's guadalupe-nipomo dunes . demille left an enormous set buried there , but what the san luis obispo tribune calls the " lost city of demille " started to be uncovered as sands shifted in the 1990s . the relic goes on display at a nearby cultural center today , and livescience notes that in humid conditions , working with the plaster sphinx archaeologists call nora was n't easy and she 's not quite as good as new : there 's a bullet hole in her stomach , as well as graffiti reading " may 1930 , " and her head—along with the rest of her top half—is still in the sands . guadalupe-nipomo dunes center executive director doug jenzen tells the tribune that after the first sphinx they tried to remove crumbled , they spotted what looked like a " giant white buffalo wing " sticking out of the sand and found nora . he notes that other artifacts on display , including tobacco tins and " cough syrup " bottles that probably held bootleg liquor , show that a lot of people had a " pretty good time " making the silent film . also on display : a blackened piece of toast from the film camp . " it 's definitely not edible anymore , " jenzen says . the 10.5-foot-long sphinx body , the toast , and a sphinx head found during a previous excavation will be unveiled at a 1920s-themed party tonight , reports the lompoc record . ( relics from a much earlier age were torched during a burning man festival in israel . )
