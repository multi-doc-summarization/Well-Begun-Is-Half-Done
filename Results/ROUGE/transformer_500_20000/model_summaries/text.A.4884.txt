snowfall in siberia during october has proved to be a remarkably accurate indication of how cold winters in the us will be , according to meteorologist judah cohenâ€”and it looks like this winter could be a doozy . siberia experienced record snowfall and its worst blizzard in 10 years this october , meaning the " arctic oscillation " pattern could once again cause the polar vortex to put the us ' northeast in a deep freeze , reports usa today . but cohen , an atmospheric and environmental research scientist who describes himself as a " weather weenie , " says the very strong el nino pattern has made this year more complicated than most and for now , he predicts mild weather in the short term . " the snow cover is the most efficient reflector of sunlight out into space , so more snow cover creates dense air masses that stay close to the ground , " cohen told the boston globe earlier this year while explaining why such an immense amount of snow had fallen on the city , and how siberian snow predicted it . university of albany polar vortex expert andrea lang tells the albany times union that while mild weather may lie ahead until around christmas this year , the vortex is currently stronger than usual , which raises the risk of it becoming weaker than usual later in the season , sending fiercely cold weather south . ( the old farmer 's almanac says the coming winter will be incredibly cold , while the noaa believes it could be balmier than usual in a lot of places . )
