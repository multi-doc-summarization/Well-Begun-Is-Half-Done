" the reasons for this action are self-evident : the continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere , including against law enforcement and other government officials , and the acts of violence targeted at government personnel and installations in canada and elsewhere recently , " dhs secretary jeh johnson said in a statement . the chairman of the house committee on homeland security hailed the move , while johnson urged state and local security officials to also prepare for " potential small-scale attacks by a lone offender or a small group of individuals , " usa today reports .
