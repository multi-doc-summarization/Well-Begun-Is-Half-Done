people already outraged about stanford rapist brock turner 's six-month jail sentence are n't going to like this next piece of news : he 'll likely go free after only three months . the ap reports turner , convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman during a frat party last january , was booked at the santa clara county jail on june 2 and is scheduled for release on sept. 2 . as a rule , county jail inmates only serve half their sentences as long as they behave . prosecutors had asked for the 20-year-old swimmer to serve six years in prison . during his three months in jail , turner will be under protective custody to keep him safe from his fellow inmates , who frequently target those convicted of sex crimes , according to the huffington post . meanwhile , turner 's father , friends , relatives—and even turner himself—continue to deflect blame for his crime .
