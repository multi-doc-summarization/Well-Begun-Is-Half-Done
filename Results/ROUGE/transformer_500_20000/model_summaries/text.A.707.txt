arizona 's new law banning abortions beginning at what the state defines as 20 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional , a us district judge has ruled , setting the stage for the law to go into effect this week . the new law may force some pregnant women to opt for an abortion earlier , but the measure is constitutional because it does n't ban abortions outright , determined judge james teilborg . he also said the state provided " substantial and well-documented " evidence that a fetus can feel pain by at least 20 weeks gestation , reports ap . the ban is set to go into effect for all women except in cases of medical emergencies on thursday . the new york-based center for reproductive rights has filed a notice that it plans to appeal the decision to the 9th us circuit court of appeals , but it 's not clear if that will hold up the law . the law will complicate " fetal defect " cases in which a number of babies with fatal problems must now be carried to term but will likely die in minutes or days after birth , reports the arizona republic . the new law forbids doctors from aborting most fetuses with a gestational age of 20 weeks or older , even in situations where the doctor discovers the fetus has such a defect . but the law defines gestational age as beginning with the first day of a woman 's last period , which means most fetuses will typically have an actual gestational age of 18 weeks when abortions can no longer be performed . that 's about the time ultrasound tests are conducted to detect abnormalities , notes the republic .
