a tree beloved by anne frank is gone , toppled by a storm today in amsterdam . the chestnut tree stood outside the window of the attic where frank hid , and she often wrote about it in her diaries . in the years since her death , the 150-year-old “ anne frank tree ” became rotted and diseased ; city officials ordered it felled , but a 2007 campaign managed to save it . its trunk was encased in a steep support system , but even that failed to protect it from today ’ s strong winds , the ap reports . no one was hurt , and the nearby anne frank house museum was unharmed . the tree lives on through more than 160 clones planted in amsterdam and the us . “ from my favorite spot on the floor i look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree , on whose branches little raindrops shine , appearing like silver , and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind , ” frank wrote in 1944 . pieces of the tree are now for sale on a dutch auction site , reuters adds .
