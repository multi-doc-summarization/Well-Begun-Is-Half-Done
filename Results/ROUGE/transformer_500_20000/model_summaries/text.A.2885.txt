the official government death toll in puerto rico from devastating hurricane maria stands at 64 . a new assessment led by harvard researchers puts the figure closer to 5,000 , reports npr . more specifically , the researchers calculate that puerto rico had 4,645 " excess deaths " between sept. 20 , 2017 , and dec. 31 , they write in the new england journal of medicine . how they got the figure : researchers surveyed 3,299 homes in january and february and turned up 38 deaths in the time period after the hurricane , then extrapolated the figure to the island 's population of 3.4 million . they concluded with a 95 % certainty that the death toll attributable to the hurricane is between 800 and 8,500 , with the figure of 4,645 a likely estimate . they also found that when comparing the number of deaths to 2016 , the island 's mortality rate increased 62 % in the three months following the storm . " our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after hurricane maria , " the authors write . the toll of 64 mostly counts people killed directly by rising water or wind , and the washington post provides an example of a death that went uncounted . ivette leon , 54 , died at home in november , less than a day after being released from the hospital . as her condition deteriorated , it took family members 20 minutes to get cell reception to summon help , and then nonworking traffic lights delayed the arrival of an ambulance . the new study suggests there are thousands more like her . " that is an astonishing undercount , " a columbia professor who was n't involved with the study tells buzzfeed news . " something has gone terribly wrong here if they have a 70-times-higher death rate . "
