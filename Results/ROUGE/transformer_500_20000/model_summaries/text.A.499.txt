egyptian president mohamed morsi returned to the presidential palace today after fleeing yesterday when it was thronged by protesters , reuters reports . though 200 demonstrators camped out overnight , traffic was back to normal today and riot police had left the area . in yesterday 's clashes , 35 protesters and 40 police officers were hurt . and things are looking to heat up again soon : the muslim brotherhood has called for a protest at the palace today against the " oppressive abuses " of the opposition , and the opposition in response called for leftist demonstrators to head back to the palace , leading to fears of violent clashes . opposition protesters want morsi to retract his expanded powers and stop a dec. 15 vote on the new constitution hastily drafted by islamists . though they called yesterday 's protest a " last warning " to the president , reuters notes that they have little real chance of stopping the vote , which morsi is confident will approve the constitution .
