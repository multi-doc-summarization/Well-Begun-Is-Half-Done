consider these two numbers : 5.57 inches and 6.69 . the first is the average erect penile length , according to a study of 1,661 american men . the latter is the minimum length that standard condoms have been required to be . if that seems like a disconnect , well , it is , and change is coming—though not without some difficulty . in a look at the condom industry , the new york times explains that revolution is challenging in large part because of the food and drug administration . it classifies condoms as medical devices , which means any new product has to go through pricey clinical trials to gain approval . case in point : the gates foundation gave mark mcglothlin $ 100,000 to pursue his idea of making condoms from things like cow tendon , but he 's far short of the $ 2 million he says the trials would cost . and the makeup of the tests themselves have been problematic . one is called the " hang-and-squeeze , " and it 's much like it sounds like : a condom is filled with water and then squeezed to look for leakage . but make a condom for the 5.57-inch—or less—man , and filling it with the required water volume does n't work . the fda and two standards organizations have started to acknowledge the limitations and tweak the requirements and tests , and that 's opened the door for boston-based global protection corp. to begin selling condoms that come in 60 sizes . per a press release , 28 of those sizes are larger than the length , width , or both of the " leading xl condom , " while 27 are smaller than the typical one . ( this study found a slightly different average penile length . )
