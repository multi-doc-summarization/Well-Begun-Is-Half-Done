donald trump has announced that he will nominate attorney david friedman as us ambassador to israel , selecting an envoy who supports israeli settlements and other changes to us policies in the region , reports the ap . friedman says he looks forward to carrying out his duties from " the us embassy in israel 's eternal capital , jerusalem , " even though the embassy is in tel aviv . like some of his predecessors , trump has vowed to move the american embassy to jerusalem , a politically charged act that would anger palestinians who want east jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory . the move would also distance the us from most of the international community , including its closest allies in western europe and the arab world . the president-elect says friedman will " maintain the special relationship " between the us and israel . but the announcement sparked anger from liberal jewish groups , with the president of j street calling friedman 's nomination " reckless , " citing his support for settlements and his questioning of a two-state solution with the palestinians . ( friedman has previously likened liberal jews in the us to jews who aided the nazis during world war ii , notes the new york times . ) the statement does n't detail how friedman could work in jerusalem . one option would involve friedman , if confirmed by the senate , working out of an existing us consulate in jerusalem . the administration would essentially deem the facility the american embassy by virtue of the ambassador working there .
