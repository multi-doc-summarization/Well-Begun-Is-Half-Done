puppy lovers , rejoice . officials in eastern china last week canceled the jinhua hutou dog meat festival . if that name makes you a little queasyâ€”well , there 's good reason for that . the 600-year-old tradition saw at least 5,000 of dogs slaughtered on the spot , and served up as the main dish . as the story goes , the festival stemmed from a tradition begun in the 14th century , when the barking dogs that revealed an army 's position were fed to the soldiers on the general 's angry orders , reports the new york times . the ancient custom was scuttled following a web campaign staged by animal-rights advocates , who posted graphic images from past festivals of cooked dogs and leftover carcasses . the people 's daily shares the observations of one blogger , " i 've seen the dogs being stabbed , strangled , and even beaten into comas and thrown into boiling water . " some say it 's an encouraging sign that , as pet ownership gains steam in china , so too does the animal-rights movement . but not everyone is on board . wrote another blogger , " i personally think dog meat is like alcohol . they are both components of our ancient chinese culture .
