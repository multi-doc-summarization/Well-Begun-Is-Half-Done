buzzfeed has identified anthony weiner 's newly revealed sexting partner as sydney elaine leathers , a progressive activist in her early 20s who lives in indiana . pictures on her facebook and formspring accounts look pretty close to the blurred images offered up on the dirty when it broke the sexting story , and she 's talked about weiner quite a bit online ( often on accounts that are now deleted ) . for example , in a june 2011 facebook post , she declared : " rep. weiner can continue sending dick pics every single day for the rest of his life as long as he continues to legislate like he does . i decided . " her twitpic account identifies her as an obama for america field organizer . she also listed weiner as one of her heroes , wrote at least one blog post about his resignation , and said on facebook that he should n't have resigned . an anonymous source confirms buzzfeed got the id right and says he or she saw the messages exchanged a year ago , but a buzzfeed reporter asked weiner last night if he knew leathers and—shocker—got no response . the source , who says he or she has known leathers since high school , says she " felt she was the important one " to weiner , even more important than wife huma abedin . as for abedin , daily intel notes that she came to a " prescient conclusion " in september 's harper 's bazaar : " people have said many things about my husband—some nice , some not so nice . and that will surely continue . launching this campaign was not an easy decision for our family to make . putting yourself out there comes with a cost . " ( meanwhile , " cubicle guy " has become a viral sensation after weiner 's press conference last night . )
