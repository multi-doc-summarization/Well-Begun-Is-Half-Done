uber looks like it 's trying to get in on the self-driving cars business , officially announcing this week that it 's partnering with carnegie mellon university ( home to the mars rover ) to build the uber advanced technologies center in pittsburgh—in other words , " kickstart autonomous taxi fleet development , " inside sources tell techcrunch . and while uber would n't say as much , sources allege that the company is hiring more than 50 senior scientists from the university , as well as an affiliated robotics research center ; uber does say the partnership will focus on " mapping and vehicle safety and autonomy technology . " it 's not the first time uber ceo travis kalanick has talked about turning real drivers into robotic ones . meanwhile google , which grist reports has thus far played nice with uber by sharing google maps and investing $ 258 million in its app , might be ending that streak . google appears to be creating its own ride-hailing app , reports bloomberg business , and is already well ahead of uber when it comes to autonomous vehicles . curiously , david drummond , google 's chief legal officer , is so far still maintaining a spot on uber ’ s board , even though the two companies appear to be on the verge of becoming competitors . ( uber 's legal troubles continue to mount around the world . )
