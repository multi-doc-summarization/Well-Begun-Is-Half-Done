scientists are urging people to watch what they eat—and drink—in a new study linking a pesticide with parkinson 's disease . researchers note that , for a time , cattle in hawaii were likely fed a gruel containing traces of heptachlor , used by american pineapple farmers before it was banned in 1988 , per time . the cows ' milk was contaminated , but " no one knows how long or how widespread the contamination was before being detected , " the parkinson 's disease foundation says , per nbc news . to test the possible effects , researchers studied the brains of 116 japanese-american men in hawaii who had given information about their milk-drinking habits before they died . they found men who consumed more than two glasses of milk , or 16 ounces , daily had 40 % fewer brain cells in the substantia nigra , an area that shows damage in parkinson 's cases , compared to men who drank less than two cups per day . some 90 % of heavy milk drinkers also had heptachlor residue in their brains , compared to 63 % of those who did n't drink milk . researchers dated the cell damage to after the accumulation of heptachlor , which suggests the chemical was responsible for the changes . the team could n't test milk samples , but they " have no other explanation for how heptachlor epoxide found its way into the brains of men who consumed milk , " a study author tells live science . he notes " the vast majority of milk consumers do not get parkinson 's disease , " but " this adds to the literature that diet may indeed play a role . " the study also backs others suggesting smokers enjoy protection against parkinson 's : milk drinkers who smoked showed no brain cell loss . one critic notes participants divulged how much milk they drank some 30 years before they died , so their consumption perhaps changed . ( this pesticide has been linked to alzheimer 's . )
