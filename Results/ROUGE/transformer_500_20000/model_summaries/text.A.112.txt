hillary clinton paid the obligatory visit to the iowa state fair today , and politico sounds impressed that she could be seen " embracing the masses that engulfed her . " it 's a contrast to campaign events in the past , including her team 's now-infamous use of a moving rope line last month to protect the candidate . it 's also a notable departure from her appearance in iowa in 2008 , when she did n't want to mingle with the commonfolk , writes rachel bade . clinton also made headlines this weekend for joking about her email controversy , notes nbc news . " you may have seen that i recently launched a snapchat account , " she said at a dinner last night . " i love it . i love it . those messages disappear all by themselves . " today , reporters grilled her anew about the controversy , including whether her joke suggested she was taking it too lightly . " we 'll see how this all plays out , but it 's not something the people raise with me as i travel around the country , " said clinton , again reiterating that she never sent or received email marked as classified . the " marked as classified " is an important distinction : it turns out that some emails were indeed considered top secret , though it 's unclear whether that designation came about after the emails were sent or whether state department officials were careless . to help figure it out , the fbi will try to gain access to the accounts of state department officials who were there during clinton 's tenure , reports the new york times .
