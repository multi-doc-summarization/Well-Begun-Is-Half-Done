the good news is that scientists now think they know why so many dead dolphins are washing up on shores along the east coast—it 's a virus akin to measles , reports wired . the bad news is that they ca n't do anything but let it run its course . so far , about 330 dolphins have washed up , mostly in virginia , a figure 10 times higher than normal . ( and , of course , hundreds , perhaps thousands , more likely never reached shore . ) a similar outbreak of this morbillivirus in 1987-88 caused 800 dead dolphins to wash ashore , and if the new outbreak follows the same pattern , the virus will probably remain in play until next spring . it 's expected to move south along the atlantic seaboard . “ at this point , there isn ’ t anything we can do to stop the virus , ” says an official with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . " we don ’ t have a vaccine that is developed that could be easily deployed in a wild population of bottlenose dolphins. ” the dolphins probably lost their immunity since the last outbreak , a vet tells nbc news . it 's not clear how the outbreak started , but scientists figure the coastal dolphins picked up the virus from some other marine mammal . it 's all but impossible this strain could spread to humans , notes abc news .
