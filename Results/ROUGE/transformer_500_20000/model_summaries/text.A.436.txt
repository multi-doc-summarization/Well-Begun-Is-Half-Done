if richard spencer wants to try to stir up any trouble in charlottesville , he 's going to have to do it anywhere other than the university of virginia , at least for the next four years . that 's because , per the washington post , the uva grad and noted white nationalist has been banned from campus , along with nine others , after they took part in a march of white supremacists on school grounds in august 2017â€”a weekend that culminated in violence and the death of counterprotester heather heyer . " the trespass warnings issued today reflect our commitment to ensuring the safety of our community while upholding the principles of freedom of speech and assembly , " uva president jim ryan said in a statement . the ban came down after a yearlong probe by university police , as well as state and federal law-enforcement agencies , into the 2017 rally and those involved . if spencer or any of the other men banned from campus violate the order , they 'll be slapped with a misdemeanor charge of criminal trespassing , cnn notes . " we have drawn a distinction between free speech and conduct that is aimed to intimidate others and promote violence , " says tommye sutton , the head of campus police . " such conduct and intimidation will not be tolerated . " spencer 's written response to the post : " ideas have no jurisdiction and ultimately ca n't be censored . that said , i have no immediate plans to engage in activism on campus , at uva or anywhere . " ( maybe that 's because he 's got to deal with his marital and domestic violence problems . )
