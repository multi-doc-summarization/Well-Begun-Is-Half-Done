alaska couple kelly tousley and curtiss o'rorke stedman , both 27 , vowed at the end of 2014 that they would quit their jobs as a social services worker and english teacher and spend a year traveling the us . " after four years of being 'professional adults , ' we realized we wanted more out of life , " they write on their blog , pay gas , not rent . to afford the dream , they sold almost every possession in their more than 1,000-square-foot rental home and spent about $ 10,000 turning a 98-square-foot trailer into a livable space , complete with toilet , mini fridge , sink , desk , pullout bed , and lots of hooks for storage . they left on may 31 , 2015 , traveling from alaska to michigan and from there to at least 13 more states so far . and business insider reports that seven months into their journey the couple is not only surviving but enjoying themselvesâ€”and is entirely debt-free . not every month is equal . their expenses were low when they spent a good chunk of the fall with family in colorado , for instance , but they spent thousands getting to and exploring california . stedman , a musician who goes by the name " cousin curtiss , " plays two to four gigs a week to support their adventure , and the couple says it helps that they have no space to put new material possessions . stedman admits that they had to learn as they built their new home , which had to hold their two dogs as well : before this adventure , " the coolest thing that i built to date was a birdhouse in sixth grade , " he told alaska public radio at the start of their journey . much of what they learned was through youtube and trial and error , the grand valley magazine reports . but while they admit to business insider that they 're committed to finding real jobs again when the year is up and saving for things like retirement , they 'll never stop traveling . ( the tiny house movement has a little secret . )
