repeal of do n't ask , do n't tell will get another chance . republican susan collins and independent joe lieberman say they plan to introduce a stand-alone measure in the lame-duck session , and harry reid says he 's on board , reports msnbc . it 's no gim me by any stretch—opponents could try to talk it to death with amendments , for one thing , notes the times—but " we 're not going to give up , " says lieberman . assuming it comes up after the tax issue is settled , it could theoretically pick up three decisive pro-repeal votes from scott brown , lisa murkowski , and dick lugar , writes greg sargent at his plum line blog . the measure that failed today ( by three votes ) was part of a larger defense bill , and harry reid knew it was going to fail when he brought it up for vote , writes sargent . so why did he do it ? he figured it was doomed anyway—that even if he had agreed to collins ' demands for four days of debate , others would n't abide by that deal . " you can talk about four days until the cows come home , " an aide tells sargent . " that has very little meaning for coburn and demint and others who have become very skilled at grinding this place to a halt . "
