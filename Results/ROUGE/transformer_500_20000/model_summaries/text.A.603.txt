a major idaho potato producer has won some love from the fda for its genetically modified spud , but do n't look for the " innate " potato in the deep fryers at mcdonald 's anytime soon . as the idaho statesman reports , the fast-food giant—a longtime major buyer of boise-based jr simplot co.—is taking a pass . " mcdonald 's usa does not source gmo potatoes , nor do we have current plans to change our sourcing practices , " it says in a statement . the innate potato , which got the fda ok earlier this month to begin planting commercially , contains fewer sugars and asparagine—which can convert to acrylamide , a carcinogen—than normal potatoes ; it also bruises less easily , notes the ap . it 's not the first time a gmo spud hit the fast-food industry with a thud , notes the statesman ; monsanto suffered a similar fate a decade ago with a bug-resistant potato it ultimately yanked over lack of demand . meanwhile , food & water watch calls the move a " major victory for consumers , " with director wenonah hauter adding that " while we can not speak to the rest of mcdonald 's practices , this decision marks a milestone in the movement to protect consumers from the potential dangers of gmo foods . " hauter urges mickey dee 's competitors to likewise snub the innate potato .
