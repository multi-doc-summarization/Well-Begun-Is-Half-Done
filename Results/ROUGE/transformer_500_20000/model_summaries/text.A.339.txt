a yelp employee who complained about having to live in near-poverty conditions has a new problem—she needs a job . talia jane wrote an open letter to ceo jeremy stoppelman on friday seeking higher compensation and detailing her struggles to afford food , rent , and transportation in san francisco , and got fired hours later , re/code reports . " my manager and hr told me the letter and what i wrote violated yelp ’ s terms of conduct , " she tells buzzfeed . stoppelman tweeted that he was n't involved in her firing and " it was not because she posted a ... letter directed at me . " either way , the letter has drawn attention for its depiction of life with an entry-level customer-support position at eat24 , yelp 's food delivery service , in one of america 's most expensive cities . seems jane lived mostly on rice and water , slept fully clothed because she could n't afford heat , and put 80 % of her bi-weekly $ 733.24 check toward rent . ( she netted $ 8.15 an hour . ) " so here i am , 25 years old , balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn ’ t involve crying in the bathtub every week , " she writes in the 2,392-word letter . " every single one of my coworkers is struggling . they ’ re taking side jobs , they ’ re living at home . " so did yelp overreact ? a forbes blogger says the letter has " a condescending tone replete with a smug , accusatory naïveté , " and a reddit user accuses jane of posting " unprofessional " tweets before the letter . but stoppelman concedes jane 's point that " the cost of living in sf is far too high " and proposes expanding eat 24 's operations in phoenix as a solution . jane , who is accepting donations , does n't seem impressed : " yelp is trying to make this die down by lying about it , " she says . " things have just exploded . " ( a san francisco " tech bro " called for the city to deal with homeless " riff raff . " )
