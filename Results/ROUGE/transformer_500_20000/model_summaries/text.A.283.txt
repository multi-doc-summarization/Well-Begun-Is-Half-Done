it seems almost everyone dislikes nickelback , but one london man apparently hates them more than most : craig mandell launched a crowdfunding campaign with the sole aim of keeping the canadian band out of his city , time reports . " do n't let nickel back , " which is being funded on the kickstarter-like platform tilt , has a goal of $ 1,000 . for every $ 1 received , mandell will email nickelback 's management on the donor 's behalf " kindly requesting that they do not play in london , england , for the foreseeable future . " for $ 5 , you get a " slightly more forceful email " sent on your behalf ; for $ 10 , an email " full of explicit phrases and lots of capital letters and maybe even a rude emoticon or two . " but the pièce de résistance : for a $ 50 contribution , mandell will send an email to nickelback ... with an mp3 of the band 's own music attached . " this way , the band will hear their own music , and likely retire immediately , " he writes . mandell was inspired by a recent crowdfunding campaign that convinced the foo fighters to play a previously nonexistent show—something he does not want to see happen with nickelback . mandell is actually friends with the organizer of that campaign , nme reports . as for the money he raises ( he 's currently only at $ 189 ) , mandell says he 's not in the market for " personal profit " and will donate it to charity— " or perhaps therapy for those who 've been affected by the band . " ( could u2 be heading for nickelback 's fate ? )
