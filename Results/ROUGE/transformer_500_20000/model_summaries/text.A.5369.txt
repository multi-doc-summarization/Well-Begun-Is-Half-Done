authorities have rounded up hundreds of relatives of kim jong un 's recently executed uncle and ferried them to prison camps , according to a report out of seoul . the night after jang song thaek was executed , " armed men from the ministry of state security arrived unannounced in the pyongchon area of pyongyang where a lot of his relatives lived , " an insider tells the daily nk , which is run by defectors , fox news notes . " it was not just his close relatives who were taken away , but distant members of his family , too . " observers say family members could be executed or spend life in prison ( though things appear ok for kim 's aunt ) . in other news from pyongyang : the telegraph lists some of the 24 charges against jang , which apparently included " gnawing at the unity and cohesion of the party " and " dreaming different dreams . " he was also blamed for " improper relations with several women " and " squandering foreign currency at casinos . " but pyongyang 's claims that jang was executed over his plans to seize power are likely inaccurate , says south korea 's head of intelligence : the real problem was jang and his associates ' push to take control of major business dealsâ€”for instance , coal sales to china , the official said in a closed meeting , as noted by the new york times . after jang 's rivals complained , kim ordered jang 's associates to drop certain deals , but they refused ; kim believed his authority was being questioned . in less consequential north korea news , dennis rodman has exited the country , having wrapped up his third " fun " visit . he did n't get to see his pal kim this time around ( he was training basketball players ) , but tells cnn , " i 'm not worried about it . i 'll see him again . i will be coming back in another week .
