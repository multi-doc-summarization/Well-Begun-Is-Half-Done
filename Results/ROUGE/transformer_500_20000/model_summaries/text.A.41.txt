a pennsylvania middle school teacher is in hot water over his spelling of " hillary clinton , " and no , benjamin attinger did n't forget an " l. " the daily item reports the shikellamy middle school teacher was asked by 6th-grade student mary reinard for help in sending a letter to clinton . mary wrote the letter , in which she reportedly asked clinton if she really spoke to the dead ( a 1996 book said she had imaginary chats with eleanor roosevelt and gandhi , but not jesus , as a " therapeutic release , " per a cnn article published at the time ) . she and attinger put it in an envelope bearing the school 's return address , and attinger addressed it : to " hiliar rodham clinton . " mary brought the letter home to stamp and mail , and stepmom shannon reinard spotted the " liar " in the name and called the school on friday . in a voicemail attinger left the sunbury mom , he apologized and claimed it was a " kind of a joke ... because i was telling her it ( talking to the dead ) was n't true . " the family met with attinger and administrators on tuesday and say they 've accepted his apology and do n't want him fired . mary says she 's relieved she did n't mail the letter as it was ; she had n't spotted the typo . " i would have felt embarrassed . i would n't have been able to go to school for a week . " now , instead of embarrassed , she 's " nervi-cided . " that 's nervous and excited , because after chelsea clinton on wednesday tweeted she 'd be happy to hand-deliver the letter to her mom , she was connected with shannon reinard on twitter and told her they 'd be on the lookout for the letter , which had been properly mailed . " please thank mary for her courage , " chelsea clinton wrote , per the meadville tribune .
