one person we have n't heard from in decades " as controversies tumbled around her " : soon-yi previn , wife of woody allen and adopted daughter of mia farrow . " no more , " writes daphne merkin in a piece in new york that 's attracting plenty of attentionâ€”and backlash . previn details her life , from the time she says she was a 5-year-old runaway in south korea , up through her adoption by farrow and headline-making relationship with allen , who 'd been in a long-term relationship with farrow . " he pursued me , " previn says , revealing she " hated him " at first . " that 's why the relationship has worked . ... he 's usually a meek person , and he took a big leap . " much of the piece , however , focuses on previn 's thoughts on farrow and sibling dylan farrow , who has stood by her accusations that adoptive father allen molested her when she was a child . " what 's happened to woody is so upsetting , so unjust , " previn tells merkin , saying mia farrow was an abusive , neglectful mother who " has taken advantage of the # metoo movement and paraded dylan as a victim . " a good deal of outrage about the interview is driven by merkin 's 40-year friendship with allen , notes the hollywood reporter . dylan farrow put out a statement saying merkin 's story was full of " bizarre fabrications . " " the idea of letting a friend of an alleged predator write a one-sided piece attacking the credibility of his victim is disgusting , " she notes . she also posted a statement from seven of her siblings in support of their mom , as well as one from brother ronan farrow , who 's been instrumental in advancing the " me too " movement with his exposes . new york has " done something shameful here , " he writes , calling the piece a " hit job . " full interview with previn here .
