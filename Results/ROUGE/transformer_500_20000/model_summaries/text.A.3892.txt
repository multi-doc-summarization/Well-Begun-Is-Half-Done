howard arthur klein lived 87 years without so much as a blot on his criminal record . in truth , the elderly michigan man did n't have a record at all until a night in june when he was nabbed in a sting , accused of soliciting a prostitute who was actually an undercover cop . but it seems all will be forgotten as a kent county prosecutor has decided to throw out his case . " he is 87 years old with absolutely no criminal record . in addition , i am told he struggles to some degree with dementia , " he tells michigan live . " he would n't and should n't go to jail and 87 years without involvement in the criminal justice system has , in my opinion , earned him a pass . " two accused prostitutes , aged 32 and 45 , and two other males arrested alongside klein in the june sting in grand rapids were booked into the kent county jail , but klein was allowed to go free because of his age , reports fox 17 . he was arraigned on july 8 and faced 93 days in jail if convicted . klein , who mlive reports is " likely the oldest person ever charged with this crime , " has denied any wrongdoing . he tells wood-tv he simply thought the woman he approached on a street was someone he knew from his church .
