a judge on tuesday allowed a man charged in freeway shootings that rattled phoenix last year to be released from jail amid questions about evidence authorities say links him to the crimes . the judge overseeing the case of leslie merritt jr. reduced his bond to zero and said he can return to his home under electronic monitoring , the ap reports . he was expected to be released later in the day . the reduction of the bond—once $ 1 million—was a major victory as defense lawyers contend that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that merritt was behind four of the freeway shootings . " with all due respect your honor , there 's no evidence against him to show he 's responsible for this , " defense lawyer jason lamm said . " he is no more the i-10 shooter than , respectfully , you are . " merritt lifted up his shackled arms in celebration as he walked from the courtroom . after the hearing , family members hugged and shook the hands of defense lawyers . merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting , aggravated assault , and other charges . the shootings caused panic on phoenix-area freeways , where 11 vehicles were hit in august and september . detectives took merritt into custody on sept. 18 ; in court the next day , merritt adamantly denied shooting any cars , telling the judge , " i 'm the wrong guy . " his lawyers immediately began raising questions about the evidence , citing ballistics information and phone records they say provided an alibi for their client . ( also tuesday , a motorist suspected of shooting at other vehicles on an alabama highway died after a shootout with officers . )
