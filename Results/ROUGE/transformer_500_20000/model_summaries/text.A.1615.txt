there 's another gop debate on tuesday , and the stage will feature fewer candidatesâ€”though not because anyone has dropped out . host fox business on thursday announced the lineup , and chris christie and mike huckabee have been relegated to the early debate . the criteria the decision was based on : a minimum polling average of 2.5 % in four recent polls . the hill reports the two finished at 2.25 % , with rand paul barely making it in at the 2.5 % cutoff . seven will be joining paul in milwaukee , per nbc news : donald trump , ben carson , marco rubio , carly fiorina , ted cruz , jeb bush , and john kasich . the early debate will also feature bobby jindal and rick santorum ; lindsey graham and george pataki did n't make the cut , having failed to grab at least 1 % in any of the four polls .
