egypt 's muslim brotherhood promises not to run a candidate for president in the fall elections , but it made clear today it wants a voice in the new egypt by announcing plans to form a political party , reports cnn . that 's certain to get a charge out of the brotherhood 's worst critics in the west , who fear the rise of a virulent anti-american islamist party . but as the wall street journal explains , the same kind of youth movement that upended the old guard of the ruling party might have the same kind of effect within the brotherhood . it contrasts two members of the group , one a 29-year-old pro-democracy activist named moaz abdel karim who worked with other opposition leaders to coordinate the tahrir square protests . his focus is on human rights , not jihad . the other is a 66-year-old brotherhood leader from the group 's conservative wing named mohammed badi who rails against israel and american imperialism . the once-banned brotherhood is destined to play a sizable role in the nation 's future . " the question for many , " writes charles levinson , " is which brotherhood ? "
