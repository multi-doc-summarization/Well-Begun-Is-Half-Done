firefighters at disney world were warned to stop feeding alligators two months before a gator killed 2-year-old lane graves , according to employee emails . emails from employees of reedy creek emergency services—which operates inside the park—show firefighters had been feeding at least one of two gators apparently living in a pond near their fire station , less than a mile from where lane was killed , reports the orlando sentinel . one alligator was believed to be four or five feet long , and the other was a juvenile . in one email to the fire station 's commanders , a communications rep said an alligator had been spotted near the station where communications staff parked their cars , and some " expressed concern of becoming alligator food . ... ( c ) ould you ask your crews to stop feeding the gator . " a reedy creek dispatcher later complained about two gators in the parking lot . " they are not docile gators , they are mean and they are out looking for food because people are feeding them , " he wrote . " it 's getting uncomfortable . " a reedy creek district administrator says firefighters received " just a talking to " —though feeding gators is illegal in florida . it 's not clear whether these gators have any connection to lane 's death . the administrator is skeptical because they would have had " to travel across a couple roadways " to get to the seven seas lagoon near the grand floridian resort & spa , where the june 14 incident took place . still , notes the washington post , trying to avoid such attacks is " one reason it is illegal to feed alligators in florida . " the resort area has since added signs warning people about feeding them , reports people . ( the june attack was the result of a " perfect storm " of circumstances . )
