in stark contrast to earlier evictions , dozens of jewish settlers ordered to leave their homes in the west bank yesterday did so peacefully . israel is in the process of evacuating the ulpana outpost on the orders of its supreme court , which determined that five apartment blocks had been illegally built on private palestinian land , reports the washington post . the ulpana settlers , who were moved to prefabricated homes on a nearby military outpost , said a prominent rabbi had advised them to avoid confrontation with the military . " this is not a happy day for israel , " one departing resident said . " to leave a house is very simple , but to leave a home is very difficult . " several other evictions based on similar court orders are expected to take place over the next few weeks . prime minister benjamin netanyahu responded to the court order by vowing to build 850 new apartments in the west bank to replace the 30 emptied units . he has also promised to uproot the five apartment blocks from their foundations and move them to another location , although engineers say doing so would be expensive and impractical , ap notes .
