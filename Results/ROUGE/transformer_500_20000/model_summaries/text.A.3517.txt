how do the fish that thrive in the waters around antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice ? turns out at least some of them do n't . scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death , but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins , apparently permanently , upi reports . the crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing , but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm , according to research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals , keeping them from getting smaller , the scientists say . lead researcher paul cziko tells the christian science monitor that it 's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies , or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term . " this shows that with every good evolutionary innovation , some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that , " he says . " evolution is a stepwise process . you take two steps forward , and take one step back . " ( researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in antarctic waters . )
