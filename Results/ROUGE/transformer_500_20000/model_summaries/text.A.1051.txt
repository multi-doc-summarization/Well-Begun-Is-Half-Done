now even the great apes are getting in on debunking " fake news " —or , to be more specific , fake beliefs . german researchers have found that the primates can tell when a human is wrong about something , and can even help to remedy the situation , which in this case was assisting a human in finding an object mistakenly believed to be in one location but actually in another , afp reports . the study published in the plos one journal , which revamped a test usually administered to 18-month-old human babies , sought to see if the 34 chimps , bonobos , and orangutans at germany 's leipzig zoo could understand if a human was harboring a false belief , believed to be a sign of advanced social cognition apes were n't previously believed to possess . a press release lays out the experiment , which involved the apes watching while person a put an object under one of two boxes , then either stayed in the room and watched ( the " true belief " part of the experiment ) or left the room ( the " false belief " part ) while a second person then moved the object to the second box . in both cases , person a then went to the original box to try to open it , ostensibly not knowing in the false-belief cases the object had been moved—and in those false-belief cases , the apes , who 'd been observing the whole thing and had been trained to unlock the boxes , tried more often than would be attributed to chance to guide the humans to where the object really was . these results are said to be the first to show that apes can use this " mind-reading " and apply it to their social interactions , the researchers write . ( an animal expert says it 's moral to keep apes in a zoo . )
