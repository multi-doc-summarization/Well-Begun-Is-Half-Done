chris christie got back in the national spotlight in a way he prefers today—as a featured speaker at the annual cpac convention for conservatives . the new jersey governor took particular aim at the media ( " we 've got to stop letting the media define who we are and what we stand for " ) and president obama ( " man , that 's leadership , is n't it ? " ) , reports politico . he also advised members of the gop and the tea party that it 's time to " start talking about what we 're for and not what we 're against . " the ap called it an " aggressive message , " and jennifer rubin at the washington post writes that he was back to his " pugnacious self , " but the sentiment was n't unanimous . time says the " humbled " governor delivered an " uncharacteristically low-key message . " either way , the crowd seemed to warm up to christie as he went along and rewarded him with a standing ovation at the end , writes eliana johnson at the national review . rubin sums up : " christie is still an impressive speaker who knows how to hold a room ’ s attention . if he is no longer the gop front-runner , neither can he be ignored in 2016 . "
