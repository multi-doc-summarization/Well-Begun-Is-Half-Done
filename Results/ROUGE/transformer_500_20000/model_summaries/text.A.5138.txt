the family of one of four missing young men in pennsylvania got the news they were dreading wednesday night when authorities announced that the body of 19-year-old dean finocchiaro had been found in a deep grave on a suburban philadelphia farm . district attorney matthew weintraub said the body was found in a " common grave " more than 12 feet deep , though he did n't say whether the other remains found belong to the three other men who vanished last week , the washington post reports . the farm belongs to the family of cosmo dinardo , a " person of interest " in the case who was arrested wednesday for stealing a car belonging to one of the missing men , the new york times reports . dinardo , 20 , was bailed out by his father late tuesday after being arrested on a weapons charge from earlier this year . bail on the new charges has been set at $ 5 million . " we bought ourselves a little bit of time " with the stolen car charge , weintraub told reporters early thursday , adding that homicide charges are being seriously looked at . eric beitz , a friend of one of the missing men , tells the philadelphia inquirer that dinardo sold drugs and guns and once boasted about having somebody killed . " cosmo has spoken about weird things like killing people and having people killed , " beitz says . " everybody you talk to about this guy , you hear he â€™ s mentally unstable . "
