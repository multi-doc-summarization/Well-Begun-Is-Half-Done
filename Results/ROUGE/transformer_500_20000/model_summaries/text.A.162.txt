searching for a good deal on a used treadmill ? look no further than afghanistan , where the us military is selling off 2 million to 14 million pounds of its equipment every week , as it winds down operations there . there 's just one catch , reports the washington post : most of the equipment is destroyed so parts ca n't be made into bombs . " many non-military items have timing equipment or other components in them that can pose a threat . for example , timers can be attached to explosives . treadmills , stationary bikes , many household appliances and devices , et cetera , have timers , " explains a pentagon spokesperson . all the equipment would be too expensive to bring back to the us , so now a scrap yard near bagram is piled high with air conditioners , trucks , and tvs that do n't work . and the locals are n't impressed . " the russians didn ’ t break their things before they sold them to us , " says one customer . meanwhile , the post reports in a separate article , afghanistan 's army is struggling with broken equipment it ca n't fix . the us had previously been taking care of repairs , but since it stopped , corruption and an undeveloped local supply chain has made finding replacement parts difficult . " the americans gave us the humvees , but they didn ’ t give us the spare parts , " says a local special forces leader . and it does n't help that gear is being pilfered—one special forces commander just defected to a taliban-aligned insurgent group , taking up to 30 guns , night-vision goggles , and a humvee with him , reuters reports .
