if anyone is feeling sympathetic toward north korea as its war of words with the us ramps up , otto warmbier 's family has a message : " north korea is not a victim . they 're terrorists . " in their first lengthy comments since warmbier 's death days after the 22-year-old university of virginia student was released by north korea in june , fred and cindy warmbier lashed out at the north korean regime in an interview with fox & friends on tuesday . they described their first sight of warmbier on a stretcher inside the plane that brought him to the us . he was blind , deaf , and " jerking violently , making these inhuman sounds , " said fred , who also said " it looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth . " there were other injuries , too , including a large scar on his right foot , the couple says . warmbier—whom doctors believe suffered brain damage consistent with cardiopulmonary arrest—died less than a week later , per the washington post . a north korean foreign ministry rep at the time said only that warmbier had fallen into a coma linked to botulism during his 17-month imprisonment for subversion , but that his death was " a mystery . " in reality , " they kidnapped otto . they tortured him " and " they destroyed him , " his parents told fox & friends , asking that north korea be listed as a state sponsor of terrorism . president trump referred to the " great " interview in a tweet tuesday , noting " otto was tortured beyond belief by north korea .
