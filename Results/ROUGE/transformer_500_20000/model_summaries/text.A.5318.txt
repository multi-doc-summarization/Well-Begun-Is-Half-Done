john kerry said it . joe biden said it . but now the person who truly matters has said it : president obama has concluded that syria used chemical weapons , he tells pbs newshour . obama , however , said he has not made a decision about a possible military strike . the president said it 's clear that chemical weapons were used , and he said the us has ruled out the possibility that the rebels were responsible , as bashar al-assad 's government claims . " we have concluded that the syrian government , in fact , carried these out , and if that 's so , then there need to be international consequences . " the us is in consultation with its allies , he said , adding that " i have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict on syria . " pressed on what such a limited action would accomplish , obama said it would send a " pretty strong signal " to the assad regime that it must stop the chemical attacks . the bigger message to assad ? " you are not only breaking international norms and standards of decency , but you 're also creating a situation where us national interests are affected . "
