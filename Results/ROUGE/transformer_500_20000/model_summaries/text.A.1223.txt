president obama was greeted with some unexpected spice at the end of his town hall meeting in iowa last night , when the founder of the iowa tea party confronted him about joe biden 's alleged remark that tea party members acted like " terrorists " ( the vp denies saying it ) . obama did n't directly respond in public , but did tell ryan rhodes that " as someone who ’ s been called a socialist , not born here , taking away freedoms for providing health care , i ’ m all for lowering the rhetoric . " the two then apparently held a brief but " animated " private conversation , reports greta van susteren 's gretawire . in a subsequent interview with fox news , rhodes said of his encounter with obama , " he just denied it , he said the vice president didn ’ t make any of those assertions . he doesn ’ t want to even admit what was on tv nationally . " audio of their discussion was not available . some attendees at the iowa meeting disapproved of rhodes ' questioning , with one woman telling him it was " extraordinarily rude . " unapologetic , rhodes said of the exchange , “ i said my piece . "
