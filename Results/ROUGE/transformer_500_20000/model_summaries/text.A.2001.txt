the spacecraft that landed on a comet yesterday is still talking to scientists , but its battery is expected to conk out soon . in what could be a last-ditch effort to save the mission , scientists with the european space agency say they 'll try to make the philae lander essentially hop to a different spotâ€”one in which it might get more juice in the form of sunlight for its solar panels , reports the guardian . researchers still do n't know exactly where the lander is , only that it 's surrounded by rocks blocking most sunlight , perhaps next to a cliff , reports the bbc . in the meantime , the lander has begun drilling about 10 inches deep into the comet to collect samples that scientists would love to analyze , given that they are presumably billions of years old , reports the ap . the question is whether the battery will hold out long enough to transmit any data , while the very act of drilling is draining it further . " maybe the battery will be empty before we contact again , " says stephan ulamec , head of the lander mission . the battery is n't expected to last beyond tomorrow , but if esa is able to shift the lander to a sunnier locale , the data collection could go on for months . ( the landing hit a few glitches , including anchoring harpoons that did n't fire . )
