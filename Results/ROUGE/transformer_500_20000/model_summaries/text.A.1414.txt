two horrified anti-abortion county commissioners in oregon have ordered a waste-to-energy plant to stop burning any medical waste until it can be sure that no fetal tissue is being incinerated . the marion county plant burns large amounts of biomedical waste from british columbia , and the commissioners say they were disgusted to learn from a report in a catholic newspaper that some of the 14,000 fetuses aborted in the canadian province every year are " incinerated to provide electricity to the people of marion county , " the national post reports . the commissioners say there has to be " a process to figure out how we can accept legitimate medical waste , " including amputated limbs and cancerous tissue , but accepting fetal tissue is out of the question , reports the oregonian . " it 's inappropriate to put them in the trash , " one commissioner says . a spokeswoman for the incinerator firm says that while the medical waste may have contained fetal tissue including umbilical cords or placentas , it did not contain whole fetuses . she says the company is cooperating with the order to stop accepting medical waste while new procedures are put in place , the ap reports . last month , the uk banned the incineration of fetal remains after learning that thousands of fetuses had been burned for power .
