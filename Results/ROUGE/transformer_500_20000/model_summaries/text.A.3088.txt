december 's deadly gang-rape in new delhi put a spotlight on the country 's ugly problem of sexual assault . but india faces another terrible sexual abuse failingâ€”this one involving its children . human rights watch today released an 82-page report on the rampant sexual abuse of indian children , reports al-jazeera . though the report relies on in-depth case studies of 100 abuse victims rather than a " quantitative analysis , " it does highlight a 2007 survey of 12,500 at-risk children that found a stunning 53.2 % of those questioned had faced one or more forms of sexual abuse ; 72 % of those victims say they told no one . " shockingly the very institutions that should protect vulnerable children can place them at risk of horrific child sexual abuse , " said hrw 's south asia director . india 's poorly trained and poorly paid police often refuse to register complaints ; children who do report abuse and are seen by a doctor often undergo traumatic exams . last year india finally passed its first law banning child sex abuse , but that 's not enough , says hrw . " the criminal justice system , from the time police receive a complaint until trials are completed , needs urgent reform . " see the full report here .
