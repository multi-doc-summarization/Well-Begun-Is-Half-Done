the illness and death of fiat chrysler 's fast-charging , unconventional ceo may have seemed sudden and surprising to many , but sergio marchionne was apparently sick for longer than anyone—even his employer—knew . that news comes to the wall street journal from university hospital zurich , which notes marchionne had a " serious illness " for which he sought treatment at the hospital for more than a year . in a statement issued to get ahead of " further speculation , " uhz says it gave the ailing marchionne " all the options offered by cutting-edge medicine , " though it did n't detail what exactly he was being treated for . and because of patient privacy rules , fiat chrysler says it was in the dark about marchionne 's issues . " the company had no knowledge of the facts relating to mr. marchionne 's health , " a company spokesman says , per reuters , adding it was n't until july 20 that it " was made aware with no detail by mr. marchionne 's family of the serious deterioration in mr. marchionne 's condition . " the reason that 's important is because " material " information about a company is required to be divulged to shareholders under securities laws . whether a high-level exec 's health counts as " material " can get murky , but a company can get itself into trouble if it puts out " half-truths or inconsistent statements , " a northwestern university professor tells the journal . in february , fiat chrysler 's annual report noted that marchionne 's hands-on involvement in the company was " critical to the execution of our strategic direction and implementation of our business plan , " reports cnnmoney .
