looks like the honeymoon might be over : president-elect donald trump complained on twitter thursday night about " unfair " protests against him , which continued for a second night . " just had a very open and successful presidential election . now professional protesters , incited by the media , are protesting . very unfair ! " he tweeted in his first public comment on the protests . but his tune was changed by this 6am tweet , which read , " love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country . we will all come together and be proud ! " the washington post notes that after president obama was re-elected in 2012 , trump urged people to " fight like hell " and tweeted : " we ca n't let this happen . we should march on washington and stop this travesty . our nation is totally divided ! " the los angeles times reports that the many of the anti-trump demonstrations around the country thursday night were not as big as the protests on wednesday , though some organizers say they are planning bigger rallies over the weekend . one city where things intensified was portland , ore. , where police declared the protest to be a riot because of " extensive criminal and dangerous behavior , " cnn reports . the bbc reports that protests remained largely peaceful in cities including philadelphia , baltimore , denver , minneapolis , chicago , and new york city , where a crowd gathered outside trump tower for a second night .
