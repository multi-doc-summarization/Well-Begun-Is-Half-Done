microsoft is releasing a patch today to fix a vulnerability in its windows os—but not before a cyberespionage campaign against ukrainian government employees and an american expert on russia took place . according to the isight cyberintelligence firm , which discovered the bug last month , hackers sent malicious powerpoints to users on windows vista , 7 , or 8 , then activated the bug to control users ' computers , the wall street journal reports . the hack was part of a larger operation that also spied on nato , the eu , and energy and telecommunications companies , reuters reports . isight does n't know for sure who 's behind the hacking , but it notes that a ) one of the hackers is fluent in russian ; b ) the herculean effort suggests a well-supported team ( i.e. , helped out by a country 's government ) ; and c ) the targets the hackers went after suggest russian interests . what worries security experts is that even though there 's now a patch to protect against the breach , the hacking world will try to gain access to users ' computers before they have a chance to install the fix . " every criminal and their brother is going to be trying to exploit this flaw in the next few weeks , " an aclu technologist tells the journal . perhaps even more mysterious than who 's behind the hacking is the information embedded in the software code : isight says it ’ s calling the spy operation " sandworm team , " reuters notes , because of multiple references found within the hackers ' code to dune—the sandworm was the toothy , desert-dwelling creature featured in the sci-fi movie , book , and tv series . ( chinese hackers accessed personal data for us federal employees earlier this year . )
