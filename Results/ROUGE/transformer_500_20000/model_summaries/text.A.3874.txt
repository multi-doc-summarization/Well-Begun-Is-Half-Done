as donald trump pledged his loyalty to his own party inside trump tower yesterday , things got a little ugly outside . police were called after trump security guards scuffled with anti-trump protesters on the sidewalk outside the new york city tower , ny1 reports . the guards took signs away from the protesters and one man was hit in the face after he grabbed the guard who had taken his " trump : make america racist again " banner , reports the new york times . the trump campaign says the guard was " jumped " and that it 's considering pressing charges , reports the times , which notes that the trump staffer involved looks a lot like the one who removed univision 's jorge ramos from a trump event last week . the protesters—some of whom dressed in kkk outfits to mock trump 's immigration policies—are also threatening to press charges , cnn reports . trump , meanwhile , had what the washington post says would have been a damaging moment for an ordinary campaign when he appeared on conservative radio host hugh hewitt 's show last night . after trump failed to recognize the names of the leaders of hezbollah , isis , al-qaeda , or the nusra front , he accused hewitt of asking " gotcha questions " and said the names did n't matter because they 'll " all be changed " by the time he 's in the white house . hewitt said he might bring the names up again when he asks questions at the next republican debate , the post notes . ( trump does not approve of jeb bush speaking spanish . )
