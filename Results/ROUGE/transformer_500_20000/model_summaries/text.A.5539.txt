the leaders of the episcopal church have approved same-sex marriage by a more resounding margin than the supreme court did last week : the church 's house of deputies voted 173-27 in favor of new rules and rituals that will allow same-sex couples to be married in church , the ap reports . the house of bishops backed the changes 129-26 on tuesday . the church , which is the american member of the anglican communion , was seen as a trailblazer when it elected an openly gay bishop in 2003 and is now the third major protestant group to allow gay marriage in all congregations , after the united church of christ and the presbyterian church , which voted to redefine marriage earlier this year , the ap notes . it took a week of debate at the church 's general convention to bring in the changes , which include ditching terms like " wife " and " husband " for gender-neutral language , the deseret news reports . the final product of the negotiations was a compromise that allows clergy to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies , which means that although such ceremonies may begin in some areas this fall , they are unlikely to be held in more conservative dioceses , episcopal priest george conger explains at the washington post . " what the bishops did agree on was to hold conflicting stances in tension and allow each side to honor their consciences , " he writes .
