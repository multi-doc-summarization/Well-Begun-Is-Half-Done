between march and september of last year , four out of five visits to a major part of the dark web—the anonymous corner of the internet—were to sites exhibiting the sexual abuse of children , says a new study picked up by wired . these sites account for only 2 % of the dark web , but got five times more traffic ( or about 83 % ) than other sites , like those selling drugs , offering gambling , or providing a haven for whistleblowers . " before we did this study , it was certainly my view that the dark net is a good thing . but it ’ s … creating a place where pedophiles can act with impunity , " says uk computer science researcher gareth owen . the websites studied are part of tor hidden services—which allows users to surf the web anonymously , bbc explains—and they occupy the biggest chunk of the dark web . owen used relay computers and a web-crawling program to collect his data . tor executives point out the results could be distorted , and owen acknowledges that " caution is advised " when assessing them . " we do not know the cause of the high hit count ( to child abuse sites ) and can not say with any certainty that it corresponds with humans , " he says . it 's possible the traffic could be caused by law enforcement groups conducting investigations or hackers flooding the sites with fake visits . and then there 's the positive justification for an anonymous web . " there are important uses for hidden services , such as when human rights activists use them to access facebook or to blog anonymously , " says tor 's executive director . still , law enforcement and politicians are expected to push for a crackdown because of the study , and owen says there may be ways to block child abuse sites . ( a chunk of the dark web was shut down in november . )
