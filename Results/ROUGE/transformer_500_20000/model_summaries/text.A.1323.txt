former louisiana gov . edwin edwards has decided that neither age—nor his status as an ex-con—is a barrier to a run for congress . the 86-year-old democrat , who was released from federal prison in 2011 after serving eight years on fraud and racketeering charges , has entered the race for the state 's 6th congressional district and says he 's convinced he can win , the times-picayune reports . the four-term governor has always maintained his innocence on fraud charges connected to state licensing of riverboat casinos , the los angeles times notes . " i acknowledge there are good reasons i should not run . but there are better reasons why i should , " said edwards , who starred in a reality tv show after getting out of prison . he says he 'd really like to run for governor again , but because of his conviction , state law bans him from doing so until he 's 101 years old . analysts say that while edwards certainly has name recognition on his side , he will struggle to make headway in the heavily republican district centered on baton rouge . " this changes the race . it ’ s sure to stir up some notoriety ... but i don ’ t think he has a chance of winning , " a political scientist tells the baton rouge advocate .
