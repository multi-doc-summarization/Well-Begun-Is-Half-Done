" this is reality , not a threat , " the north korean leader said , though he also said he was " open to dialogue " with south korea and suggested his country might send a delegation to the winter olympics being held in the south next month , the bbc reports . he said north korea will focus on mass-producing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in 2018 , but these " weapons will be used only if our security is threatened . " " we should melt the frozen north-south relations , " kim said , adding that the " winter games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people , and we wish the games will be a success . " john delury at seoul 's yonsei university tells the washington post that kim 's words " should give hope to those in the south who are trying to get something going and open a channel at least . " he says kim may be trying to drive a wedge between seoul and washington , though the fact that the north korean leader refrained from insulting president trump may be a good sign . asked about kim 's " nuclear button " remarks by reporters at the mar-a-lago new year 's eve party , trump said " we 'll see .
