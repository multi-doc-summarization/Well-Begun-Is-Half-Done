it 's hard to imagine an attempt at heroism going worse than the one kristopher oswald attempted sunday . the 30-year-old walmart employee was taking a lunch break in his car at around 2:30am ( he worked as an overnight stocker ) , when he heard a woman screaming for help and saw a man on the hood of her car . he approached and asked if the woman needed help , and the man lunged at him , he tells wxyz . oswald got on top of his attacker , only to be jumped from behind by two other men . police came to his rescue soon thereafter . but the last blow landed later when walmart fired him over the incident . a company spokesman tells the ap that they fully understand that he was trying to help , but that he violated walmart 's anti-violence policy . oswald was stunned . " the last thing i expected was to not have a job , " he says . " i do n't even know what to put on an application about all this . how do i say this ended ? "
