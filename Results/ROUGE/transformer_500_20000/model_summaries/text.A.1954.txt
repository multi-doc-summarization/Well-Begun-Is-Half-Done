since july , hillary clinton 's team has been fighting findings by the intelligence community 's inspector general that she housed classified information on her private email server . but a special intelligence review by the cia and the national geospatial-intelligence agency just bolstered the original proclamation , finding that two emails she received in 2009 and 2011 via that server were considered " top secret , " including an email about north korea 's nukes , the new york times reports , citing senior intelligence officials speaking anonymously . clinton 's campaign is doubling down , however , with a rep accusing the discovery process of being tainted by " bureaucratic infighting " and a state department spokesman proclaiming that " classification is rarely a black and white question . … at this time , any conclusion about the classification of the documents in question would be premature . " the " top secret " designation , signed off on by president obama in a 2009 executive order , is bestowed on info that , if revealed , " could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to … national security . " but clinton herself backed up her rep 's assessment , telling the ap yesterday in iowa that " there is always a debate among different agencies about [ whether ] something should be retroactively [ marked classified ] . " when asked why she is n't offering up any direct apologies , she added , " what i did was allowed . it was allowed by the state department . the state department has confirmed that . i did not send or receive any information marked classified . i take the responsibilities of handling classified materials very seriously and did so . " ( clinton did recently apologize for this matter being " confusing to people . " )
