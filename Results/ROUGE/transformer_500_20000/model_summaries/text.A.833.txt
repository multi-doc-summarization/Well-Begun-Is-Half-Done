the supreme court on wednesday will hear arguments in a death row case , but this one has an unusual element . the case involves robert mccoy , who is currently on louisiana 's death row after being convicted of a triple homicide back in 2011 . mccoy has always maintained his innocence , but his attorney , robert english , defied mccoy 's wishes during the trial and told the jury that mccoy was guilty—figuring it was the only hope of avoiding a death sentence , explains nbc news . the gambit did n't work , however . mccoy was convicted and sentenced to death , and now mccoy is arguing that his constitutional right to mount a defense was violated . more background and developments : the crime : mccoy is accused of killing his estranged wife 's teenage son , mother , and stepfather , while searching for his wife , and the washington post reports that prosecutors had compelling evidence . on a 911 call , mccoy 's mother-in-law could be heard saying , " she ain ’ t here , robert . i don ’ t know where she is , " before a gunshot rings out and the call is disconnected . witnesses saw mccoy 's car leaving the area , and cops later found the phone his mother-in-law used to call 911 in the vehicle .
