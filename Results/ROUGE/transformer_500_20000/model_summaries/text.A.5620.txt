note to tweeting politicians : watch what you post , because politwoops will remember it forever . the transparency-minded website is safeguarding politicians ' deleted tweets , enabling the rest of us to giggle or ponder over them at our leisure , the atlantic reports . the site 's current 6-month stash includes a few doozey deletions , including john mccain mocking vladimir putin 's tears and rep. jeff miller posting a link to a poll that asked , " was obama born in the united states ? " a few deletions are more odd than obvious , begging us to ask what politicians were thinking . why , for example , did rep. tom graves remove a tweet about going out one night with his wife ? or rep. kathy hochul delete one about her visit to a cancer institute ? perhaps rep. stephen fincher 's tweet comparing the bachelor to the hunger games is a more obvious case , but the online avenues of a politician 's mind can be dimly lit indeed .
