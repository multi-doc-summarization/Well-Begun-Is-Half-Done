the pleas for mercy were n't enough , apparently . despite uproar from several foreign governments , indonesia is readying for the executions of eight foreigners and one local man convicted of drug trafficking . a dozen ambulances—nine of which were carrying coffins—boarded a ferry to besi prison on nusakambangan island today , while inmates ' family members made what are now considered last visits , the ap reports . one relative described the goodbye as " torture , " while another collapsed in agony , reports the bbc . though it was believed frenchman serge atlaoui would be executed , indonesia 's ag says an outstanding appeal will save his life for now . it is n't clear when the executions will occur , but protocol suggests the inmates could be shot by a firing squad just after midnight local time . some in australia , including actor guy pearce , have criticized prime minister tony abbott for failing to visit indonesia and bring home its two nationals , myuran sukumaran and andrew chan , who were caught trying to smuggle heroin out of the country in 2005 . chan married his indonesian christian pastor yesterday . " clearly if traveling to indonesia would make a difference , we would have gone there , " australia 's foreign minister says , adding " while they are still alive , there is still hope . " the bbc reports indonesia indicated it would not stay the two inmates ' executions despite a corruption investigation into the case . meanwhile , a friend of sukumaran says the inmate will choose not to be blindfolded before 12 gunmen , three of whom will have live rounds , reports the guardian . " myuran always said to me that he would never take this lying down ; that he would stare them down , that no one would cover his eyes , that he would face it with dignity . "
