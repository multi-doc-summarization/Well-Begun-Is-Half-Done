isis has killed 1,878 people in syria—most of them civilians—over the six-month period since it proclaimed a caliphate in parts of iraq and syria in late june , according to the syrian observatory for human rights . among the victims : four children , eight women , members of an opposing sunni muslim tribe , soldiers of syrian president bashar al-assad , insurgents fighting against assad , foreign activists and journalists , and even about 120 of its own fighters . although reuters says it has n't been able to independently confirm the british organization 's numbers , it notes the publicized stonings and beheadings that isis has conducted for what it sees as offenses against islam , ranging from adultery and homosexuality to blasphemy and stealing . by the monitor 's count , 1,175 civilians have been beheaded , stoned , or shot ; about 930 of those civilians were part of the shaitat , a sunni muslim tribe that fought isis in eastern syria . a mass grave containing 230 shaitat bodies was said to have been discovered in mid-december , al arabiya reports . but the tally may even be on the low side , al arabiya notes : the observatory references " hundreds of missing and detainees inside the is jails , loss of communication with about a thousand men of al-shaitaat tribe , [ and ] ... dozens of kurds who have still been missing since ... september 16 . " ( a recent isis execution video is said to have major differences from past videos . )
