many roman catholics saw journalist james foley—who was kidnapped , tortured , and beheaded by isis—as a symbol of enduring faith under horrible circumstances . then it came out that he had converted to islam in captivity . now what ? " the answer is we can ’ t assess it , " says a jesuit preist who calls foley " a good and holy man " but casts doubt on his conversion . " we can not look at what is in someone ’ s soul . " foley 's story is further complicated by his own apparent confusion , the new york times reports . first kidnapped in libya in 2011 , foley says he prayed with muslim cellmates who opposed the gadhafi government . after washing himself , he was told he had converted . " so , from then on out , i prayed with them five times a day , " he says in a youtube video . " but it was difficult . i was thinking , 'jesus , am i praying to allah ? am i violating my belief in you ? ' " he adds . " i don ’ t have an answer to that . i just know that i was authentically with them , and i was authentically praying to jesus . " kidnapped again in syria in 2012 , he converted to islam in captivity and appeared sincere about it , freed hostages say . but people are debating whether foley , once an altar boy in a catholic family , converted for himself or his captors ( as this getreligion article attests ) . " i believe , much like in libya , jim 'converted ' for the purpose of surviving , " says one of his brothers . pope francis has apparently called foley a martyr and says other christian martyrs are being " tortured , massacred " today , ansa reports . yet foley 's mother , a eucharistic minister , seems unsure : " only god and jim know what was going on in his heart , " she says .
