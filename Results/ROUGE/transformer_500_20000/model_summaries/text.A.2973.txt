if we 're being honest , the selfie is pass√© . today 's discerning instagrammers require a new way to document their every waking moment . enter the nokia 8 and its " bothie . " nokia 's attempt to compete with samsung and apple in the high-end smartphone market hits stores in europe in september . wired reports the nokia 8 is standard stuff for a high-end smartphone ; it 's got 64 gigs of storage , 4 gigs of ram , a 5.3-inch screen , and so on . and the verge came away fairly unimpressed by the phone , calling it " average , " especially compared to what apple apparently has planned for its new phone . the one thing the nokia 8 does have , and what it could live or die on , is the bothie . the bothie uses dual sight technology to let users take photos or videos using both the front and rear cameras at the same time , the guardian explains . the resulting video or image shows whatever is in front of the user alongside the user 's reaction to it . those photos and videos can then be shared directly to facebook or youtube . wired calls the bothie the nokia 8 's " only truly unique feature , " meaning the phone was made " for the youtubers and instagrammers of the world . " and they 'll have to embrace the bothie if nokia has any chance of competing with apple and samsung . meanwhile , the future of the american bothie is unclear , as nokia has not announced plans to bring the phone to the us .
