from the front , a half-million-dollar home on the re/max website looks like a quaint spanish revival in the heart of seattle . head to the side for a different perspective , and you 'll see appearances are deceiving . you 're looking at what yahoo says locals call the " montlake spite house , " an 860-square-foot sliver of a house that 's legendary even among tiny houses . the front of the pie-shaped home built in 1925 is just 15 feet wide , while the back comes in at under 5 feet wide , komo reported in 2013 , the last time the house was up for sale . eugene smith , a retired professor at the university of washington who wrote a book on area history , says the wedge-like residence " was certainly the oddest of all the bungalows " in the area . " it was the smallest , most peculiar shape , " he told komo . and the story behind its supposedly spiteful construction is just as strange as its shape . yahoo dug up a few origin tales , including that it may have been built by an enraged landowner to spite a neighbor for a lowball offer on the land , per the stranger . it also may have been a revenge move by a long-ago owner , said to have given permission for someone to build a home while he was traveling , as long as there was room left for his own house , which â€¦ there was n't , really , quirksee has reported . but one of the catchiest stories , offered by the oregonian , claims a divorce judge awarded the original , larger home to the husband , and a tiny portion of land to the wife , who then built this minuscule abode to be up in her ex 's face . these days there 's a law on the books against such a " malicious erection , " which involves building a structure to purposely " spite , injure or annoy " neighbors by blocking their view , access , or light . ( a secret of the " tiny house " movement . )
