seafood producers from alaska to northern california have been hit hard by a chinese ban on imports of west coast shellfish , the seattle times reports . china says it has suspended imports indefinitely after high levels of arsenic and other toxins were found in a shipment of geoduck clams , but fish companies are crying foul , noting that even in the area where the clams were harvested , health authorities have found no evidence of toxins anywhere near harmful levels . officials say that chinese authorities have never imposed such a widespread ban on shellfish before and although the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is expected to enter negotiations with the chinese government , the closure could last months , forcing seafood producers to find new markets or lay off thousands of workers . " it 's had an incredible impact , " the geoduck harvest coordinator for puget sound 's suquamish tribe tells kuow . " a couple thousand divers out of work right now . "
