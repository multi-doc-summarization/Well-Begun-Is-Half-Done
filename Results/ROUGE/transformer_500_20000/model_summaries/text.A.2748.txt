michigan gov . rick snyder admits he lost the public 's trust in failing to respond quickly to concerns about flint 's drinking water . " i 'm sorry i let you down , " he said during his state of the state address on tuesday . " your families face a crisis—a crisis you did not create and could not have prevented , " he added , per abc news . " i 'm sorry , and i will fix it . " almost two years after corrosive drinking water from the flint river was contaminated with lead in april 2014 , snyder says he 's asking legislators for $ 28 million to replace water supply pipes in flint 's schools , daycares , and hospitals ; treat children with high lead levels ; conduct environmental assessments ; and more , per cnn . however , flint mayor karen weaver says the costs to fix the water issues and address health concerns could reach $ 1.5 billion . " we will provide resources to help anyone and everyone [ affected ] , " snyder said , noting he takes " full responsibility " for fixing this " catastrophe . " he also vowed to release all of his emails relating to flint from 2014 and 2015 . though some residents claim the state ignored the water issues for months , " we took action … as soon as i became aware of elevated lead levels in blood " on oct. 1 , 2015 , snyder told time last week , noting bottled water , water filters , and water testing kits were handed out . snyder lays blame on the michigan department of environmental quality , which told residents the water was safe to drink , though some homes showed toxic lead levels . the department admitted it did n't get the necessary chemicals to treat the corrosive water . residents have now filed three lawsuits at the federal , state , and municipal levels .
