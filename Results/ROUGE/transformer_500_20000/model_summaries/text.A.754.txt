the controversy over separating immigrant children from their parents continues , this time thanks to words from a fox & friends co-host . per mediaite , brian kilmeade took to the airwaves friday morning , staunchly defending president trump 's moves on dealing with immigrants trying to enter the us . " he 's trying to send a message to the other countries : this is not the way you do it , because this is a country that has rules and laws , " he said to co-hosts ainsley earhardt and steve doocy . but it was his remarks on the separations specifically that raised the ire of many . " like it or not , these are n't our kids , " he noted . " show 'em compassion , but it 's not like [ trump ] is doing this to the people of idaho or texas . these are people from another country . " twitter erupted in slams , while , per huffpost , msnbc 's stephanie ruhle addressed any insinuation that those opposed to trump 's moves care more about migrant kids than us kids : " please â€¦ your propaganda , that anyone is putting the life of a migrant child ahead of the life of an american child , is simply nonsense . it 's ignorant . it 's stupid . it 's wrong . " kilmeade later clarified his comments on twitter , tweeting , " of course-i did n't mean to make it seem like children coming into the u.s. illegally are less important because they live in another country . i have compassion for all children , especially for all the kids separated from their parents right now . " he also said he was pleased kids were " on their way " to being reunited with their parents and put up a clip from his fox news radio show , where he reiterated , " all kids are important . all kids are special .
