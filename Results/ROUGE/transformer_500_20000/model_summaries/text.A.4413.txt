as a well-known media personality in israel and the wife of one of the country 's most powerful politicians , judy shalom nir-mozes has a lot of twitter followersâ€”and a lot of people to offend when she does something like tweet a racist joke about another country 's leader . " do you know what obama coffee is ? black and weak , " she tweeted yesterday , quickly drawing responses like , " have you gone mad ? " reports the guardian . she quickly deleted the offending post , tweeting " i shouldnt have written the inappropriate joke i heard . i like people no matter about their race and religion . " nir-mozes , whose husband is interior minister silvan shalom , apologized for repeating the joke and quipped that her husband might leave her , the guardian reports . last month , nir-mozes deleted another tweet sent soon after president obama launched his twitter account , the times of israel reports . " @ potus well come , i hope u 'll write from the hurt of barack , and not from the head of rrsedent obama . kisses from israel , " she wrote , apparently meaning " heart " instead of " hurt . "
