a month after three women and a young girl were found captive in a cleveland home , reuters checks in on the victims ' situation , or at least their financial state . the cleveland courage fund , a tax-free trust set up in their name , has been flooded with donations and now totals $ 825,000 . the victims have begun dipping into the money , which will be split evenly among gina dejesus , michelle knight , amanda berry , and berry 's six-year-old daughter . " the outpouring of public support has been nothing short of remarkable , " the victims previously said in a letter via abc news . " the community is acting in a way you would hope they would act , " the fund 's co-trustee told reuters , adding the money will help the women with whatever they need . " ten years out of society means not finishing school , no job training , and not learning how to drive . " it 's not only money that 's being offered up . doctors and dentists have volunteered their services , while others have donated the use of vacation homes and cars . meanwhile , reuters reports neighborhood residents have talked about tearing down ariel castro 's now boarded-up house and planting four oak trees in its place .
