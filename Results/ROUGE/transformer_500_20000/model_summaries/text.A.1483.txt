" ben smith , buzzfeed : romney 's biggest task was to prove " he could stand on stage with president barack obama as an equal and a plausible president of the united states . " check . matt miller , washington post : well played , romney . miller expected him to track to the middle more quickly after the primaries , but maybe this is better . " if he wins , of course , romney and his advisers will be hailed as geniuses for their timing , for bonding the party faithful to the ticket with the choice of paul ryan and a conservative-themed convention , and then dashing to the center for the home stretch .
