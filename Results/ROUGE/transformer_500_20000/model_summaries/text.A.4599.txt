a tiny creature grew inside a florida woman for two months after her honeymoon in belize—and no , she was n't pregnant . weeks after returning home , the 36-year-old noticed an itchy spot on the left side of her groin and assumed she 'd been bitten by an insect , reports live science . thinking it was an infected spider bite , her doctor fruitlessly prescribed antibiotics . dr. enrico camporesi of tampa 's memorial hospital next took a look , noticing a hole in the center of the wound , which felt hard , as though something were inside . a surgeon suspected it was a living thing , and turned out to be right . cutting open the lesion , doctors found a tapered human botfly larva with rows of spines and hooks meant to keep it buried in the woman 's skin for up to 128 days , reports the miami herald . commonly found in central america , a human botfly first deposits her eggs on an insect , like a mosquito , which carries them to human or animal hosts . injected in skin via bites , the egg hatches into larva that eventually drops from the skin and continues developing , eventually reaching the size of a large bumblebee , per the journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports . though the botfly did n't reach the pupa stage in this case , it was n't necessary for its human host to go under the knife . belizeans cover lesions—with petroleum jelly , nail polish , and even bacon strips , per the herald—to suffocate larvae , which emerge for air and can be removed with tweezers . still , the florida patient was healed within a week . ( caterpillar larvae might prove useful . )
