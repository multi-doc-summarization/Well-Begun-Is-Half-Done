about 1 % of the us population ( around 3.2 million americans ) has a gambling disorder , per the national center for responsible gaming—and the atlantic tells the tragic story of one of those addicts and how a lawsuit took the entire industry to task for his death . scott stevens was a successful ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in vegas . for six years , his gambling habit spiraled out of control : he sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working , embezzled nearly $ 4 million from his firm , and drained his family 's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life . after his suicide , stacy started researching gambling addiction ( she had n't even known about her husband 's problem ) and filed suit against the west virginia casino where he was a regular , as well as the maker of the slot machines there . experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers , supply ready flows of cash via on-site atms , and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back . but it 's the modern-day slot machines themselves , with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping , that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as " continuous gaming productivity " —so they do n't stop playing . while the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals , terry noffsinger , the lead attorney for the stevens suit , says these addictive machines are not due to " negligence . it 's intentional . " stacy stevens lost her case in west virginia , but noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum , much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers . " the public is learning more about it , " he says . ( read about the tech behind the slot machines here . )
