early yesterday , the cbc announced that it was terminating the employment of q radio host jian ghomeshi , explaining somewhat vaguely that " information came to our attention recently that ... precludes us from continuing our relationship with jian . " the details did n't remain vague for long . the 47-year-old took to facebook last night , writing that " i was given the choice to walk away quietly and to publicly suggest that this was my decision . but ... that would be untrue . " ghomeshi 's version of the truth is that an unnamed " jilted " ex has launched a smear campaign against him , centered around his bedroom activities , which he writes " may not be palatable to some folks . " ghomeshi describes " a mild form of fifty shades of grey " : rough sex that was consensual and involved safe words . the toronto star tells it quite differently : it says it has heard allegations from three women ( none willing to go on the record ) who describe incredibly violent and non-consensual sex . one told the star that ghomeshi had expressed that he would be aggressive , which she took to mean " he would want to pull my hair and have rough sex . ... [ later ] he attacked me . choked me . hit me like i did n't know men hit women . i submitted . " the women told the paper they have not gone to police , reportedly over concerns their names would leak or that sexual texts they sent ghomeshi would be used against them ; they cited the case of carla ciccone , who was lambasted online after publishing a story on xojane about a date she had with a popular radio host and " repulsive sexual predator . " ghomeshi plans to file a $ 50 million suit against the cbc today ; q is one of the most successful shows the network has ever run .
