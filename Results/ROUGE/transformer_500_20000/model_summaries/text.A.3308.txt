to snip or not to snip ? male circumcision carries " low " risks but has " dramatic " benefits , according to draft guidelines released by the cdc yesterday . the long-awaited guidelines say that the procedure can greatly reduce the risk of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases for heterosexual men , reports reuters , which notes that circumcision rates have dropped 10 % to 58 % over the last three decades . circumcision is a personal decision , and the guidelines will stop short of recommending all newborn boys undergo the procedure , but " the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks , " a cdc spokesman tells the ap . the cdc says that circumcision can reduce the risk of a man getting hiv or herpes from a female partner by around 50 % . it also makes sex safer for female partners , although it does n't appear to reduce the risk of contracting stds during anal sex with other men . the draft guidelines—which will face stiff opposition from anti-circumcision groups—say the risk of complications from circumcision is only 0.5 % for newborns , reports the los angeles times . that rises to 9 % among children , then drops to 5 % among adults , though the guidelines—which say circumcised men " generally report minimal or no change in sexual satisfaction or function " —note that waiting for a boy to reach adolescence or adulthood lets him choose for himself .
