like vanilla ice cream ? do n't read this—because the smell of a beaver 's butt is key to at least some vanilla flavoring , time reports . more specifically , beavers like to mark their territory with a musky , vanilla compound located in sacs between the pelvis and the base of the tail . manufacturers have been extracting it for 80 years to flavor foods and perfumes—but it 's tricky , because the compound often mixes with urine and anal gland secretions . " you can milk the anal glands so you can extract the fluid , " wildlife ecologist joanne crawford tells national geographic . " you can squirt it out . it ’ s pretty gross . " but she admits to sticking her nose in there and taking a whiff : " people think i ’ m nuts . i tell them , 'oh , but it ’ s beavers ; it smells really good . ' " for the record , the slimey brown compound is extracted by anesthetizing a beaver and " milking " its nether regions . ice cream sundae , anyone ?
