some users of lsd like taking tiny amounts of the hallucinogenic drug—often by drinking acid-laced water—to experience subtle benefits like increased focus , creativity , or friendliness toward people , livescience reports . " it 's like the coffee to wake up the mind-body connection , " says former poker player martijn schirp , who now writes for highexistence.com . " when i notice it is working , depending on the dosage , time seems to be slowing down a bit , everything seems covered with a layer of extra significance . " schirp says he embraced the practice , called " microdosing , " because it gave him a chance " to get a taste of this without [ the experience ] completely overwhelming me . " but any possible long-term risks are unknown because , as medical daily notes , lsd remains an illegal drug that 's rarely tested . " the unintended consequence is they 've really impeded research and development , " a psychopharmacologist told livescience a couple of years ago . " we can not understand the brain if we 're not studying drugs . " according to one psychologist , lsd does mimic antidepressants like prozac by freeing up the brain 's " feel-good " chemical , serotonin , so microdosing may work as advertised . it 's been around for years , too : lsd inventor albert hofmann microdosed in his old age , and the practice is described in james fadiman 's 2011 book the psychedelic explorer 's guide . yet even schirp admits it 's not always positive : " at times , the experience was still too overwhelming to be productive—i just wanted to lay down or take a walk , " he says . ( recent studies on psychedelic drugs downplay the risk of psychosis and note possible anti-depressant effects . )
