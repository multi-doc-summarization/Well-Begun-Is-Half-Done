one of the most touching moments of the rio olympics has been rewarded with this year 's fair play awards . american runner abbey d'agostino and new zealand 's nikki hamblin , who helped each other finish the race after falling during a women 's 5,000-meter heat , were given the awards saturday night for what the ioc describes as " two separate acts of selflessness and exemplary sportsmanship . " d'agostino , who was accidentally brought down by hamblin , helped the new zealand runner to her feet . hamblin then stayed with her fellow runner when she realized d'agostino had injured her leg in the fall . " winning this award is overwhelming , " says hamblin , per the sydney morning herald . " i am proud [ at ] what we did and truly believe that you can be both a competitor and kind and responsive at the same time , " she says . " everyone comes here to compete , but there are a lot of people who do n't achieve that , and the journey is really important , too . " the ioc decided to allow both women to compete in the final , though d'agostino was too injured to take part , the guardian reports .
