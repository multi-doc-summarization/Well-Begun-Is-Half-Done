matt damon opined this week that the wave of sex harassment and assault claims sweeping hollywood and society at large include " a spectrum of behavior " and that " none of us came here perfect , " and the woman he once dumped on oprah wasted no time in shutting him down . " gosh it ’ s so interesting ( profoundly unsurprising ) how men with all these opinions about women ’ s differentiation between sexual misconduct , assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result , systemically part of the problem , " minnie driver tweeted . she further unloaded to the guardian : " i ’ ve realized that most men , good men , the men that i love , there is a cut-off . they simply can not understand what abuse is like on a daily level . i honestly think that until we get on the same page , you can ’ t tell a woman about their abuse . ... it is so individual and so personal , it ’ s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms , whether he intends it or not. ” damon was also getting zero sympathy from alyssa milano , reports usa today , who tweeted that , " as a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak , " " they all hurt . " " we are not outraged because someone grabbed our a -- -s in a picture . we are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal . we are outraged because we have been gaslighted . we are outraged because we were silenced for so long . " ( damon has said he had no idea that harvey weinstein routinely sexually harassed and assaulted women ; his full interview this week with abc news is here . )
