trenton lewis has never missed a shift and never been late for his 4am shift at a ups facility in little rock , ark. , a dedication driven by his love for his 14-month-old daughter , karmen , per cnn . his attendance is even more impressive when you consider his wakeup time and commute : lewis rolls out of bed at midnight and then , as abc news notes , " in the rain or cold , through some rough areas of town—he walks . " and it 's a 5.5-mile journey one way for the 21-year-old single dad , reports kxan , adding that lewis has been doing this now for seven months . lewis tells katv he did n't have a job when karmen was born , but when she entered his life , " i knew i had to step up . " his pride kept him from mentioning his daily walk to co-workers , but patricia bryant , known as the " queen bee " of the ups site , discovered lewis ' secret—and then , along with her husband , kenneth , set out to find a way to make things easier for lewis . they did so by pooling together nearly $ 2,000 from colleagues and using it to purchase a used saturn for lewis , which they presented to him at a gathering they told him was a " union meeting . " " those keys can not be mine , " he recalls thinking when they revealed the surprise , per katv . his new leave time from home each morning : 3:30am , giving him a few more hours to sleep in . " i knew things were going to get better if i kept coming to work so , that 's just what i did , " lewis tells kxan .
