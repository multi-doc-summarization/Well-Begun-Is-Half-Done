we 're all taking selfies all the time anyway , so we might as well put them to good use . the verge reports mastercard is rolling out " selfie pay " in 14 countries . if additional authentication is needed after online shoppers enter their credit card info , mastercard users will be able to look into their phone or tablet 's camera instead of entering a password , the bbc explains . " consumers hate passwords , " says ajay bhalla , mastercard 's chief of safety and security . he says people use terrible , easily hackable passwords . biometrics , such as facial recognition and the also-debuting fingerprint authentication , could reduce fraud for online shoppers . mastercard tested out " selfie pay " in the us and netherlands and found 92 % of test subjects liked it . cnbc reports it could make online shopping easier , as mastercard found 53 % of people forget their password at least once a week , leading a third of online shoppers to just give up on buying anything . the next step for mastercard is using people 's heartbeats to verify their identity . people 's hearts create their own signature electric signal , and masercard is testing out a bracelet that monitors it continuously and sends that information to nearby devices to authenticate the user . bhalla calls it " constant authentication . " but that 's still a ways off . mastercard 's facial recognition and fingerprint authentication will be rolled out this year .
