for the first time , scientists have successfully implanted living bone grown in a laboratory , live science reports . and while those implants were in miniature pigs , not humans , it 's pretty impressive nonetheless . scientists removed part of the jaw bones of 14 pigs , carved cow thighbones into the right shape , removed all the cells from the cow bones , saturated the cow bones with stem cells from the pigs , and left the bones to grow in the lab . when the new , living bones were implanted in the pigs , they showed impressive regrowth and returned the jaw to full strength , according to science magazine . “ the pigs woke up , and a half-hour later they were eating , ” researcher gordana vunjak-novakovic tells the new york times . “ we thought they would be in pain . but no , they ’ re doing great. ” the researchers published their findings this month in science translational medicine . they want to try the process in humans in the next few years . at the moment , no great options exist for people who need replacement bones due to injuries , birth defects , or diseases . there are titanium replacements or donated bones , but those come with the risk of rejection . doctors replacing facial bones currently take the bone from elsewhere in the patient 's body , but that causes a new injury , and it can be hard to find a large enough chunk of bone to borrow . prior methods of bone regrowth have involved letting the new bone grow inside the body , but researchers say growing it first in a lab could have a number of benefits . ( scientists hope to grow human organs in farm animals . )
