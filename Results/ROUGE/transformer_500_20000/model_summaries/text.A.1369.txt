harvard researchers say five things will help you live longer , and the list is n't all that surprising : exercise , eat a healthy diet , maintain a healthy body weight , do n't drink too much , and do n't smoke . more surprising is just how much of an effect those five combined factors have on longevity—an extra 14 years for women and 12 for men , according to the study in circulation . researchers looked at about 30 years of data on more than 78,000 women and 44,000 men and found that those who were five-for-five on the aforementioned list had a significantly better life expectancy at age 50 than those who did n't abide by any of the healthy habits . for women , it meant an additional 43 years for the healthiest group , compared to 29 years . for men , it meant an additional 37.6 years , compared to 25.5 years . “ when we embarked on this study , i thought , of course , that people who adopted these habits would live longer , " says co-author meir stampfer , per the guardian . " but the surprising thing was how huge the effect was . " the two big factors : those with the healthiest lifestyles were less likely to get cancer or heart disease , notes cnn . the harvard gazette provides some specifics : researchers defined regular exercise as 30 minutes or more per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity ; moderate drinking is roughly one 5-ounce glass of wine per day for women and up to two for men ; and the target body-mass index is between 18.5 and 24.9 . scientists say they undertook the study to better understand why the us has a shorter life expectancy ( 79.3 years ) than most high-income countries . ( another study says it 's all about eating smaller portions . )
