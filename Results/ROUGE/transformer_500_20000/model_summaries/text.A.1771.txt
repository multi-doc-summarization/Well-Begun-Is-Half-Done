call it the road to nowhere . scores of wood ants living near an old nuclear weapons bunker in western poland plunge seemingly to death each year—and their descendants follow them—in a bizarre ritual that has amazed scientists . the story begins with hard-working ants that built a colony atop a defunct soviet-era bunker , reports arstechnica . when metal covering a ventilation pipe rusted way , the ants began tumbling down . what sounds like a death sentence ( they can ’ t climb out , there is no food , and it is very cold ) has turned into a survival story because these worker ants keep doing what they always do : building until they die . and when they do ? " a younger generation is on its way , ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless , pointless labor , " reports inverse . researchers write in the journal of hymenoptera that a million or so trapped ants have managed to carry on in a virtual cold war nightmare , living in a near-starvation state and total darkness . the colony rests atop a thick cemetery of ant ancestors , indicating this has been going on for quite some time . zoologists who stumbled upon the odd discovery in templewo while counting bats doubted cannibalism was keeping the insects alive , suggesting bat excrement could be doing the trick . the ants produce no offspring , and so the colony 's survival depends on surface ants making the same mistake they did . wood ants are known to be resilient , though , with one colony surviving on a barren islet for nearly 30 years with only pine trees to munch , the researchers write . ( a historian thinks a $ 500 million treasure hides in an old nazi bunker . )
