hailey glassman 's two-part insider interview began last night , and she cried about putting " her entire life on hold " ( including college ) for jon gosselin . " i ca n't do this anymore , i ca n't take it , " she said , adding that she 's told jon " if you really loved me , you would let me go , " but he has begged her to stay . he 's even threatened suicide if glassman leaves him , ex-nanny stephanie santoro tells radar . jon , of course , responded to the insider with a statement , thanking hailey for her " emotional support " and asking the world at large for an " opportunity to prove myself . " the best news of all comes from star , with the seemingly inevitable revelation that this whole mess will be turned into a movie , courtesy of new line cinema . " ideally they 'd like cameron diaz for kate and johnny depp for jon , " says a perhaps naively optimistic source .
