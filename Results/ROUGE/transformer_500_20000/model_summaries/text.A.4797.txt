a former police employee skirted murder and manslaughter charges in texas this week when a jury sided with his so-called " gay panic " defense , the houston chronicle reports . james miller , 69 , testified that in 2015 he was at the house of neighbor david spencer , 32 , drinking and jamming on their instruments when the younger man tried to kiss him . " we were playing back and forth and everything , and i just let him know—hey , i 'm not gay , " miller says in an affidavit , per kxan . " then it seemed like everything was all right , and everything was fine . when i got ready to go—it seemed like [ expletive ] just started happening . " miller apparently pulled a knife , stabbed spencer twice , and showed up at a police station in the wee hours saying " i think i killed someone . ... i stabbed him . " in his defense , miller said spencer was bigger and stronger and might hurt him . prosecutors argued that spencer did n't threaten or injure his neighbor , but on tuesday an austin jury rejected murder charges and found miller guilty of criminally negligent homicide , sentencing him to 6 months in jail with 100 hours of community service and $ 10,000 in fines . now lgbt advocates are speaking up against " gay panic " defenses , which are legal in every state except california and illinois . " it 's hard to believe that something like this exists , " the executive director of the lgbt bar association tells the washington post . " this is something from the very darkest of ages , based on the idea that if a gay guy hits on a straight guy , then the straight guy gets to do whatever he wants to do to him , including a homicide . " ( this story has been updated : we originally reported miller was an ex-cop ; he was a civilian employee of the austin pd . )
