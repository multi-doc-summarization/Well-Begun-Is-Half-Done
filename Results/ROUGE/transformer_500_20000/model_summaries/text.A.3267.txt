" i feel an incredible sense of relief , " grimm said in a statement tuesday . " after fighting this policy since i was 15 years old , i finally have a court decision saying that what the gloucester county school board did to me was wrong and it was against the law . i was determined not to give up because i did n't want any other student to have to suffer the same experience that i had to go through .
