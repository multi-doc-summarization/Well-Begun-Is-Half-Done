amtrak is taking its lumps after a twitter misfire . in response to a woman 's tweet about being stuck in an amtrak elevator at baltimore-washington international airport , amtrak tweeted on wednesday , " we are sorry to hear that . are you still in the elevator ? " well , no . amanda carpenter 's plea for help had actually gone out seven months earlier , and amtrak failed to notice the elapsed time . carpenter , who is ted cruz 's former communications director , responded , " oh , my thank you for this but i was trapped months ago . like last february . thanks for checking ... ? ha . " the gaffe has brought all kinds of ridicule and memes down upon amtrak , as rounded up by mashable . " not our finest hour , " acknowledged the company in a followup tweet . it seems that carpenter 's original tweet resurfaced all these months later because somebody retweeted it for some reason , and whoever responded on behalf of amtrak simply did n't see the date . in fairness to the company , it responded to the original tweet just 16 minutes after carpenter sent the request for help , telling her that " bwi agents are aware of you , and are working to get you out . " amtrak has now offered carpenter a free train ride over the mess , but that did n't stop twitter users from poking fun at what one guy calls " the worst customer service response time ever . " another used a gif of a skeleton holding a telephone .
