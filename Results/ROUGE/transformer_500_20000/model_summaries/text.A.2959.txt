a woman wearing nude-colored flats , a finding dory tank top , and cutoff jean shorts was kicked out of a mall in michigan on saturday for breaking dress codeâ€”even though it was 90 degrees outside . so hannah pewee took to facebook to share her version of what happened at woodland mall in grand rapids , and her story got noticed , with thousands of shares and likes and hundreds of comments , mostly coming to her defense . " apparently some anonymous person reported me to mall security for inappropriate dress and i was kicked out , " she writes . " never mind that within a one foot radius there were plenty of girls dressed just like me , since it 's ninety degrees outside . " she described herself as shaking and on the verge of tears . mashable calls it " another day , another woman scolded for wearing clothes . " pewee , who people reports studies at grand state university , says she was enjoying the afternoon at the mall with her sister when she was told to leave . in a sunday facebook post she wrote that mall management called her to apologize and will be revising woodland 's dress code , which at the time vaguely stated , " appropriate attire , including shirts and shoes , is required . " in a comment on her post , woodland mall apologized , writing , " we dropped the ball on this one , " and adding that it never intend to shame or embarrass anyone . indeed , " slut-shaming how girls are dressed is deplorable and outdated , and it needs to stop , " wrote pewee , who hopes " some good " can come out of her much-publicized experience . ( these girls were n't allowed to board a plane because they were wearing leggings . )
