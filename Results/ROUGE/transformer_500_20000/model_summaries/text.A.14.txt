the wall street journal today takes a look at the life and death of 94 little words : the heavily edited and ultimately faulty benghazi talking points compiled by the cia in the wake of the consulate attack . just a day after the attack , the cia 's reports were already referencing al-qaeda in the islamic mahgreb . the following day , david petraeus appeared before house and senate groups ; he , too , mentioned the terrorists , and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that congress could use . by noon on sept. 14 , a draft was circulating—and it referenced al-qaeda . but an exhausting process of editing followed , with more than two dozen cia officials weighing in on the copy over email—and battling about the inclusion of al-qaeda . those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky ( sourced from intercepted phone calls ) and over fears it could alert al-qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched . the opponents won out , though the term " extremists " remained ; the fbi agreed with the call . it also contained this line : " the demonstrations in benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the us embassy in cairo . " on sept. 15 , the cia station chief in tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring . he sent the cia an email summarizing his thoughts the next day—but susan rice had already been hand-delivered the 94 fateful words the night before , so that she could prep for her news show appearances . click for the journal 's full take , which charts the ultimate change in the cia 's assessment .
