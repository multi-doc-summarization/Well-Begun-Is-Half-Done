for the last four decades , cobalt mining has been almost non-existent in the us . that 's changing now with what the bbc labels a rush for the precious metal recently named as critical to the us economy . with increases in price and demand for the silver-blue mineral—used in everything from the lithium-ion batteries to jet engines to drones—mining firms that have " never actually gone looking for cobalt " are doing so , says trent mell , ceo of canada-based first cobalt . his is one of several firms planning to dig for cobalt in the us , including in idaho and missouri , over the next several years . along with the risks—there 's availability and price volatility to consider , not to mention the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to establish a mine—comes the potential for big rewards . consumption of cobalt—selling for $ 32 a pound , up from $ 20 in early 2011—is on pace to rise 8 % to 10 % a year , per the bbc . indeed , some analysts expect to see shortages as soon as 2022 . american-mined cobalt could ease the burden and might even fetch a premium price as the us looks to ease its reliance on imports and more companies begin to request ethical sources of the metal . abc australia reports that more than 60 % of the world 's supply comes from the democratic republic of congo , where amnesty international claims child slaves toil in mines . some , however , see the rush as coming too late . tiberius group ceo christoph eibl tells bloomberg that " the craziness that you see in cobalt will in many ways actually be corrected . " for example , future batteries may use less lithium , he says . " there ’ s so much uncertainty about how future technologies will be applied . "
