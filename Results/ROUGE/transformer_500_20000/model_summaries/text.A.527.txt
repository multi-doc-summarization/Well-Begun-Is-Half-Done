there 's waking up hungry and there 's , well , this . a british cafe has introduced the queen of all breakfasts , a 59-item spread that packs in 7,778 calories . the corner cafe 's monster mega breakfast comes across as slightly redundant : it contains eggs and omelets , fried potatoes ( four portions ) and hash browns , and both toast and fried bread . plus bacon , sausages , mushrooms , chips , onion rings , black pudding , tomatoes , and beans . the meal costs about $ 22.50 and has a time limit attached : those attempting to polish it off have an hour to do so if they want to win a place on the wall of champions , a breakfast coupon , and a key ring . they 'll be helped ( or hindered ? ) along the way with one of two drinks : their choice of a milkshake or energy drink , reports the bristol post . a manager of the portishead cafe tells the post that since being launched earlier this month , five people have ordered it and none have finished . quirky side note : no one under 18 is allowed to order it . the cafe 's facebook page has photos of those who have made the attempt , along with a message to those who have accused it of being wasteful . its post begins , " we are just a little family run business who ca n't save the entire world from famine and starvation ! " could the 8,000-calorie breakfast be the start of a trend ? the bear grills cafe in congleton , england , made a splash a few months ago with the launch of its own 8,000-calorie meal , the 7-pound " hibernator . " sweet tooths may prefer its version , which includes four waffles . more on it here .
