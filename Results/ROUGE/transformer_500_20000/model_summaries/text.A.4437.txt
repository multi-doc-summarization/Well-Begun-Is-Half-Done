pope francis was merely praying in a video that some claim shows him performing an exorcism on a mexican pilgrim , the vatican says . in the video—broadcast on a tv station owned by the italian bishops ' conference—the man convulses and then goes limp after the stern-faced pontiff places his hands on his head , the bbc reports . exorcists say that no matter what the vatican claims , the pope was clearly expelling the forces of evil from the man . " the pope is also the bishop of rome , and like any bishop he is also an exorcist , " says father gabriele amorth , the vatican 's former chief exorcist . " it was a real exorcism , " he says , claiming that the pilgrim was possessed by no fewer than four demons . the pope 's frequent references to satan have fueled suspicion that the incident was an exorcism , but a vatican spokesman says it was at most a " prayer for liberation , " the ap notes .
