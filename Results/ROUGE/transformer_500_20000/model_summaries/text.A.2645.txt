the social media platform tsu.co has garnered more than 4 million users since its 2013 inception , but facebook would have you believe it simply does n't exist . since late september , facebook has blocked ( and retroactively deleted 10 million ) mentions of and links to tsu.co from any of its platforms , including instagram and messenger , reports the new york daily news . " you can post pornhub links on facebook , but not tsu.co , " tsu founder sebastian sobczak says . and while he claims that the reason for the block is having a model that is " dangerous to them , " facebook rep melanie ensign says it all boils down to user experience : " we do not allow developers to incentivize content sharing on our platform because it encourages spammy sharing and creates a bad experience for people on facebook . " while facebook keeps all profits from ad revenue , tsu keeps just 10 % ; the remaining 90 % is shared between users who 've created content and the chain of friends who invited said user . cnnmoney has spoken to a dozen tsu.co users , most of them artists and models who have yet to make any money on the site , but they overwhelmingly agree that facebook 's block is unfair . " i do n't believe that facebook and instagram want tsu to go viral , " one user from colombia says . " it would cost them a lot of money . " after posting a link to a tsu.co video on facebook , for instance , 50 cent had his mention removed as well , reports the ap . facebook , meanwhile , says it will lift the block if tsu no longer allows its users to post simultaneously to tsu and facebook . for now , mention tsu.co and you 'll likely be met with this error : " the content you 're trying to share includes a link that our security systems detected to be unsafe . " ( this model recently quit social media altogether . )
