it turns out there were even more reasons the centers for medicare and medicaid services should n't have picked the free-wheeling and allegedly shady cgi federal to build healthcare.gov . when cgi was vetted back in 2007 , it did n't have any obvious black marks on its record , the washington post explains . but cgi is a " roll-up " company formed by acquiring other companies—one of which , american management systems , was one giant black mark . ams projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level , including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits . the company went $ 60 million over budget on that one , yet produced nothing useful . more than 100 ams alumni are now cgi executives or consultants . " should cms have recognized that ‘ ok , here ’ s cgi federal . it ’ s a new company , but , oh , my god , it looks a lot like the ams from yesterday ’ ? " asked one ex-cms official . " yes . i would consider that dropping the ball . " but it did n't come up in 2007 , and cms never re-vetted the company , the post 's review of internal documents reveals . on the bright side , the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free , made purely because officials considered cms ' bid " technically superior . " vanity fair , meanwhile , has an in-depth piece today on what many suspect is an accounting scandal brewing at cgi . it looks a lot like the company is using its acquisitions to mask financial problems , a quasi-legal practice known as creating a " cookie jar .
