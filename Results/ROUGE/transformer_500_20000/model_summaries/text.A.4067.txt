leonardo dicaprio is the new cover boy for rolling stone , and the magazine has snippets of its interview : dating : " i had better success meeting girls before titanic . my interactions with them did n't have all the stigma behind it , not to mention there wasn ’ t a perception of her talking to me for only one reason . " growing up : " i was essentially a dwarf with the biggest mouth in the world . i would talk back to anyone and be up for any fight . " nerves : " ( my stomach churns over ) really stupid stuff . things that should n't make you anxious whatsoever . it 's crazy how your mind will become this database to make you worry about things that are so arbitrary . " wilder days : " i got to be wild and nuts , and i did n't suffer as much as people do now , where they have to play it so safe that they ruin their credibility . " drugs : " my two main competitors in the beginning , the blond-haired kids i went to audition with , one hung himself and the other died of a heroin overdose ... . i was never into drugs at all . there aren ’ t stories of me in a pool of my own vomit in a hotel room on the hollywood strip . " ( radar says he 's speaking of jonathan brandis and river phoenix . )
