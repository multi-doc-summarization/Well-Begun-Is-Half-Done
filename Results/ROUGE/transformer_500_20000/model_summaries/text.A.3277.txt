john travolta 's latest leading role is n't going over too well with qantas airline 's crew . the actor , clad in a pilot 's uniform , opens the airline 's three-minute safety video , announcing , " this is your captain speakingâ€”well , maybe not today . " ( click here to watch the video . ) he continues , " but i can guarantee that the guys on the flight deck and the greater team care just as much about aircraft safety as i do . i 've been flying over 40 years as a pilot and i can tell you , there 's no one i 'd rather have at the controls than a qantas pilot . " among the crew 's complaints , as reported by australia 's daily telegraph : referring to flight attendants as " the team : " says one , " we feel it 's demeaning . it makes us feel like we work at mcdonald 's . " considering the recent safety issues , the tone is too light : " the whole thing seems to make the safety message seem trite . " travolta was n't the right choice : some staff felt captain richard de crespigny , who was at the helm of the failed flight from singapore , would have been the better pick . " who better than the genuine aviation professionals who saved qf32 ? " it 's just plain lame : or " corny , " " tacky , " and " cringeworthy . " a qantas rep called the video " engaging " and said all feedback had been positive .
