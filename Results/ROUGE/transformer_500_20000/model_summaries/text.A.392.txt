if anything , the land in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone left largely untouched since the chernobyl disaster of 1986 is cheap . after all , studies suggest it wo n't be inhabitable until the year 4986 , reported mcclatchy dc in april , and pretty much nothing can be harvested from it . but now ostap semerak , ukraine 's environment minister , is drumming up foreign interest in solar power projects across the wasteland , which he says is uniquely , if a bit ironically , suited to renewables , reports bloomberg . pv magazine reports that igor gramotkin , today the general director of the chernobyl plant , in april pointed out that " land and transmission line connection " are the most expensive elements of a solar undertaking . lucky then , that " we already have high-voltage transmission lines that were previously used for the nuclear stations , " says semerak . " and we have many people trained to work at power plants " ( thousands still work at chernobyl ) . plus there 's all that inexpensive land . ukraine 's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with kremlin-backed rebels near the russian border , not to mention increasing friction with the putin camp over natural gas bills . semerak says four energy companies from canada and two investment firms from the us have expressed interest in a solar complex at the chernobyl site , while ukrainian developers intend to install panels there before 2016 is through . ( apparently human habitation is worse for wildlife than radiation , according to this exclusion-zone activity . )
