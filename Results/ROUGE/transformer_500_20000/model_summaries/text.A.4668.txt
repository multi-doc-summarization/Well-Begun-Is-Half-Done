our very primitive beginnings look to have been very primitive indeed . it turns out the earliest known ancestor of humans was a sea creature a millimeter in size that likely lacked an anus . in a study published in nature on monday , scientists named saccorhytus coronaries as a 540 million-year-old member—at that age the oldest one—of a category of animals called deuterostomes . the bbc explains deuterostomes gave rise to vertebrates . " all deuterostomes had a common ancestor , and we think that is what we are looking at here , " researcher simon conway morris tells the bbc . as for what they 're looking at , " the bag-like body bears a prominent mouth and associated folds , " the researchers write . live science reports the deuterostome groups scientists have previously discovered were at most 520 million years old , and had begun evolving into vertebrates , echinoderms ( ie , starfish ) , and hemichordates ( acorn worms ) . that left scientists stumped as to what a common ancestor would have looked like . now they say they know . " we had to process enormous volumes of limestone—about [ 3 tons ] —to get to the fossils , but a steady stream of new finds allowed us to " answer that question , says co-author jian han of the find , made in china . two other details , from a cambridge press release : the minuscule creature is thought to have lived between grains of sand on the sea bed , and it featured small conical structures that the water it ingested may have exited through " and so were perhaps the evolutionary precursor of the gills we now see in fish . " ( scientists have found earth 's oldest civilization . )
