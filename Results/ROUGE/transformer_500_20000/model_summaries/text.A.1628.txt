gigantic gemstones do n't typically emerge out of canadian mines like they do in south africa , but a big find in the northwest territories has just smashed that stereotype . bloomberg reports a 552-carat yellow diamond the size of a chicken egg ( picture here ) was found there in october , and it 's now said to be the largest diamond ever unearthed in north america . the " astonishing gemstone " was discovered at the diavik mine , owned by the rio tinto group and dominion diamond mines , about 135 miles south of the arctic circle , per a press release . in addition to its north american honors , the diamond , which measures 33.74mm by 54.56mm , would rank among the 30 biggest stones ever discovered , per bloomberg estimates , as well as the seventh largest this century . the scratches on the diamond indicate it had a " difficult journey , " and that it remained intact during the recovery process is " remarkable , " the release notes . also noteworthy is the fact that it came out of a mine in canada , which is known for having tough terrain to penetrate due to the sub-arctic conditions and dearth of access . " it 's very unusual for a diamond of this size in this part of the world , " dominion chief executive officer shane durgin tells bloomberg . he adds that it 's hard to say yet how much the diamond will ultimately be worth ; it needs to be seen how it ends up once it 's cut . dominion will select a partner to do that job , and polish the stone to finish it off , in the next few weeks . ( a 163-carat white diamond went for $ 33.7m last year at auction . )
