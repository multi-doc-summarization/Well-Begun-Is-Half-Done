it 's a 26-year tradition now in meriden , conn. , and one with a somber start : on jan. 2 , 1988 , police found a newborn boy frozen to death outside . he had been wrapped in a blanket , but the full-term baby with blond hair and blue eyes stood no chance in the frigid weather . police took up a collection and paid for his burial , reports wtnh , and members of the local clergy named him david paul . today , as they have on every jan. 2 since then , police and others in the community gathered at the cemetery where the baby is buried . " the meriden police department unofficially adopted this child and cared for this child 's burial , " says a retired detective sergeant , " and we think david paul represents all the children who are abused , neglected , or abandoned . " the local record-journal notes that connecticut has since passed a safe haven law that allows a mother to leave her baby at a hospital within 30 days of birth , no questions asked .
