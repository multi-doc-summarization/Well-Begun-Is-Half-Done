a texas family knew they had a new addition on the way , but they had no way of knowing where the baby girl would make her first appearance : in a chick-fil-a bathroom . per kens5 , robert griffin and his wife were on their way to the hospital in san antonio when they stopped at a chick-fil-a to drop their kids off with a friend in the parking lot . falon griffin was already in labor , but she told her husband she desperately needed to use the restroom . in order to do so , they had to bang on the chick-fil-a door , because it was already closed for the night . employees let them in and , before long , they alerted her husband that something seemed wrong . " the manager said 'she ’ s in the restroom and she ’ s screaming , ' " griffin wrote in a facebook post about the whirlwind delivery . " so there we were ... ..my wife and i in a tiny stall in the bathroom . " as the baby 's head crowned and the delivery showed no signs of slowing down , griffin described how he had to calmly ask his wife to stop pushing for a moment when he realized the umbilical cord was wrapped around the infant 's neck . " i was somehow able to unwrap the ( cord ) from the baby ’ s neck . with two more strong pushes , and using my shirt for a towel , out came gracelyn mae violet griffin , " griffin wrote . as the star-telegram notes , griffin suggested there was also someone else in that bathroom , at least in spirit . “ i think it ’ s pretty ironic that a proud conservative , christian family would have a baby in a chick-fil-a , and wrapped in a trump 2020 t-shirt ! boom # maga , " he wrote . the chain has promised gracelyn free chick-fil-a for life and a job when she turns 16 . ( the company 's politics have stirred up controversy . )
