astronomically inclined conspiracy theorists have long been predicting the earth 's demise in a collision with a rogue planet called " niburu " or " planet x " biding its time out of sight somewhere in the solar system , cnet reports . in fact , niburu was " supposed " to crash into earth just last month . and while death-by-planet remains unlikely , the existence of an undiscovered planet in our solar system is now almost a certainty , according to nasa . planetary astrophysicist konstantin batygin and professor mike brown set out to disprove the existence of a hidden planet a few years ago and , ironically , ended up finding convincing evidence for the existence of what they call " planet nine . " the main evidence for planet nine comes from its " gravitational footprint , " but it 's convincing enough that batygin says the solar system makes a lot more sense with the hidden planet than without it , space.com reports . planet nine is believed to be 10 times more massive than earth and located about 20 times farther from the sun than neptune . from its position in the far reaches of the solar system , it has tilted and reversed the orbits of objects in the kuiper belt , according to batygin and brown . it also may be the reason the orbits of the planets are slightly off from the sun 's equator . finally , planet nine could be the " super earth " frequently found orbiting other stars but " conspicuously absent " around ours . oh , and nasa wants conspiracy theorists to know planet nine , if it exists , is staying far away from earth . ( scientists just found the smallest possible star . )
