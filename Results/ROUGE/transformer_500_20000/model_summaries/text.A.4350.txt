all public schools in nashua , nh , will be closed monday after what superintendent mark conrad describes as a " detailed threat of violence to harm students and staff " at both of the city 's high schools . the school district made 14,000 automated phone calls sunday evening to inform parents of the closure , wmur reports . " i regret any difficulties this creates for working parents but safety must remain our first priority , " conrad , who expects schools to reopen on tuesday , said in a statement . gov . maggie hassan says state officials are working closely with nashua police and the fbi , per wmur . " we are really working from the perspective of caution , " the superintendent tells the new hampshire union leader , adding that police are doing a " great job " in trying to determine where the threat came from and whether it 's credible . he says the amount of detail in the threat , which was received by a school administrator , is " especially concerning . " it 's not clear whether the new hampshire threat is linked to those that were received by school districts across the country and shut down all los angeles-area schools for a day last week . those threats have been traced to an email service that does n't keep any information on users .
