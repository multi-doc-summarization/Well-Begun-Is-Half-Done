promising new research may make it possible to detect autism in babies before symptoms appear . researchers scanned the brains of infants with autistic siblings considered at high risk of developing the disorder themselves . they report in the journal nature that brain changes identified in mris of infants allowed them to predict with 80 % accuracy in the first year which ones would go to show autistic symptoms . children usually do not show signs of autistic spectrum disorder ( asd ) , such as not making eye contact , until age 2 or older . early intervention has been shown to ease and even reverse symptoms . lead author joseph piven tells cbs news " the first year of life ( is ) where the brain is most malleable " and responsive to treatment . though small in scope , the first-ever study could lead to development of a tool to predict autism in high-risk infants—and perhaps in the general population—before their first birthday " to prevent these children from falling behind in social and communication skills , " co-author annette estes tells the guardian . one in 100 children develop autism , but that risk zooms to one in five for those with an autistic sibling , per nature . scientists analyzed the brain scans of 106 babies at high risk and 42 at low risk for the disorder . those in the high-risk group who later went on to develop asd saw unusual growth of the outer surface of the brains in the first year of life , followed by " an overgrowth of the brain " in the second year , piven tells cbs . that brain growth was linked to asd symptoms .
