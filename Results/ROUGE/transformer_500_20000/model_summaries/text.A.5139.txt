one of the most talked-about cocktails this week is the trendy moscow mule , but for all the wrong reasons . you can thank iowa . the spate of headlines was kicked off by an official state health advisory warning that the drink , usually served in a copper mug , poses a health risk if the wrong kind of mug is used . for the uninitiated , a moscow mule has vodka , ginger beer , and lime , and thus is acidic , explains live science . the problem is , you 're not supposed to serve acidic beverages in mugs with a copper interior because it raises the risk of copper leaching into the drink . solution ? a mug with a copper exterior is fine , but make sure the interior is made of stainless steel , nickel , or some other alternative . the advice is n't new , but the state felt compelled to issue the advisory given the " recent popularity of moscow mules . " ( a cruise through instagram proves the point . ) iowa 's warning is based on an fda advisory from a few years ago . specifically , it says that drinks with a ph level of 6.0 or under should not be served in pure copper mugs , and the mule falls into that category . for the record , so do fruit juices , vinegar , and wine , notes the daily news . ( some might prefer a little food poisoning to this cocktail ingredient . )
