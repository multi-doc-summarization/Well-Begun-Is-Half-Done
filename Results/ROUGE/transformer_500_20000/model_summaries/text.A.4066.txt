fresh off winning a rotating seat on the 15-member un security council , saudi arabia has made the unexpected move of refusing it , citing the body 's poor response to unrest in the middle east , specifically in syria . in a statement reported by the new york times , the saudi foreign ministry argues " the method and work mechanism and the double standards in the security council prevent it from properly shouldering its responsibilities toward world peace , " noting the country will only take its place once reforms have been made to boost the body 's role in fostering that peace . it did n't give specifics . though the times suggests that saudi arabia is frustrated that permanent members russia and china have stymied some of the west 's efforts regarding syria ( efforts the country supports ) , reuters reports that much of the country 's anger is directed at the us . it specifies that saudi arabia views american policies regarding the arab spring as damaging relations between the two countries ; washington 's softening toward iran 's new president , hasan rouhani , has n't sat well with the country , either . the times calls it a " surprising " move , noting that it was the first time saudi arabia has gone after a security council seat , which many saw as an indication that it wanted to have a bigger hand in what 's happening in syria .
