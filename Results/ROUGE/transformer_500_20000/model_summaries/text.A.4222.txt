the unemployment rate ticked down from 5.9 % to 5.8 % last month , its lowest level since july 2008 , the ap reports . and 214,000 jobs were added ; 233,000 had been expected , per the wall street journal 's forecast , with the unemployment rate expected to stick at 5.9 % . august and september numbers were also revised upward : august saw 203,000 new jobs added ( up from 180,000 ) , and september saw 256,000 ( up from 248,000 ) . that means the economy has added 200,000 or more jobs per month for nine consecutive months , the longest stretch since 1995 , the ap notes . even though the new jobs number for october does n't look great when compared to what was expected , the ap points out that it extends " the healthiest pace of hiring in eight years . " and michael j. casey at the journal explains why today 's jobs report is actually pretty good news : " unemployment dropped , including in the u-6 broader measure of joblessness . and it came with a higher participation rate . along with the upward revision in the september payrolls number , all of this means the net takeaway ai n't as bad as the headline jobs number suggests .
