when john and jeanette betancourt were alerted friday that their 4-month-old son had been bitten at his san antonio day care , jeanette went to pick him up and noticed the day care operator was holding the infant close to her body . " she finally turns my son around and the first thing my wife notices is his legs , " john betancourt tells the houston chronicle , describing a horrific scene that involved not only bites on the baby 's legs , but also on his eye area , cheeks , stomach , and backâ€”27 bites in all by another child at the day care , kens 5 reports . now the state of texas has shut down the in-home operation , which investigators say is unlicensed and has been in business for eight years , and the incident is being probed by the san antonio pd to see if the operator could face charges . the woman , who was found with eight children in her charge monday when investigators showed up , told jeanette betancourt that although she heard the baby crying , she did n't think anything was wrong , per the paper . on tuesday , the day care operator told kens 5 that she called the parents minutes after realizing the baby had been bitten and that she was n't aware she needed a license , saying , " yesterday i found out . " but the betancourts tell kens 5 that the woman waited four hours to call them ( and only after the baby 's wounds did n't fade ) , and john betancourt tells the chronicle , " when we went to her house to do the initial interview ... she showed us that she had a license " ; he adds he wishes they 'd confirmed that . other parents who 've sent their children to the day care tell kens 5 they never had any issues . the baby , meanwhile , is healing and " doing fine now , " the dad tells the chronicle .
