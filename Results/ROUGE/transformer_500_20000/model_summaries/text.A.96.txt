in 2012 , a marketing research company determined pantone 448 c ( aka " opaque couché " ) was the world 's ugliest color—and it 's been used to try to save lives ever since . per the guardian , gfk surveyed 1,000 smokers back then to find out which hue turned them off the most , and this pantone pick—a greenish-brown blend that survey participants said reminded them of " death " and " tar " —emerged the winner . time notes the agency had been commissioned by the australian government to find a color so repellent it could be used on cigarette packaging to discourage people from lighting up . the new color was found to have the most ability to " minimize appeal " and " maximize perceived harm " and was implemented on plain cigarette packs with health warnings across australia , the brisbane times reported at the time . early results are now in , and it appears the color that cnn describes as " sludge-like " may have made an impact : cigarette sales have fallen , and now other countries such as the uk , france , and ireland are following suit , per metro . so what is it about the color that makes it such an effective sales deterrent ? a color consultant tells cnn it may be the strong resemblance to , well , poop . but not everyone 's on board with trashing opaque couché . pantone sniffs to the guardian , " at the pantone color institute , we consider all colors equally , " noting that the color 's " deep , rich earth tones " make it a oft-chosen pick for sofas . but perhaps the saddest entity of all ? the long-silent pantone 448 c twitter account , which back in 2012 reacted to the news of its denigrated status by tweeting , " i used to feature so much in all your 70s couches , curtains , and wallpapers . what did i do to deserve this ? " ( speaking of ugly , this dating site rejects ugly people . )
