anders behring breivik , the 32-year-old right-wing nationalist suspected of killing at least 92 people in norway on friday , apparently left behind a 1,500-page manifesto and a 12-minute video detailing his bizarre beliefs , reports the new york times . the document , titled “ 2083 : a european declaration of independence ” and posted to the internet hours before the attacks , blasts " multiculturalism " and " marxism " and provides a detailed daily diary of breivik 's preparations in the months leading up to the attacks . both his lawyer and police say he has confessed to the attacks , the ap reports . the manifesto claims that a small group of like-minded militants would “ seize political and military control of western european countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda , " and talks of a london meeting in 2002 to re-form the " knights templar " crusading order . “ the time for dialogue is over . we gave peace a chance . the time for armed resistance has come , " wrote breivik , predicting a war that would kill or hurt more than 1 million people . some analysts say the manifesto bears a striking resemblance to the writings of osama bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders . “ it seems to be an attempt to mirror al-qaeda , " but from a christian rather than muslim viewpoint , says a norwegian terrorism expert .
