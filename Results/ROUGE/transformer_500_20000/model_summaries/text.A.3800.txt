a uk high court judge may have deemed his decision tuesday " the final chapter " in the case of little alfie evans , but alfie 's parents are n't ready to accept that ending . the bbc and guardian report on the court 's ruling that the seriously ill 23-month-old—who suffers from a rare degenerative neurological disorder and who was taken off life support monday—can now return home from alder hey children 's hospital or be placed in hospice , but that his parents , tom evans and kate james , ca n't bring him to a rome hospital for further treatment . although justice anthony hayden described the toddler as " a fighter , resilient , courageous and a warrior , " he does n't think further treatment will make any difference in alfie 's condition and that his parents should take this " special opportunity " to spend time with him , not waste it on what he sees as futile treatment and legal battles . hayden also rejected claims by alfie 's father that the boy was doing " significantly better " after alfie was said to have breathed without machinery for 20 hours after being taken off life support . " the brain can not regenerate itself and there is virtually nothing of his brain left , " hayden argued . alfie 's parents are appealing hayden 's decision and tell the bbc they have an appointment at the appeals court set for wednesday . they 'd like alfie to receive care at bambino gesu hospital , which has ties to the vatican . " i 'm not giving up because alfie is breathing away , " evans says . " he is not suffering , he is not struggling ; he is fighting . " both pope francis and italian authorities have supported the family 's desire to bring alfie to rome , with the pope saying " only god can decide who dies , " per cbs news . ( alfie 's case is reminiscent of that of baby charlie gard , who died last summer . )
