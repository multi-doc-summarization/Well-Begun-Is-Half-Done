" her talk received the most raucous and frequent ovations of the entire conference , the guardian reports . she saved some of her folksy ( or is it kitschy ? ) ire for the gop , calling on the party to embrace a populist vision : " now is the time to furlough the consultants , and tune out the pollsters , send the focus groups home , and toss the political scripts , " she said . and she speared new conservative super pacs designed to weed out more conservative candidates for more electable ones . her talk had humor , too : she sipped a big gulp in a clear jab at new york 's anti-soda campaign , and tossed off a line regarding her christmas gift for husband todd : " he 's got the rifle , i 've got the rack .
