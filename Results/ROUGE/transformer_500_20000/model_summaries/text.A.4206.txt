" these results add to prior evidence of a potentially detrimental relation of rotating night shift work and health and longevity , " the lead researcher says . rotating shift work is defined as working at least three nights a month in addition to working day and evening shifts . and while the researchers acknowledge that more study is needed to learn how a person 's individual traits might play a role , people who work rotating night shifts for more than five years do experience an 11 % hike in risk of death from all causes , reports healthday news .
