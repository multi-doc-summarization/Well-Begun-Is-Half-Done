the discovery of 12 thai boys and their coach still alive after 10 days trapped in a flooded cave has brought massive relief to their families and an anxious nationâ€”but the military warns that their ordeal could be only just beginning . the group , discovered by two british divers late monday , are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave , and the thai military says it could be months before it can get them out , unless the boys learn to dive , the bbc reports . the cave in northern thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in september or october , meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months . experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys , ages 11 to 16 , to safety through miles of dark , narrow , flooded tunnels . " trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible , even if the dives are relatively easy , " us national cave rescue commission coordinator anmar mirza tells the ap . thai officials say they 're committed to " 100 % safety " and will continue to explore their options , including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route . officials say the boys are hungry and weak but in stable medical condition with only minor injuries . they have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come .
