maybe the final , happy note in the tiger mom brouhaha ? amy chua 's daughter was valedictorian of her high school class , reports the daily caller . sophia chua-rubenfeld even poked a little fun at the controversy over mom 's battle hymn of the tiger mother book , joking that she was going to read from it rather than give her own speech . if you missed the fury in january , critics read the book as an indictment of america 's lax parenting and as a push for an Ã¼ber-strict alternative . author chua said they took what was meant to be a humorous , self-deprecating book way too seriously . either way , things have worked out nicely for sophia , who is apparently on her way to harvard . her blog is here .
