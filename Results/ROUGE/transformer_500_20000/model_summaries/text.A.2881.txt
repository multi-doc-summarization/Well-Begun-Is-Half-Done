" these are so delicate and breakable that if you check your violin , it will get broken , " pine tells kob 4 . " there 's no maybe it will get broken . it definitely will get broken . " american ticket agents got her on another flight , violin and all , and the airline says in a statement that it " has reached out to ms. barton directly to apologize for the inconvenience . " she has the violin courtesy of a lifetime loan from an anonymous patron . last year , pine spent the night in a phoenix airport terminal after a similar disagreement with us airways , notes a post at violinist.com . in a far more serious incident , back in 1995 , the 1617 amati violin pine was carrying got trapped in a metra train door ; she was secured to it by its strap and dragged more than 300 feet . she was able to free herself , but the train 's wheels took her left leg and mangled her right .
