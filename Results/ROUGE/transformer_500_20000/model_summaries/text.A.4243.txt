a former professor who taught one barry obama at harvard law school now says his onetime student " must be defeated in the coming election . " roberto unger—who , the daily mail reports , actually advised obama during his 2008 campaign—believes obama " has failed to advance the progressive cause , " he says in a youtube video from last month that got little notice until now . unger at one point launches into what the daily caller refers to as " a series of one-liners against obama , " though he also criticizes the republican party . " he has spent trillions of dollars to rescue the moneyed interests and left workers and homeowners to their own devices , " says unger , who is also a well-known brazilian politician . " he has subordinated the broadening of economic and educational opportunity to the important but secondary issue of access to health care . … his policy is financial confidence and food stamps . he has evoked a politics of hand-holding . " after reiterating that obama must be defeated , unger concludes , " only a political reversal can allow the voice of democratic prophecy to speak once again in american life . "
