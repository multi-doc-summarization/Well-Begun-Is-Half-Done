' " that 's lori jones describing her reaction to her post-surgery discovery that her navel was no more . hoping to don a two-piece bathing suit this summer , the 45-year-old houston woman in december underwent the removal of an umbilical hernia and had a tummy tuck to get rid of her c-section-related " baby pooch , " ktrk reports . a month later it was time to remove the surgical tape . jones , " thinking my belly button is there , " found out that it was not . and she has questions for renowned plastic surgeon younan nowzardan , who performed the surgery : " what happened to it ? did you throw it in the trash ? " nowzardan , however , tells ktrk he informed jones that , because of a preexisting scar , the belly button was going to go . " we can call hollywood and get an oscar nomination for her , " he says , adding that he can go back in and give jones a new belly button . but jones says she has contacted an attorney and wants to settle the issue in court . her displeasure notwithstanding , jones is not alone in being belly-button-less . fashion model karolina kurkova , for instance , is lacking a navel because of a surgery she had as an infant , the new york daily news noted when this odd fact made headlines a few years ago . the bbc also looked into the issue , explaining that in addition to surgery , another factor sometimes at play is a " lotus birth " —in which the umbilical cord and placenta are left to drop off on their own .
