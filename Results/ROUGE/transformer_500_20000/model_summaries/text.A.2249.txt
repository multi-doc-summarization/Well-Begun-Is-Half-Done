on jan. 23 , 2013 , less than three months before the boston marathon bombings , tamerlan tsarnaev was ready to reinvent himself . he applied that day to change his first name to " muaz , " in honor of a rebel from russia 's dagestan republic who was killed by russian forces in 2009 . muaz was also the nickname bestowed upon tsarnaev when he visited dagestan in 2012 , officials say . the previously unreleased name change application was recently obtained from the department of homeland security by the los angeles times . the reason tsarnaev gave for changing his name , according to an official who spoke to the times : " he said , 'the russian people have been terrorizing my home country for all these years . ' this is why he needed to come back to america and help . " this detail , and others that are emerging , paint the elder tsarnaev as more radical than he was originally believed to beâ€”and defense attorneys for younger brother dzhokhar are likely to use that picture in court , to argue that tamerlan was the leader and coerced his brother to participate . dzhokhar 's lawyers have argued that tamerlan may have become increasingly " distressed " after the fbi interviewed him about the trip to dagestan , possibly believing the bureau was pressuring him " to be an informant , reporting on the chechen and muslim community , " the boston globe reported last month .
