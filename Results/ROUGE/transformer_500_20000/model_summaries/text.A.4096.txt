amazon is n't just expanding grocery deliveries : the company will soon offer a shipping service for businesses , putting it in direct competition with ups and fedex , whose shares saw sharp declines in pre-market trading friday , per cnbc . " shipping with amazon " will see amazon pick up packages from third-party merchants who sell on amazon 's website before shipping them to buyers at lower rates than offered by ups and fedexâ€”though amazon may have to use those companies to reach areas beyond its delivery network , sources familiar with the plan tell the wall street journal . the service is expected to debut within weeks in los angeles , where a pilot program has been in the works for more than a year . the service could be expanded to more cities , possibly this year . " we 're always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices , " a spokeswoman says , without offering specifics , though the journal notes " shipping with amazon " could eventually be offered to other businesses , too . sources say amazon will be able to undercut ups and fedex because it already delivers some of its own orders in 37 cities . " any extra space it can fill in its trucks with additional deliveries is considered added revenue , " the journal reports , noting amazon eventually hopes to offer two-day deliveries , even on weekends .
