bill and kirsten bresnan are off to an early valentine 's day start—they 've been sharing holiday-themed cards since feb. 1 . but that 's not even close to the whole story . bill has penned a love note to his wife nearly every day since 1974 . bresnan tells the asbury park press that " kris " was initially a student of his in a six-week prep class for the series 7 exam ; when they started commuting on the same long island railroad train , he began by jotting notes to her on napkins . it grew from there to , by today 's count , 10,000 letters , organized chronologically in some 25 boxes . the couple , who say they 've never had a fight in all those years and prefer to talk it out instead of argue , call the collection their " love diary . " the signature of each letter bears an infinity sign . some of the notes are short and sweet— " thank you for being you and loving me , " scribbled on a postcard in december 1989—but sometimes bill goes big , reports abc news . in the 50 days leading up to kris ' 50th birthday , for instance , he sent a series of 50 special cards . but in the end , bill says , the key is to focus on and treasure each other , not phones and other distractions ; he says dinner each night is eaten by candlelight , with romantic music as a backdrop . as for this valentine 's day , " we 'll probably have a nice dinner , a special bottle of wine , and a piece of chocolate , " he says . " we 're past the craving for jewelry and expensive nonsense . we just enjoy simply being together . " as for his letter-writing habit , he expresses a single qualm to cbs new york : " as i get older , my biggest fear is the day i forget to give it to her . " ( one couple 's love letters from wwi were recently uncovered . )
