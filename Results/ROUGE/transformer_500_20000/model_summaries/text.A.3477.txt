is mike tyson actually turning into a comedian ? first there was his roast appearance and now this : he ’ s been cast as herman cain in funny or die ’ s new election season parody series “ live funny or die . " the series launched last week with a video featuring most of the candidates—including darrell hammond as rick perry and infamous obama impersonator reggie brown as the president , according to the hollywood reporter . but it ’ s this video , a full blast of tyson , that ’ s got us in stitches . in a perfect marriage of actor and material , tyson ’ s cain explains his rise in the polls thusly : “ the tea party loves crazy more than they hate black. ” he then lays out campaign promises like “ i ’ m gon na wear a flag pin the size of a fat baby ’ s head and show off the cool handshake jesus and i have been working on , ” pausing occasionally to randomly shout “ cain ! ” it must be seen to be believed .
