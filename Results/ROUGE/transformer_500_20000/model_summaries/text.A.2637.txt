everybody 's talking about the possibility of oprah running for president , but the man currently in office does n't think it will happen . " i do n't think she 's going to run , " president trump told reporters tuesday , per cbs news . if she did , however , trump said he 'd win . " i 'd beat oprah , " he said , before adding that he liked her and once appeared on her show with his family . " it was very nice . " trump does indeed apparently like oprah , as cnn recounts . he told larry king back in 1999 that she 'd be the ideal running mate were he ever to run for president . " she 's popular , she 's brilliant , she 's a wonderful woman , " he said . " it would be a pretty good ticket . " more recently , in 2012 , he tweeted that " i adore oprah . " ( plenty of columnists have weighed in on why she should n't run . )
