starting next week , you 'll be able to nosh on a croissant-donut hybrid if you live near a dunkin ' donuts—but do n't call the delectable dessert a cronut . the chain says that starting nov. 3 , it will churn out a limited run of its " croissant donut , " which some are already comparing to the now-trademarked cronut treat first made famous by new york city 's dominique ansel bakery , the ap reports . the new offering will have the same glaze as dunkin 's glazed donut , wo n't have filling ( for now ) , and will sell for $ 2.49—more than twice what the chain 's regular donuts go for , making it more profitable for a company that 's seen flagging sales , the ap notes . dd wo n't cop to any cronut copycat crime , though . " are we copying a specific bakery in new york ? the answer is no , " dunkin 's president of global marketing and innovation says . so what 's the difference between the actual cronut—which comes with a caveat on dominique ansel 's website that the " creation is not to be mistaken as simply croissant dough that has been fried " —and dd 's version ? dunkin 's executive chef tells the ap , " i 've tried the product that you mention . as the executive chef of dunkin ' , i like ours better . " others might agree : the owner of a rival nyc bakery tells the new yorker that dominique ansel makes a " lousy croissant " anyway . ( election time 's coming—if you like dunkin ' donuts , you might be a republican . )
