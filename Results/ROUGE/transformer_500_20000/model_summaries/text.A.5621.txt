" stop the madness ! ! ! ! , " " dear lord , " and " i want to die " were just a few of the responses to what was meant to be a routine email friday about a seasonal potluck party in a utah state office , per the miami herald . what caused the holiday hubbub : the email meant for one department was accidentally sent to more than 25,000 employees throughout the state , leading to what newsweek calls " a cascade of curt , angry , and confused responses " when recipients started hitting " reply all " in their return correspondence , kutv reports . unable to simply ignore the mass email , hordes of workers , both irritated and amused , tried to get off the " reply all " chain by â€¦ replying to all with that request , which newsweek notes " only deepened the communication quicksand . " " it 's replyall-gate 2018 . adventures in state government , " one worker tweeted as it was happening , while another worried the messages would n't taper off : " i fear this will never end . " in addition to the snark and outrage , some replies were genuine queries about what to bring to the potluck , as well as to the white-elephant gift exchange also set to take place . a utah communications professional offers some advice to those who want to avoid the same " reply all " fiasco happening when they have their own email to send out . " prevention is key : send large group emails to yourself w/ bcc to other recipients , and hope somebody does n't 'loop ' others in , " he tweeted . neither the person who sent the email , nor the department , had been ided by eod friday .
