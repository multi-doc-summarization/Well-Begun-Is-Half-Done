if president trump thinks the iran nuclear deal should be scrapped , the ayatollah seems happy to oblige . " if the us tears up the deal , we will shred it , " supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said tuesday in a speech to students , per reuters . he was referring to president trump 's decision last week not to recertify the deal struck under the obama administration . trump 's move does n't mean the us is withdrawingâ€”instead he essentially turned that decision over to congress . in his own speech , khamenei unleashed a torrent of criticism against trump . " i do n't want to waste our time to respond to the rants and whoppers of the foul-throated president of the united states , " the guardian quotes him as saying . ( translations differ slightly in various accounts . ) " everyone should know that once again america will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by the people of iran . " the ap 's account has the ayatollah referring to the trump administration as " mentally retarded . " other nations are part of the nuclear accord , but khamenei suggested that a us withdrawal would effectively kill it . and he seemed to be urging other parties , especially in europe , to stand up to the us . " european states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned trump , " he said , per the hill . " we welcomed this , but it is not enough to ask trump not to rip up the agreement . europe needs to stand against practical measures ( taken ) by america . " the next big move may be up to congress , which has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions that were lifted by the agreement .
