" thank you . thank you . " those were the first words gregory jean jr. spoke to police on saturday when they peeled back a wood panel in an upstairs closet and found him crammed in the space between the garage and attic , wxia reports . but the officers had help from gregory himself , because it was the texts and photos he sent to his mom that helped police track down where the missing 13-year-old was hidden in his father and stepmother 's house , the ap reports . and although gregory jean sr. , 37 , and samantha joy davis , 42 , did n't bar police from searching the home , " there was a lot of deception , " clayton county police sgt . joanne southerland told reporters , as per cnn . in fact , the first officers on the scene—sent after a 911 call from the boy 's mother—came up empty-handed and left after jean and davis said they knew nothing . after the police left , young gregory contacted his mom again through the magicjack app and she redialed 911 ; when southerland , who had worked in a crimes against children unit for several years , heard that call , she made police go back and search again . " we were n't going to leave until we found him , " she tells wxia . the space gregory was crammed into had nothing but wooden beams and insulation— " a space where no person should be living , " the local police chief told reporters . the next court appearance for jean and davis , who have been charged with false imprisonment , child cruelty , and obstruction of justice , is scheduled for dec. 9 , the atlanta journal-constitution reports .
