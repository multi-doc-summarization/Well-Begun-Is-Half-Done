newt gingrich got more airtime than usual in last night 's national security-focused republican debate , and most pundits agree that his performance was good enough to win over plenty of undecided voters . " gingrich showed that he has been thinking about these issues for decades , " writes corbett b. daly at cbs news . jon huntsman showed his competence , and mitt romney did well despite turning in one of his weakest debate performances so far , while herman cain and rick perry floundered , he writes . gingrich showed that he 's a skilled debater , but " his refusal to back away from his belief that we shouldn â€™ t throw out all 11 million people here illegally could come back to bite him in a party that is vehemently opposed to anything that looks or sounds like amnesty , " notes chris cillizza at the washington post . gingrich 's " snappy comebacks and ferocious defenses of tough security positions " will have impressed many gop voters , but his argument for immigration reform will make the debate " a double-edged sword " for him , concludes molly ball at the atlantic . his history of moderation on immigration might serve him well in a general election , but it wo n't do him any favors in the republican primaries , she writes . romney " made no real miscues , " but he had " no breakout moments at a debate that was about an issue where he is supposed to be far ahead of the field , " notes maggie haberman at politico . michele bachmann " made her points clearly and succinctly , and seemed like she belonged on the stage , " and while ron paul performed strongly " within his predictable boundaries : fewer wars , less government intrusion , and less aid to foreign nations , " he did nothing to show that he can broaden his support , she writes .
