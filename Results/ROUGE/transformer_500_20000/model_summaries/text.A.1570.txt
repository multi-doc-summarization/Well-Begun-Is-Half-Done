the death of prince has opened up an ugly feud between sinead o'connor and arsenio hall that is now in the courts . in a facebook post monday , the irish singer accused hall— " aka prince 's and eddie murphy 's bitch " —of supplying prince with hard drugs over many years , adding that she had reported him to authorities and that " anyone " who thought prince " was not a long time hard drug user is living in cloud cuckoo land . " in a later post , she accused hall of spiking her with drugs at murphy 's house . hall fired back with a $ 5 million lawsuit filed in los angeles thursday , accusing o'connor of telling " despicable , fabricated lies " in a bid for attention , cnn reports . " hall will not stand idly by while o'connor attempts to get attention for herself by recklessly spreading malicious , vile lies that he engaged in egregious criminal conduct which falsely links hall to prince 's death , " the lawsuit states . hall denies ever supplying drugs to prince and says he has had no contact with o'connor for 25 years . tmz reports that hall says o'connor , whose biggest hit was a cover of prince 's " nothing compares 2 u , " only met the star a couple of times , and she " detested " him .
