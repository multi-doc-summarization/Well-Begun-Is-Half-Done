the drawn-out saga involving the lawsuits against trump university gained a new wrinkle with a new york times probe that reveals students who took his real estate classes were coerced into giving their instructors positive reviews—with those reviews perhaps serving as " a central component of a business model … that deceived consumers into handing over thousands of dollars with tantalizing promises of riches , " as the paper puts it . a review of hundreds of legal files , plus interviews with ex-students and instructors , suggests pressure to make those reviews sing , in addition to what the paper calls " unusual practices , " such as not clearly offering anonymity on the forms and requesting the surveys in exchange for graduation certificates . why this revelation could be critical : the glowing reviews have , as of late , served as trump 's main ammunition against the claims of fraud . he has referred to the surveys as " beautiful statements " that show a 98 % level of satisfaction . there 's even a website with thousands of positive evaluations to back him up . but ex-students say their praise came only under duress . " i finally gave in , " says one former student who initially gave his teacher a bad score but changed it after a trump u employee kept badgering him with phone calls . another says an assigned " mentor " stood over him as he filled out his form , while a third says he was guilted into rating his teacher highly because the teacher basically begged him to . " it 's absolutely a con , " that ex-student , 76 , says . a trump lawyer says it 's " completely implausible to suggest that the 10,000 reviews from the students and their guests were the result of pressure or coercion . " the last rating by the bbb in 2010 , meanwhile , gave trump u a d-minus , per the hill .
