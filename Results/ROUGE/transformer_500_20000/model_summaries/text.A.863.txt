" for whatever reason , they decided xavier davis was the guy . " that from the lawyer for 31-year-old davis , arrested in january as the suspect in a sexual assault in grand rapids , mich . the problem : dna evidence and uber and phone records showed davis was n't the guy , and charges against him were dropped in july , per mlive.com . before that , though , he was in prison for 129 days , then attached to an e-tether for two months , and now he 's suing the city of grand rapids and three cops for false imprisonment and defamation , among other allegations , per wood . " i 'm telling them , 'you have the wrong person , ' " davis says of his arrest , which he says was based on a sketch that does n't even look like him ; wzzm has a picture of it . it gets a bit complicated : davis was already under investigation for a burglary and arson when he was arrested for the rape of a woman in her car in late december . at his january arraignment , davis—who was sent to prison for more than a year in 2012 for a home invasion and also has been convicted of window peeping—was then charged with another sexual assault at his workplace , though his lawyer says he started working there after the assault report . in both cases , davis contends police led the victims to believe he was their attacker , and that even after the dna and other evidence started to surface in february showing he was n't in the car case , he was still incarcerated for months . he also says his face and name were plastered everywhere after his arrest , and he lost his two jobs and was evicted from his home after he got out of jail , per wood . he said he told cops during his initial questioning : " you guys are gon na be sued after this if you do n't fix this . " charges in both cases were dropped , and wood notes davis has since secured a new job and place to live . ( cops hope dna will lead them to the zodiac killer . )
