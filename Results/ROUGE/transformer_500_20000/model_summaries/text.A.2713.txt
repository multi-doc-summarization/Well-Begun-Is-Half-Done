us intelligence has determined that isis likely has the ability to produce fake syrian passports , reports abc news . the network cites a 17-page homeland security investigations intelligence report that states isis probably has at its disposal both a passport-printing machine and blank passport books ; there 's some additional fear that isis is n't being blocked from government buildings that house syrian identification records that could be put to nefarious use , reports cnn . reuters spoke with a rep for us immigration and customs enforcement who confirmed the report 's existence . this alleged ability is apparently not a new one , per the report , as isis seized deir ez-zour , which is home to a passport office , last summer . " since more than 17 months [ have ] passed since raqqa and deir ez-zour fell to isis , it is possible that individuals from syria with passports ‘ issued ’ in these isis controlled cities or who had passport blanks , may have traveled to the us , " per the report . the information was labeled as coming from a source who was assigned a " moderate confidence " rating , the second-highest level available . that source added that " fake syrian passports are so prevalent in syria that syrians do not even view possessing them as illegal " ; they reportedly cost as little as $ 200 . ( stolen passports are turning up , too . )
