" not since before roe v. wade has a law or court decision had the potential to devastate away from an abortion provider , " said nancy northrop , president and ceo of the center for reproductive rights . texas will be able to start enforcing the restrictions in about three weeks unless the supreme court steps in and temporarily halts the decision , said stephanie toti , an attorney for the center . only seven of which meet the building standards upheld by the court . but the court made an exception for whole woman ’ s health in mcallen , which won ’ t be required to meet all of the building requirements or gain admitting privileges for one doctor .
