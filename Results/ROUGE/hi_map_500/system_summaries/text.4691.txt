a new genetic blood test might pave the way for detecting early stage cancers that can detect cancer dna in the blood of patients with late-stage tumors , the ap reports . the test scans blood for dna fragments released by cancerous tumors , explained lead researcher dr. victor velculescu , co-director at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center , whose study was published in the journal science translational medicine . in making the test , the test detected stage 1 or 2 colon , breast , lung or ovarian cancers between 59 percent and 71 percent of the time when assessing 200 patients previously diagnosed with cancer , researchers found . " to our knowledge , this is one of the first studies that has looked directly at early-stage cancers , " says reuters . " if we are able to detect cancer earlier , our chances of saving lives . " the blood test detects many early stage in more than half of 138 patients with the disease , the bbc reports . researchers say the scans has been used to identify cancers at a stage when patients have a better chance at survival . the challenge was to identify rare dna for healthy people , said velculescu .
