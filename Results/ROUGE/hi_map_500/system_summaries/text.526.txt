william hanlon 's patented beheading block is not nearly as deadly as it sounds , but a new study finds that the body of the head of the body has been used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment during a point removed from its natural position , both in distance and angle , and all this without the employment of a blow , the guardian reports . " the object of this invention is to produce upon the stage in the presence of an audience and under full light an illusive beheading so nearly realistic that as the victim 's head lies upon the block the descending ax and block give forth the neck of the victim , and the blade appears to actually sever the natural thud of reflectors , such as are commonly used for illusive acts of this general character , " says a rep for the study . " we found a combination of 8 compounds in 2004 , one from the field with full bodies has to corroborate these results and even develop machines that could do the same job . researchers have been trying to release a singular chemical cocktail , one that scientists might be able to use to better train cadaver dogs .
