a man claiming to have had a one-night with christine o'donnell three years ago , the new york daily news reports . " if it was any politician whose private life diverged from his public life in such an interesting way , we 'd be interested in that , " he says , per the bbc . " we 'd met for the first and only time three months earlier when my two roommates and i signed the lease on our apartment : christine 's aunt owned the place we were moving into , and she happened to be up from delaware visiting at the time . but we 'd only spent about five minutes together that day and we had n't spoken the real issues in this election . anybody that says there is n't a double standard for how the media treats women versus men running for office is n't living in reality . over at the upshot , michael calderone spoke with gawker editor remy stern , who defended the piece as " misogyny and disgusting and once again not showcasing much , and i had n't thought it was a great story .
