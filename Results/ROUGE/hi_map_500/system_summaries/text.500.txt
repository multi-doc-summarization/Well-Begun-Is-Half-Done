woods shot 76 in the second round to go along with thursday 's 80 to finish 16-over par , reports usa today . the first round of the memorial tournament earlier this month , those of us still holding onto tiger confidence and tiger hope are going to give it up in short order . tiger opened with an 80 in the first <unk> at chambers bay , and the look on his face was a familiar one when he topped his 3-wood and saw it roll up the fairway and into the hazard . the look was familiar because when i play with my buddies bobbo , junior ( aka muscles ) and ron , i often see that look on their faces when i do it . bobbo is always the one with the quick remark . when i hit that same expression on my face when they hit a worm burner up the hill , he slipped and fell on his backside before needing two putts to make bogey . on his first nine holes , he shot 2-over-par 36 . but he was n't even close as the top 60 and ties will make the cut starting on the 10th , woods hit his second shot into hay near the green and had to slash out his third onto the green .
