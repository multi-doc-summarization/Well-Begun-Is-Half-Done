the white house on sunday said the addition of president trump 's chief strategist , steve bannon , to regular meetings of the country 's top national security officials was essential to the commander in chief 's decision-making process . trump said his director of national intelligence and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff would attend " where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed . " bannon served in the navy before attending harvard business school , working at goldman sachs , starting his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm and later heading the ultraconservative outlet breitbart news . " he is a former naval officer . he 's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now , " white house press secretary sean spicer told abc 's " this week . " spicer said " having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings who has a significant military background to help make guide what the president 's final analysis is going to be is crucial . " trump is an illegitimate choice for chief strategist because of breitbart 's tendency to share views many perceive as racist , sexist and anti-semitic , can now regularly attend meetings that deal with policy issues affecting national security . what twitter is saying : since when does the breitbart guy know more about national security than the country. and the cia ? never ! # stoppresidentbannon .
