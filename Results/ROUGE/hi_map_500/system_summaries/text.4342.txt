north korea says it 's ready to deploy and start mass-producing a new medium-range missile capable of reaching japan and major u.s. military bases there following a test launch it claims confirmed the missile 's combat readiness and is an " answer " to president trump 's policies . " our military is closely monitoring signs for additional provocation by the north korean military and we are keeping a full military readiness , " said a statement from seoul 's joint chiefs of staff . the launch was north korea â€™ s second in a week and south korea 's media said more missiles will be launched in the future . trump , traveling in saudi arabia , had no immediate public comment . north korean leader kim jong un said on monday it successfully tested what it called an intermediate-range ballistic missile , which met all technical requirements and could now be mass-produced , although u.s. officials and experts questioned the extent of the relatively new solid-fuel type after so few tests . the missile , described by washington as medium-range , was fired from pukchang in south pyongan province and traveled about 310 miles , according to the south 's armed forces . the test did not demonstrate a new capability , or one that could threaten the united states directly .
