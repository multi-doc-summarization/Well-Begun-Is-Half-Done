president trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser , jared kushner , had his white house security clearance restored wednesday , a person familiar with the matter said , after months of uncertainty stemming in part from his role in the ongoing investigation by special counsel robert mueller . kushner met with mueller 's investigators a second time in april and answered questions for seven hours , according to his attorney , abbe lowell . he had previously sat for an interview last november that was largely focused on former national security adviser michael flynn , who soon after pleaded guilty to charges of making false statements to the fbi . these developments come on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the white house . even some inside the administration suspected that mr. kushner 's delay reflected legal problems on the horizon and the palestinians that former diplomats said can be valuable in negotiations . top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level white house meetings . white house officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts .
