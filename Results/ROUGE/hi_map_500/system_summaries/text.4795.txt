cognitive scientist lars chittka felt a bit eclipsed by his colleagues at queen mary university of london , reports the new york times . " so there was a challenge for me : could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher ? " he recalls . the study is the first to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills , and the study notes that the bumblebee brain is puny , and at least compared with the massive and fatty organ locked in your skull . the intelligence of sesame-brained bugs should not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward , notes the wall street journal . chittka 's team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward , but they can also learn this trick from other bees , even though they have no experience with such a task in nature . at about 0.0002 , takes bee smarts in terms of size alone , however , thus indicating that the majority of highly experienced individuals may no longer require visual feedback to perform the necessary sequence of motor actions .
