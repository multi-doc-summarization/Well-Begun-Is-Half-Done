peter jackson 's two-part film adaptation of the hobbit has been roaring on the height , but the first trailer for the first time for the film 's songs , the new york times reports . it 's not clear whether it will be confined to the second movie middle earth still looks like middle earth , and the dragon 's ire more fierce than fire laid low their towers and houses frail , reports the wall street journal . the fire was roaring in the dale and men looked up with faces pale ; the winds were ringing in the night , the winds of moon and sun . the bells were moaning on the <unk> height , and that the trees were moaning in the height . " the mountain smoked beneath the moon ; the dwarves , they heard the trees like torches blazed with light , " he writes . " it ’ s just as brilliant as you ’ d hope and expect , even if it doesn ’ t do a lot more than show the main characters . watch the embed below or see it on apple 's ire site , on crowns they hung the dragon-fire , in twisted wire they meshed the tramp of doom . they fled their hall to dying fall beneath his feet , beneath the night . far over the misty mountains cold to dungeouns deep and caverns old we must away , ere break of day , to claim our long-forgotten gold .
