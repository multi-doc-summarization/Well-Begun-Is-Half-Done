president bashar al-assad 's arms supplier is the only way to respond to the syrian government used poison gas in its civil war , reports the new york times . syria , syria , and britain 's prime minister , david cameron , show how eager the world is to avoid a military showdown when removing the chemical weapons storage sites under international control , but also to their subsequent destruction. , the russian foreign minister says . " if the establishment of international control over chemical weapons in the country will prevent attacks , then we will immediately begin work with damascus , " lavrov said in a statement . " and we call on the syrian leadership to not only agree to setting the us weapons storage . but doran had a very different take : that this is a dishonest ploy by russia and syria that boxes in the unites states and , more importantly , makes any relief for syria 's civil war far less likely . doran made his case against the obama administration 's push for limited strikes against syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons . even if you think that obama should pursue russia 's proposal , i reacted , like many , with highly cautious optimism that this could offer a small but significant reprieve for syrians and success for obama .
