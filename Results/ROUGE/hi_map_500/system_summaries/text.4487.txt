the british study of a pill for alzheimer 's remains a long way off , the study reports . the compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases , which shuts down the production of essential proteins , leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off , reports the bbc . " it 's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease , is a first in itselfâ€¦ we can go forward and develop better molecules and i ca n't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice . i think this probably will translate into other mammalian , " says a study . " the fact that this is a compound that can be given orally , that gets into the brain and prevents brain diseases , " he says , per the independent . the study says it 's a real step forward , but scientists say they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases . they also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease . other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein , whose structure is folded the wrong way . but this research , published in the journal science translational medicine , was carried out at the medical research council 's ( mrc ) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres .
