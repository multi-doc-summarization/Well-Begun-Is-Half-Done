a new research study from indiana university has been accepted for publication in the journal computers in human behavior , reports the bbc . " when writing romantic emails , senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages , but that may not be true , particularly among millennials , " says john t. wells , who 's more arousing physiological tasks . " the bottom line is that email is much better when you want to convey some information that you want someone to think about , " one of the authors says , per the new york times . " we used a lab experiment to investigate the influence of media ( email and voicemail ) on both the psychophysiological responses of senders and the content of the resulting messages . " dennis and wells found that people who sent romantic emails were more emotionally aroused and used stronger and more thoughtful language than those who left voicemails . the research , however , is expected to be more effective in finding love if she asked him to send her an email . the study also notes that the research is " a more intimate way to connect with others .
