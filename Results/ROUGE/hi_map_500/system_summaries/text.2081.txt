mccarthy 's lean prose has been lifted off the printed page and laid carefully into the soundtrack like antique china in a packing crate , reports the bbc . " the movie takes place in an america that has been turned into an ash heap , with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders , " says the narrator of the toronto film festival . " not because anything 's been badly done , but because there 's a serious imbalance in the complicated equation between what the film forces us to endure and what we end up receiving in return.given that it 's based on oct. 27 in chicago . i wrote a draft of a review at the time and sent it . that review accidentally found its way into sight in october , long before the film was scheduled to open . i yanked it offline as quickly as i could . i saw the movie a second time at a press to the coast before a man who 's been there , it 's no surprise that the film is for the most part profoundly depressing.what is disappointing is that despite numerous strong areas , including fine acting by viggo mortensen and young kodi smit-mcphee as father-and-son survivors of an unnamed apocalypse , what we 've been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile .
