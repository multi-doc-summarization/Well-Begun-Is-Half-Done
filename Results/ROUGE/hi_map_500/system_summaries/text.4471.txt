nearly a million jars of peanut butter are being dumped at a new mexico landfill to expedite the sale of a bankrupt peanut-processing plant that was at the heart of a 2012 salmonella outbreak and nationwide recall . bankruptcy trustee clarke coll said he had no other choice after costco wholesale refused to take shipment of valencia peanuts owned by costco and had been sitting in the warehouse since the company shut down and filed for bankruptcy last fall . after extensive testing , costco agreed to a court order authorizing the peanut butter . but after getting eight loads , costco rejected it as " not merchantable " because of leaky peanut oil . coll said " all parties agreed there 's nothing wrong with the sunland butter from a health and safety issue , " but court records show that on a march 19 conference call costco said " it would not agree to any disposition ... other than destruction . " the auction will continue at 10 a.m. court in albuquerque . golden boy â€™ s $ 25 million offer will serve as the opening bid . judge david thuma will consider final approval of the sunland inc. product and declined requests to let it be donated to food banks or repackaged or sold to brokers like prisons . " we considered all options , " coll said .
