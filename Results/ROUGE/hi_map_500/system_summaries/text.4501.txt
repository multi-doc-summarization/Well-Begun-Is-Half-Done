pastor marrion has been called the " oskar schindler of congo , " a man who 's helped save and nurture hundreds of lives in a country where war has claimed millions . pastor marrion p'udongo , who 's been called a " oskar " schindler , says he 's " a call saying that a dear friend had suffered severe kidney failure and was n't expected to live , " per the new york daily news . " he 's gone into the bush to coax out child soldiers , helped scores of rape victims secure medical treatment , fed and into the homes of people who â€™ d been raped and assaulted . and as a result , the world is more informed about this chronically underreported of congo . " pastor marrion says he has " no longer " in the democratic republic of the congo , but he says he 'll have a " call saying " that he 's not the " schindler of the most complex conflicts on earth , even before the defeat of the m23 rebel movement , perhaps the conflict 's most powerful combatant , in late 2013 . although there are more than 1.6 million people displaced , along with frequent fighting between the congolese government and the region 's constellation of armed groups , the conflict often defies a label as straightforward .
