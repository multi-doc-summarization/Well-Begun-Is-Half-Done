it 's not a little sheepish , but it 's " a bad choice of words on my part ... that word has an association with of course dictatorships in the 20th century like germany and spain , and italy . what i know is that we no longer have free enterprise capitalism in health care , it ’ s more like fascism . in fascism , the government doesn ’ t own the means of production , but they do control it , and that ’ s what ’ s happening with our healthcare programs and these reforms. , " writes john mackey at the new york daily news . " the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people 's money . instead , we should be trying to result in unprecedented new taxes and inflation , or they will bankrupt us . while we clearly need health-care reform , the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system . these deficits are simply not sustainable .
