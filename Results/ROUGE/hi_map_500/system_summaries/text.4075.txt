rush limbaugh responded to a couple of my email questions on air about why he 's now urging listeners to call congress over health care legislation . the last time limbaugh gave out the capitol 's switchboard number on air , he said , was when steve roberts was writing a profile of him in the 1990 's for u.s. news & world report . limbaugh said that roberts " was of the belief -- like so many people believed back then . i do n't use my show for activism . i said , 'if i did it , i would shut the place down . so i 'm the one that does n't do it . " limbaugh said he did n't remember what the issue was about , but to prove his point , he gave out . " and he asked me why i did this , " limbaugh recalled . " i do it 's i was doing was giving out the number of activism . " the country has the largest talk radio audience in the country , limbaugh typically does n't use his show to mobilize listeners for coordinated political action .
