paul ryan pulled the republican obamacare replacement plan from the house floor on friday , reports the new york daily news . the bill was pulled that he was " 10 to 15 votes " shy of victory , a stunning margin considering how much effort he and ryan had put into their lobbying campaign during the last week . ryan also knew that the bill had been bleeding votes all day and were not close to passing the bill to save them from having to vote on major legislation and fulfill a seven-year republican promise to repeal obamacare . the speaker went to the white house and told trump as much just an hour earlier . republicans were begging in their opposition , and conservative outside groups despised the bill from the start . and while gop leaders had called trump " the ulimate closer , he was n't able to move many votes , especially among hard-line conservatives in the house freedom caucus , " he said . " it 's a lot of people who have to do so , " says a republican leadership aide , per the times . " the bill is that ryan and his leadership team decided they can , in fact , live with obamacare , at least for now . "
