lena dunham is proud of her body , but the girls actress penned an empowering instagram post thanking glamour magazine for not photoshopping them , reports the new york daily news . " you ’ re definitely like a carrie , but with , like , some samantha aspects , and charlotte hair , " the actress says . " no matter how weird or new things are to us at first—ankle-revealing dresses ? the right to vote ? lady gaga ? —we eventually just absorb them , like drops in a stream , until memory fades and they join up with the continually flowing river that is progress . which is why it ’ s kind of hard to remember that five years ago , when girls premiered on hbo , the world was a different place . sure , rabbit teeth , knock knees - i could never seem to get it right and it haunted my every move . i posed as the sassy confident one , secretly horrified and hurt by careless comments and hostility . this show would be different . girls is fiction , obviously . but it has been committed to portraying life , for the most part , as it is .
