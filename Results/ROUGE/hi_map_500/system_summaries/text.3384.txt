a facebook report claims that lol is now one of the least popular ways to express laughter on the social network . why ? probably because of mom , the waning popularity of lol correlates with aging demographics . in other words , only old people are using lol these days , presumably because it was popular in the internet ’ s early days but is now falling out fashion as emoji becomes the universal language of youths . however , variations of people on facebook have abandoned lol , and those who do use lol are older . is this because old people like your mom think it ’ s still cool or can ’ t figure out how to find the emoji keyboard or maybe it 's because your mom thinks lol stands for “ lots of love , ” the facebook post reports . " lol has fallen out of fashion—but one thing is for sure : lolers are getting older as emoji takes over . rest in peace lol . long live 😂 . [ facebook via gizmodo uk ] to consider the emoji use of expressions like lol or even haha , but the data doesn ’ t lie . "
