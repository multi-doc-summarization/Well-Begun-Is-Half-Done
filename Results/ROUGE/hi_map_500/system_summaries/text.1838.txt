" the correct inquiry here is what an average class member would have understood the notice to guarantee ... and the actions of the class members , " he said . " reading the notice as a whole and in context , we conclude that it promised only one opportunity to opt . " simpson had wanted to opt with real estate gurus , leading to the loss of thousands of dollars in tuition .
