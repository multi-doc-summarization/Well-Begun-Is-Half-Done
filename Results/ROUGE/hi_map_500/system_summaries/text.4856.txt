vice president pence cast a tie-breaking senate vote thursday to pass legislation that will allow states to withhold federal funds from planned parenthood and other health care providers that perform abortions , the ap reports . pence 's vote was needed to break a 50-50 tie . republicans susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska broke with their party , voting against the measure . the measure , a priority for groups that oppose abortion , would give a thumbs-up to tennessee and other conservative states to resume policies blocking planned parenthood from getting federal funding through the title x family-planning program . the house voted its consent last month . the bill erases a regulation imposed by former president obama shortly before he left office that lets states deny family planning funds to organizations only if they are incapable of providing those services . some states have passed laws , and the measure has been tied to the new administration to move legislation . pence delivered the tiebreaking vote on a resolution reversing an obama administration rule that prevented states from withholding family-planning dollars from planned surgery and other clinics that provide abortions . the vice president â€™ s appearance in the senate chamber was needed after two gop senators , alaska 's lisa murkowski and maine 's susan collins , joined democrats opposing the resolution .
