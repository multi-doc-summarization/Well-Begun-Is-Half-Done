scientists have found the first evidence that particles of air pollution traveling through the lungs of pregnant women and into their placentas , potentially reaching their fetuses , cnn reports . " we also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby 's body to have an adverse effect , because if they have an effect on the placenta , this will have a direct impact on the fetus , " the study says . the study notes that air pollution significantly increases the risk of premature birth and of low birth weight , leading to lifelong damage to health . " it is always good if possible to take less polluted routes if you are pregnant â€“ or indeed if they are not pregnant . i avoid busy roads when i walk to the station. , " he said in a statement . " the five pregnant women who took part in the study all lived in london and were scheduled to have planned cesarean section deliveries . all five were non-smokers and gave birth to a healthy baby after uncomplicated pregnancies , " per the new york daily news . " i do n't know whether the particles we found could also move across into the fetus 's body , but our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible , " says a rep for the research team .
