ucla geochemists have found evidence that life likely existed on earth at least 4.1 billion years ago , or about 300 million years earlier than previously thought , according to a team of geochemistry at ucla university and the national academy of sciences . " life on earth may have started almost instantaneously , " says the university of california , los angeles reports . " its complete encasement in crack-free , undisturbed zircon that it is not contamination from more recent geologic processes ... ( and ) may be evidence for the origin of life . " it 's not clear whether the planet formed 4.54 billion years old , give or take 10 million years . " twenty signatures in even older rocks suggest life might have been present 3.8 billion years earlier , " writes mark <unk> at the washington post . " the oldest reliable fossils are about 3.43 billion years . all of these early fossil signatures belong to the large isotopic fractionation associated with enzymatic carbon fixation in later sediments . we report 12 c/ 13 c of graphite preserved in jack hills are isotopically light , and thus potentially biogenic .
