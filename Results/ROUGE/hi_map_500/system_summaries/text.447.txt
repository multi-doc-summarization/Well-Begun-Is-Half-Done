it 's a hashtag campaign , but it 's not clear that the west is n't the only one of the <unk> 's <unk> campaign . the campaign has been razed in social media , powered by a desire to reunite 200 kidnapped nigerian girls with their parents as well as a strong sense of outrage , reports reuters . " if these children had gone missing in spain , whether white or black , there would have been far more coverage , " says a spokesman for the campaign . " it felt good to lend a hand and to know that my contributions made a difference in various campaigns . but i think hashtag activism should be used judiciously , especially when it comes to issues affecting the black community , at home and abroad . in some situations , it risks offering users of social media a false sense of accomplishment while obscuring underlying policy and structural issues as the full picture of what is taking place on the ground . that 's why , after a few tweets , i ceased participating in these internet-based campaigns and have seen the power that lies in we americans when we are aligned to create change from behind our computers .
