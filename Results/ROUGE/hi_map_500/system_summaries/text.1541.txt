al-qaeda has expanded into india , the leader of the terror group said in a video released thursday , vowing that its militants would bring islamic law to the entire subcontinent and " wage jihad against its enemies . " at least three indian states with large muslim populations have been put on alert in the wake of the video 's release , local tv stations reported , though there was no indication of an increased security presence . " this entity was not established today but is the fruit of a blessed effort of more than two years to gather the mujahedeen in the indian sub-continent into a single entity , " al-qaida chief ayman al-zawahri said in the video . al-qaeda is active in afghanistan and pakistan , where its surviving leadership are thought to be hiding out , but zawahiri said the group would take the fight to india , myanmar and bangladesh , per the ap . in a 55-minute video posted online , zawahri also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , in an apparent snub to the islamic state armed group challenging al qaeda for leadership of transnational islamist militancy .
