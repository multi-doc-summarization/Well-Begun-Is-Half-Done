coca-cola is dropping a controversial ingredient from its powerade sports drink , after a similar move by pepsico 's gatorade last year . the ingredient , brominated vegetable oil , had been the target of a petition by a mississippi teenager , who questioned why it was being used in a drink marketed toward health-conscious athletes . the petition on change.org noted that the ingredient is linked to a flame retardant and is not powerade . a couple months ago , i found out that one of my favorite drinks , gatorade ’ s orange , contained brominated vegetable . " it was the last time i drank orange gatorade . i found that if gatorade could do the right thing , so , as i was sitting at home the other day drinking an orange gatorade , i decided to look up some of the ingredients . the last ingredient is " brominated vegetable , " which has been banned in japan and the european union . that means , # 1 it ’ s red fruit punch that is in some gatorade drinks ! who wants to drink that ? not me ! i ’ m naturally a curious and argumentative person doing things like debate team in school . i also love sports like volleyball , and i always believed gatorade when they said stuff in their ads about how it 's good to drink when exercising .
