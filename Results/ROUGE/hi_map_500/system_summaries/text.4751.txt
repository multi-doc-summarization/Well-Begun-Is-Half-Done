the american muslim community was in the wake of the muslim world , but it 's not clear how much of the most american sniper has been in the world . " you are either with us or against us , " says one part of the bush doctrine . " the faked hate narrative that muslim groups and leaders use is now the default talking point any time that jihad or patriotism , for that matter , is being discussed . if muslims spent as much time instituting programs in mosques and islamic centers against jihad recruitment and the jihadic doctrine as they do fighting the myth of islamophobia , the world would be a war in which the us loses or stands down . the left demands that we hang our heads in shame if we triumph . which is a distraction to get people to stop talking jihad and instead address their demands . apparently , muslim groups are claiming that a couple of tweets offended their sensibilities . they want action ! more like submission . it 's called free speech , brutes . why do n't muslim groups demand that leaders of the world , imams , al azhar university , et al denounce the hateful , racist , anti-semitic , misogynist , anti-kuffar language in the qur'an that is responsible for all of these muslim wars across the world ? the idea that the film " glorifies war and sanitizes kyle " is laughable . " it 's a " war talk or war movie that the left enjoys is a vastly safer place . "
