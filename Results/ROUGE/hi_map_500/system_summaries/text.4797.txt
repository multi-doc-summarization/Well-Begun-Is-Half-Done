" the state called a number of witnesses to the stand , including the victim 's mother . " i have a huge hole in my heart . something 's wrong in the world when you lose your child before you go , " miller said . " we were playing back and forth and everything , and i just let him know - hey , i 'm not a gay guy . then it seemed like everything was all right , and everything i 'm tortured by the fact that he suffered and that he was alone when he died . it 's a loss that cuts deeply . " a former cop said he killed a man in september , 2015 , after a night of music and drinking at spencer 's house , miller testified , his younger neighbor made a fatal mistake : he moved in for a kiss .
