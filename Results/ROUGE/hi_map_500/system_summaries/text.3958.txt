republican representative pete sessions said on thursday that he was dropping out of the race for house majority leader , leaving just one candidate in the contest to replace eric cantor . " today , it became obvious to me that the measures necessary to run a successful campaign would have created unnecessary and painful division within our party . at this critical time , we must remain unified as a republican conference . as always , i stand ready and willing to work with our team to advance the conservative agenda that the american people demand and deserve , " sessions said in a statement . " after thoughtful consideration and discussion with my colleagues , i have made the decision to not continue my run for us majority leader . " sessions is the house rules committee chairman and former head of the house gop campaign committee . barring a late , new challenger , mccarthy will become the second-ranking house republican after the leadership election scheduled for june 19 . while sessions began seeking support within minutes of cantor 's surprise loss , he could not overcome the advantage that mccarthy had built up as the party 's chief vote counter and top fund-raiser .
