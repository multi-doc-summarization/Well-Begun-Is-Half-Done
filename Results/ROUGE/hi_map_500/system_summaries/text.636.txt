north korean leader kim jong un has been released from north korea 's secret labor camps , the new york times reports . " i was worried that we were going to be treated to another clownish asian stereotype , " he said . " it did n't seem as if with no homes and no ties , and no knowledge of life outside the gulag , many decided to have dropped in recent years , yet there is no evidence of anyone leaving . and it seemed all but certain that kim , as portrayed by korean-american actor randall park , would fall into the same clownish role we 've seen over and over . and some of them are still there . even some of those who were apparently released 20 years ago never left : others do seem to see something super offensive , that either belittled the plight of the north korean people or turned geopolitics into an excuse for fart on end . " hollywood has had a long track record of producing mystifyingly offensive asian and asian-american caricatures , and russia recently sent the brother of a dissident politician to prison .
