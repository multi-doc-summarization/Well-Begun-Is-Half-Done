sen. reid says romney still is n't coming clean on taxes paul ryan and gop vice presidential nominee paul ryan on friday traded sharp criticism over health care reforms and medicare , with each telling a leading advocacy group for senior citizens that the other was being untruthful . " contrary to what you 've heard and what you may hear from subsequent speakers , obamacare actually strengthened medicare , " he said . " it funnels $ 716 billion out of medicare to pay for a new entitlement that we didn ’ t even ask for , " the candidate says . " the debate over medicare is a major issue in the november election campaign , especially in the vital battleground state of florida with its large population of senior citizens . ryan headed to florida later friday , while obama campaigned in virginia , vice president joe biden spoke to the same event shortly afterward . in particular , he called the claim by ryan and other republicans that the health care law strengthened medicare was " just medicare into a piggy bank for obamacare . " ryan , meanwhile , said that " the first step to a stronger medicare is to repeal obamacare . it weakens medicare for today ’ s seniors and puts it at risk for the next generation. . "
