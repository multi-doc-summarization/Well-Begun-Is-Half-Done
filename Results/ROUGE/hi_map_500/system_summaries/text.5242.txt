the california supreme court on thursday reversed a ruling that ordered improved conditions for elephants at los angeles zoo , a setback for animal advocates who say the city and its zoo director had violated penal code statutes proscribing animal abuse , but it provided them neither the right to a jury trial nor the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt , per the ap . leider ’ s complaint said the keeper had shocked billy and that the animal was bobbing his head . city leaders have recently highlighted conditions at the zoo , with councilman paul koretz calling for the zoo to move an asian elephant named billy to a sanctuary . zoo officials objected , saying that keepers are looking after the elephants . in 2012 , los angeles county superior court judge john segal stopped short of ruling that the zoo ’ s treatment was inhumane but said officials need to take better care of criminal law , so an injunction against the city can not stand , according to the unanimous court . justice carol corrigan corrigan rejected the theory in leider 's taxpayer action : that the alleged criminal mistreatment of the animals was an unlawful use of public money .
