virginia 's legislature hung in limbo after a three-judge panel declined to certify the recount of a key house race , saying that a questionable ballot should be counted in favor of the republican and tying a race that democrats thought they had won by a single vote . " after conceding this seat and their majority , they are now desperately trying to claw both back. , " elias said in a statement , per the bbc . " the republicans themselves had affirmed that this result was accurate yesterday before changing their minds today , " newport news circuit court judge bryant l. sugg said after the panel deliberated for more than two hours . he said that the voter had made another mark to strike out simÂ­onds 's name . officials presiding over the five-hour recount on tuesday had discarded that ballot en route to a historic reversal split between republicans and democrats , ending 17 years of gop dominance and making headlines nationwide . but republicans challenged that decision in court wednesday , saying the ballot in question contained a mark for democrat shelly simonds as well as a 10-vote lead in the 94th district , but the recount uncovered enough additional ballots for simonds to give her a one-vote victory .
