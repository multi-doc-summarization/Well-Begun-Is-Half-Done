patricia heaton is perhaps known for her roles in the sitcoms , but it 's not the only conservative who bashed sandra fluke . the georgetown university law student who advocated in favor of requiring insurance companies to cover contraception , reports the new york daily news , which notes that fox 's support for a missouri stem cell research bill by warning against the evils of human cloning and human egg harvesting for profit . and she 's at it again , this time echoing rush limbaugh in castigating sandra fluke , the nasty remarks would cause advertisers to flee . maybe heaton herself was wary of the backlash . some of her many tweets on oink-gate , i took a screenshot of her twitter stream . here it is : sorry , patricia . you can run away from your words , but you can not hide from them . the internet is forever . she was happy to film a commercial in response to michael j , the ap reports . she 's also an outspoken conservative ( not that rare a breed in hollywood , no matter what fox news ) ) who is n't afraid to dip any of the ideas limbaugh put forward during his rants against fluke .
