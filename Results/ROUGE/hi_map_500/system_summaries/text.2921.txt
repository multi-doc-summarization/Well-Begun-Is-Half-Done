the american humane association , the nonprofit organization charged with monitoring film and tv productions for animal abuse , has systematically hidden animal deaths in the interest of preserving friendly relations with powerful hollywood producers . the deaths of three horses on the set of hbo ’ s horse racing series luck—which was overseen by the aha—are well known ( and probably contributed to luck 's cancellation ) , but the stomach-turning incidents go far beyond luck : the article claimed that a dog suffering from cancer died during the production of failure to launch , and the dozens of sheep and goats that died during a hiatus in the filming of the hobbit : an unexpected journey . the aha , which receives most of its funding from industry groups , excused these and other incidents by saying that they happened off-camera , they don ’ t count . most of baum ’ s sources are anonymous , but in many of the cases reported , they had nothing to do with the animals ' treatment on set , or occurred when the animals were not under our care . for example , the hollywood reporter recently ran a story that distorts the work and record of a respected nonprofit organization that has kept millions of beloved animal actors safe on film and television sets around the world for more than 70 years .
