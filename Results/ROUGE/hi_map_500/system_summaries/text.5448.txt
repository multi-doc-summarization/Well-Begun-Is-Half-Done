europe 's experimental mars probe hit the right spot but at the wrong speed â€” likely ending up in a fiery ball of rocket fuel when it struck the surface at high speed , scientists said friday . pictures taken by nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter show a black spot in the area where the schiaparelli lander was meant to touch down wednesday , the european space agency reports . the images end two days of speculation following the probe 's targeted landing zone consistent with a high-velocity impact . schiaparelli is widely thought to have crashed and been destroyed . data transmitted from the probe before it lost contact indicated that its descent systems did not work properly . its parachute was jettisoned too early and its retrorockets , designed to slow the robot to a hover just above the surface , fired only for a few seconds . they should have operated for half a minute . the mro imagery is not quite definitive because the resolution is low - just six metres per pixel . its context has a resolution of 6 mars landing in 2020 , and scientists say the data it sent back before going silent .
