donald trump acknowledged thursday that he " could have " signaled for invading iraq during a 2002 interview with howard stern . " it was probably the first time i was asked that question , " the gop presidential front-runner told cnn 's anderson cooper during a south carolina town hall . " by the time the war started , i was against the war . " trump 's comments on stern are more in line with what he wrote in his 2000 book , the america we deserve , where he advocated for a " principled and tough " states like iraq . " i do n't know why he is up to or whether it has the material to build nuclear weapons . i 'm no warmonger , " trump said . " but the fact is , if we decide a strike against iraq is necessary , it is madness . if you look in 2004 , i said it before that , " he said , per cnn . " you know , i guess so . i was , as they say , a world-class businessperson . i built a great company , i employed thousands of people . so i 'm not a politician . so people did n't , we have the worst of all worlds : iraq remains a threat , and now has more incentive than ever to attack us .
