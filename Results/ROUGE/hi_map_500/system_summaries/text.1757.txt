aviation experts say the slightest defect or micro-crack in a plane window can cause cracks like the one that forced a southwest airlines jet to land in cleveland . a southwest spokeswoman says flight 957 traveling from chicago to new jersey never lost cabin pressure and that the pilots did n't declare an emergency before landing wednesday morning . there were no reports of injuries . airline consultant robert mann says windows are periodically polished to remove the formation of tiny cracks in the acrylic windows from exposure to chemicals and the sun 's rays . he arrived in newark only about an hour and a half behind schedule . anthony roman , a commercial pilot and flight instructor based in new york , says problems with windows should be detected during regular inspections . to deal with the rigors of flight , their curve follows the shape of the fuselage , and their rounded edges make them less susceptible to stress-induced damage . southwest said the damage to the window on wednesday had affected only one layer . jim lee , the founder and chief executive of lee aerospace of wichita , kan. , said plane windows are built to weather that kind of damage .
