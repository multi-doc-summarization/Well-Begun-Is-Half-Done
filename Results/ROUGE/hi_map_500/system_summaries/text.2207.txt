oklahoma 's cities and counties are banned from setting their own minimum wage standards under a bill signed into law monday by gov . mary fallin , the lawyer who wrote the petition , said his coalition is contemplating its next move . " of course we ’ re disappointed that the governor and the republican legislature stood in the way of the law that was signed because we think that it abrogates the people ’ s right to have an initiative petition , " he said . " many are high school or college students living with their parents in middle-class families . " fallin , however , says the petition is " young , single people working part-time or entry-level jobs , " fallin said , per the bbc . " we 're going to explore all options , including the possibility of a statewide initiative . " the petition has been circulating on a petition to support raising the city 's minimum wage from the national standard of $ 7.25 an hour up to $ 10.10 an hour . oklahoma city attorney david slane , who serves as spokesman for the group circulating the law on monday , says he is disappointed that it 's not clear whether the state 's legislature will vote .
