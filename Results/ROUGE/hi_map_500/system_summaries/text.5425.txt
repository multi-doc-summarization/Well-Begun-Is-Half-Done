monkeys ' faces evolved to avoid crossbreeding researchers used human face recognition techniques in the forests of central and west africa , the new york daily news reports . the researchers found that the best evidence to date of visual signs acting as a barrier to breeding across species , the bbc reports . " animals use coloration and patterning for a whole host of different reasons , and we think guenons are using their patterns to recognize different species , " says a spokesman for the university of hull in the journal nature communications and researchers say they are " a group of more than 25 guenon monkey species reveals these sociable animals may be infertile or less healthy , similar to when donkeys and horses breed , allen said . guenons can interbreed in zoos , but the monkeys learn other species ' warning calls like a foreign language , providing protection for all groups . " the researchers also found that guenons ' looks have evolved to become more distinctive from their relatives living close by the monkeys , which could lead to infertile offspring , and spending so much time with other friendly monkeys means running the risk of interbreeding .
