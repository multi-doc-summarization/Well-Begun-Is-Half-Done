the american rock band bon jovi was due to play its first shows in mainland china , with concerts planned in beijing , shanghai , and macau . the band 's namesake singer , jon bon jovi , celebrated the news by recording a famous chinese love song in mandarin , a move that endeared him greatly to fans . however , just a week before the first concert permits have been pulled . bon jovi appears to be the latest american act to run afoul with china 's notoriously opaque ministry of culture , the body that approves or denies performances and releases by musicians and others . one source who works in the chinese music industry says that a video of a 2011 video that showed bon jovi performing in front of images of the dalai lama , along with other important figures , may also have caught the ministry of the tibetan independence movement . sino-british relations were put into the diplomatic deep freeze for more than a video backdrop during a concert five years ago . the abrupt cancellation of two concerts next week in shanghai and shanghai have been cancelled . the chinese government regularly bans artists , academics and maroon 5 , which had its shanghai concert cancelled earlier this year . twitter is also banned in china .
