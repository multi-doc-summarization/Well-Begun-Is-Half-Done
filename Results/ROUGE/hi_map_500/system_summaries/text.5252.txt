the small southern utah town of hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend . the sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for barista 's restaurant , and owner stephen ward said he made it clear to city officials before he altered up friday and decided the bull would look better without the oversized genitalia that caused uproar among the neighbors . hurricane residents disturbed by the noticeable , cone-shaped feature had been running high between ward and the local community just north of the arizona border . customers have said the food is too expensive , alleged that ward is hostile and has poor business practices . he says his offerings are the best in the region and has n't hesitated to community pressure . " i told them i am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints . i do n't like you . i 'm doing it for me , " ward told the spectrum newspaper in st. george ( http ) . " even before the battle over the bull , tensions had asked the bull â€™ s penis removed . "
