britain will ban sales of new gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2040 as part of a bid to clean up the country 's air , reports the bbc . " we ca n't carry on with diesel and petrol cars , " said david bailey secretary michael gove . " there is no alternative to embracing new technology . " the government warned that the move , which will also take in hybrid vehicles , was needed because of the unnecessary and avoidable impact that poor air quality was having on people ’ s health . ministers believe it poses the largest environmental risk to public health in the uk and this government is determined to take strong action in the shortest time possible . " ending diesel and fuel car sales by 2040 is a step in the right direction but given that electric cars are coming anyway this is probably pretty irrelevant , it ’ s a bit like saying we 're banning the sale of steam engines by 2040 , " a government spokesman says , per usa today . the bbc notes that the government has been at the heart of a protracted high court legal battle .
