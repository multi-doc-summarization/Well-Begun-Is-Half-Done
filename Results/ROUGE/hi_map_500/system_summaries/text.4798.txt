a group of caring people wanting to help this family who lost their dog in yellowstone national park on july 23rd , 2015 while vacationing there . jades parents were in a horrible head on collison in the park by a person who fell asleep at the wheel . david suffered multiple injuries and had to be flown out of yellowstone from the crash site for treatment for his numerous injuries at the time of the accident . she is a young , strong dog and has been able to survive somehow against all odds . if you can help with any small donation to the family of jade it will be so much appreciated , if you are going to leave a car in the area in hopes jade will go to it . so many efforts are on daily trying to catch jade in live traps and many other methods that are allowed by the park . so far to no avail , but no one is giving up hope . they have shown over and over again how much they love her by the trips back and forth to the park and sending clothes with their smell .
