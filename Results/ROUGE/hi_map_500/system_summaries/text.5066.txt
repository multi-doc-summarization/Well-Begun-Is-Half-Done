a north augusta mother is behind bars after officers said she left her 9-year-old daughter alone at a park while she went to work , reports the north augusta department of public safety . a woman told officers that a girl had been playing in the park since 9:30 with no adult supervision . the woman says her mother drops her off at the park all the time so she can play while her mother is at work . the girl also told the woman that her mother was and she told her mother dropped her off before going to work . debra lynn harrell , 46 , is charged with unlawful neglect toward a child , and put in jail ; her daughter is now in the custody of the department of social services . most commentatorsâ€”save for a few busybodies interviewed by the local news who nattered on about the possibility of the child alone does n't come close to meeting that threshold . honestly , it seems a bit young to me , but i do n't give birth to the kid , support her , and raise her for 9 years , it is n't my call . 2 ) by arresting this mom ( presumably causing her to lose her job ) and putting the child in foster care , the state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer inside the restaurant for hours on a beautiful summer day .
