the trump administration has reached a deal to put chinese telecommunications company zte corp back in business after it pays a significant fine and makes management changes , a senior congressional aide said on friday . " i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees , change of management and board , must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $ 1.3 billion fine. , " he said , per reuters . the deal involving china 's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker ran into immediate resistance in congress , where democrats and trump 's fellow republicans accused him of bending from beijing to ease up on a company that u.s. intelligence officials have suggested poses a significant risk to u.s. national security . zte was banned in april from buying u.s. technology components for seven years for breaking sanctions against iran and north korea . but what mr. trump may not realize is that zte is also one of the president 's top trade objectives , he should not ease up by the rules in intellectual property ( ip ) matters . to get a sense of just how egregious zte â€™ s behavior truly is , we need only to consult pacer , the national index of federal court cases .
