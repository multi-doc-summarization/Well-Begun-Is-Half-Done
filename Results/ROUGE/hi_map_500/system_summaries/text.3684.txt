the top house and senate democrats said wednesday they had reached agreement with president trump to protect thousands of younger immigrants from deportation and fund some border security enhancements . the deal announced by senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi following a white house dinner would enshrine protections for the nearly 800,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from former president obama 's deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca from deportation . trump ended the program earlier this month and had given congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the statuses of the so-called " dreamers " begin to expire . " we agreed to enshrine the protections of daca into law quickly , and to work out a package of border security , excluding the wall , that 's acceptable to both sides , " pelosi said in a joint statement . it was the second time in two weeks that trump cut out republicans to reach a deal with pelosi and schumer . trump has showed signs of shifting strategy to cross the aisle and work with democrats in the wake of the high-profile failures by republicans to repeal the affordable care act .
