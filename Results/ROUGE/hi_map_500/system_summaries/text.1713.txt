if you follow scientific developments as if they were football games , this would be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems , the new york times reports . " the ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking , new level of clock stability , " he says . " one could say that this is like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds . " in other words , there is no variation in how a second is measured , it would be in about the 18th rate of atomic clocks , the guardian reports . the ytterbium clock ticks in boulder , colorado , and the yellow fiber in the photo of the photo to the age of the universe . " it 's not to be a good time , " says a study for the journal science describing the clock . " we do n't want to be the world 's most precise clock , " the study says . the study notes that the rate of sensors and technology will be in a vacuum chamber , but it 's unclear that the clock could n't be able to work on time .
