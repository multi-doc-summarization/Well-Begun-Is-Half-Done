a new court filing has formally asked a federal judge to cancel her prior to the san bernardino attacks in late 2015 , the ap reports . the justice department has moved to vacate a california court order compelling apple provide aid in an ongoing fbi investigation into the attack . apple had publicly said in court that it would resist all efforts to force its compliance . the move monday ends the legal battle between apple and the fbi in this particular case , but it does n't end the overarching battle about privacy and security . " the government has now successfully accessed the data stored on [ terrorist syed rizwan ] farook ’ s iphone , " says the department of justice said it was evaluating a new method to access the iphone 5c used by syed farook , and it has asked riverside , california-based us magistrate judge sheri pym to vacate less than 24 hours before it was set to take place , because the hearing between prosecutors and apple enforcement agents no longer require help from the iphone maker and can not —or need to —assert the all writs act to force apple 's assistance .
