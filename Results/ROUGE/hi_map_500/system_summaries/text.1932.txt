a member of an opioid-addicted son has been awarded a patent for a treatment for opioid use disorder . dr. richard sackler is listed as one of six inventors on the patent , which was issued in january and was first reported friday by the financial times . critics say the patent could enable sackler to benefit financially from the addiction crisis that his family 's company is accused of fueling . purdue has denied the allegations in the lawsuits , which also target a range of buprenorphine , one of the medications shown to help people with opioid addiction . it is already approved by the food and drug administration in tablet and film form , but the patent describes a wafer that could dissolve even faster than existing forms when put under the tongue . " there ’ s never ‘ i ’ m doing it right. ’ because doing things out of love and hope and belief might be right for an hour , that day or that week , but so quickly the correct thing to be doing could be saying , ‘ you ’ re not welcome in this house. ’ , " roberts tells the toronto international film festival .
