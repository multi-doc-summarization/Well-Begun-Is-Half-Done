a kayaker fishing for salmon off waukegan harbor on monday morning found an unexpected animal in the water , the bbc reports . the city of waukegan , illinois , has been paddling for about four hours when he saw the animal found as a caiman , which is similar to an alligator , but the wildlife discovery center told the city later in the day monday that it was an american alligator . the alligator was transferred to the lake forest wildlife discovery in lake forest , where the alligator looked to be on the thin side from what he has seen so far . he expects the discovery to know within three to five days how serious the situation is , but as long as there aren ’ t any major issues like a bacterial infection , carmichael said . " i was just in shock . i wasn ’ t sure if it was a real alligator or a toy. , " he says . " these creatures are not indigenous . you can imagine the skepticism that came with it , " says the city 's director of public relations . waukegan is about 54 miles south of milwaukee .
