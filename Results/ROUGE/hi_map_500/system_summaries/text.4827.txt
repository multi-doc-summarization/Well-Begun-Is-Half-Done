president trump was apparently eager to forge a friendship with fellow world leader emmanuel macron and his wife , brigitte , to the white house for the trump administration ’ s first state visit . in footage captured by msnbc and later dissected by twitter users , trump appears to make a subtle effort to hold his wife ’ s hand , first extending his pinky finger and then gently giving her hand a little shake before she finally places her . " we have a very special relationship , in fact i 'll get that little piece of dandruff off , " the president says . " seemingly caught off guard at first by the gesture , macron soon smiled and laughed at the interaction . " cnn 's chris cillizza , meanwhile , says it 's not clear whether trump is perfect . " i know i ’ ve been an absentee dad and a horrible husband - including flagrant affairs while you were pregnant - but let ’ s just hold hands at this event , " he said , per the new york times . " it 's all just my way of telling you that thing of when donald-tries-to-hold-melania's-hand-and-she-really-didn't-want-him-to-and-also-a-million-cameras-were-on-them happened . "
