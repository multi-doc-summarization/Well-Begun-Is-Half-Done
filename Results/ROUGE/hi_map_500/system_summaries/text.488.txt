china has suspended imports of shellfish from the west coast of the united states , an unprecedented move that cuts off a $ 270 million northwest industry from its biggest export market . china said it decided to impose the ban after recent shipments of geoduck clams from northwest waters were found by its own government inspectors to have high levels of arsenic and a toxin that causes paralytic shellfish poisoning . the ban is a particularly nettlesome problem in washington because china accounts for about 90 percent of geoduck exports , or psp , in a nov. 21 shipment of geoducks . psp is a biotoxin produced by algae that shellfish eat and , in humans , in high levels it can lead to severe illness and even death . kuow first reported news of the ban . fish inspectors in china notified the u.s. embassy on dec. 3 that china was tentatively in washington or alaska . jerry borchert of the washington department of health said he 's never encountered such a ban based on the chinese government 's assertion that these u.s. safeguards failed to screen out contaminated seafood . “ they ’ ve never done anything like that , where they would not allow shellfish from this entire area based on potentially two areas or maybe just one area . we don ’ t really know yet , " borchert says .
