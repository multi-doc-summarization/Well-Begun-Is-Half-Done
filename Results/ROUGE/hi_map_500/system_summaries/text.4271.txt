the new york times first reported the intended sale of wenner 's 51 percent stake on sunday , reports the bbc . rolling stone editor and publisher jann wenner sold a 50 percent stake in us weekly to the walt disney company for $ 40 million , then borrowed $ 300 million five years later to buy back the stake . the deal prompted three libel lawsuits against rolling stone , one of which led it from investing as much as it might have in its magazines . at the same time , rolling stone suffered a devastating blow to its reputation when it retracted a debunked 2014 article about a gang rape at the university of virginia . a damning report on the story by the columbia graduate school of journalism cited fundamental journalistic failures . the article saddled the company with debt for more than a decade , as well , among them hunter s. thompson , whose " fear and loathing in las vegas " made its debut in damages . " i love my job , i enjoy it , i 've enjoyed it for a long time , " wenner , 71 , tells the times . but selling now is " just the smart thing to do . "
