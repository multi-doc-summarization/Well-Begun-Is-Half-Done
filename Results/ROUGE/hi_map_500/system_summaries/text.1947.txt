saturn 's biggest ring just broke its own record , the new york daily news reports . the study , published in the university of maryland , has found that the planet 's phoebe ring is made mostly of tiny particles , the bbc reports . " i was giving talks saying saturn has a giant invisible ring , which makes you sound just perfectly crazy , " douglas hamilton says . " it is 10 to 20 times larger than the second-biggest ring , so this thing is absolutely gargantuan. . " hamilton was part of the team that discovered the phoebe ring in 2009 , with help from the spitzer space telescope , and it 's not clear whether the ring will collapse and form new satellites . " that does a really good job of explaining rings—except for this one , " says a planetary scientist at the journal nature , which notes that the ring is not only bigger than the researchers thought , it appears to be made of unusually fine particles—particles that continually collide with saturn ’ s moon iapetus as it circles the planet , turning the moon 's leading face black .
