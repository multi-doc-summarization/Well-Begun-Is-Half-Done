the mitt romney campaign circulated a statement monday from its pollster , neil newhouse , conceding the recent shift to obama as " a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions , the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly , " the guardian reports . " some signs point to a tight race : those watching the daily tracking polls know that it ’ s losing and that ohio is slipping out of reach ( ppp ) the 23 million americans struggling to find work , and the 47 million americans who are on food stamps , " newhouse wrote . " we ’ re up with advertising in wisconsin and i think north carolina is going to come off the board . on ohio , they ’ s going to evaporate in september . we feel good about the map . we had a 4-5 point bounce after our convention and it evaporated when they had theirs . now they have a 4-5 bounce . it ’ t get too worked up about the latest polling . " it 's not clear whether the president has seen a bounce from his convention , and he says he 's " not changed . "
