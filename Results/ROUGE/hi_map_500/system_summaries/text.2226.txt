jeb bush took an off-handed jab at women 's health funding and quickly found himself in the middle of a culture clash with hillary clinton , reports cnn . " i was referring to the hard-to-fathom $ 500 million in federal funding that goes to planned parenthood , " he said , adding that " i 'm not sure we need half a billion dollars in funding for women ’ s health programs . " bush 's record on women 's call to cut off funding for planned parenthood and then he went even further , questioning the amount of funding is likely too much . “ i would like to ask him , 'gov , and other women who don ’ t have the access they need , ” he said . “ you provide critical services to all , but particularly low-income women ’ re rural clinics . ” bush , meanwhile , says he ’ s not sure it ’ s a “ billion dollars ” in the case , but he says that “ i ’ m going to be the most of his remark . " he adds that bush ’ s ad is " absolutely , unequivocally wrong . "
