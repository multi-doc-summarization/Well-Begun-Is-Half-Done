a driver who was texting when she hit and killed a 79-year-old new prague man will spend four days in jail after a judge ordered her sentence on monday . a le sueur county judge sentenced 48-year-old susan ann russo for the accident that happened nearly one year ago on oct. 28 , 2015 . the victim , joe tikalsky , was wearing a reflective jacket at the time and was on break from his work as a couple dozen friends and family members of both the late joseph tikalsky and russo . the judge encouraged russo because he hoped she would become a force for change after the " absolute tragic consequence " of her distracted driving . " you are a gifted teacher , use that gift , " judge mark vandelist said . " i knew that was the godlike thing i would be expected to do and we did . we said yes. . " tikalsky , who was married to joe tikalsky for 54 years , said monday was the first time she and her children met with the driver who hit her husband .
