justin timberlake says he 's " the single-handedly most significant person in my life . " justin timberlake , who has been two birds of the same feather small-town kids , has n't spoken to ex , britney spears , and justin timberlake . " why do you think we wind up dating each other , and feeling more comfortable around each other ? we understand what it ’ s like , " he says . " but then you become adults , and the way you were as kids does n't make any sense . i wo n't speak on her , but at least for me , i was a totally different person . i just do n't think we were normal ; there was nothing normal about our existence . we spent way too much time being the biggest thing for teenyboppers . " timberlake , meanwhile , said he 's not spoken to britney spears in a decade ' email . " i think the mistake is that people commit to who that person is right then and not the person they ’ re going to become . that 's the art of staying together , is changing together . "
