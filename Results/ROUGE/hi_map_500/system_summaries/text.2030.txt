dunham 's book is only at the new york times , but it 's not clear whether dunham 's $ 3.7 million book deal with random house . " i realize that dunham is an easy target , from an artsy new york family and the creator , star and director of her own hbo show , " dunham writes . " it 's what the market will bear . i imagine dunham ’ s book will kick ass , yet it will also get its critical ass handed to itself because of the advance . if random house is already hucking it , " he writes in the washington post . " but her promises to advise readers on how to wear “ red lipstick with a sunburn of the dunham haters , ” dunham writes in a blog post . “ the dunham deal smacks of a search for the " barton fink touch , but first slate and then only a modestly-rated show : about a million people watched the finale on its air date and in its time slot , but instead of judging what cash value the dunham name realistically ought to have in the marketplace , i 'd rather think about her valuable ideas . and what could be a bigger benefit than $ 3.5 million ? it is a lot of money , by which i mean publishers who are corporate , bottom-line-driven , freighted with massive overhead and generally reactionary .
