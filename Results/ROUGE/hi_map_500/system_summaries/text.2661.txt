supreme court justice sonia sotomayor granted a temporary exemption late tuesday to a small group of catholic nuns that shields it from having to comply with a part of president obama 's healthcare law that requires it to provide contraceptive coverage in its insurance plans . she acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for the group who said the nuns faced " draconian fines " beginning on new year 's day if they failed to comply , the ap reports . sotomayor gave the government until friday to file a response in the case . her order extends only to the group of nuns and does not apply more broadly to the affordable care act and its requirements . the supreme court is facing a series of appeals from religious organizations and private corporations whose owners object to paying for contraceptives . in march , the court will hear two cases involving corporations and the contraceptive mandate . the obama administration has exempted churches and other religious groups from providing contraceptive coverage . however , it has granted a more limited exemption for religiously affiliated , but a decision on the merits of that case by the full supreme court could have broader implications .
