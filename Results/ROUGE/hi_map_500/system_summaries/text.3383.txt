the latest on the first court hearing for six baltimore police officers who are charged in the death of freddie gray , a black man who died a week after suffering a critical spine injury in custody , with baltimore state 's attorney marilyn j. mosby remaining at the helm of the prosecution . during a day of hearings in a downtown courtroom , judge barry williams swiftly sliced through complex legal arguments in the first motions hearing . in three key rulings issued from the bench , he refused to dismiss the charges or recuse mosby and decided that the case should be split to ensure that each officer gets a fair trial . williams said that trying the officers together would not be " in the interest of justice " because key evidence that 's admissible with regards to one officer may be inadmissible for another . the officers are charged with a range of offenses , from murder to misconduct , as each played a different role in gray 's arrest and transport . gray , 25 , died in april one week after williams had denied a defense motion seeking to have the charges dropped , the ap reports .
