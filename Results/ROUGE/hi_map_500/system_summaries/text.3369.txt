the sheriff of a restaurant owner has asked that law enforcement no longer dine . skagit county sheriff will reichardt said on facebook that after four deputies finished lunch at lucky 's teriyaki in sedro-woolley thursday , the owner asked them not to eat there anymore . the sheriff says his chief deputy called the owner later thursday and says the request was confirmed along with a request to spread the word among other law enforcement agencies . calls to the restaurant for comment were met with busy signals . reichardt says the owner 's request took him by surprise , as the skagit county community has an " overpowering show of appreciation " for deputies and officers serving there . " i said there must be a misunderstanding because i never feel that way when i go over there , " said mike bennett , who owns a business nearby . " it 's their right to refuse service . if customers feel threatened , just like with gang members , they hurt business , so they must go , " john rowlette said in the post .
