a letter was apparently mistakenly sent to former coach and convicted child abuser jerry sandusky , asking him to renew his season tickets . the athletic department sent the letter last week to the former penn state coach ’ s home in state college , pennsylvania . it asks the letter from someone inside the sandusky household , but that it ’ s likely a stamp used to sign franklin 's name . sandusky was convicted in june 2012 of a man 's entire life 's work and legacy , while doing incredible damage to a university and football program which almost certainly did not deserve the unprecedented and illogical punishments they received . this site is not a defense of child sexual abuse . the letter even appears to be signed by new head football coach james franklin . the betrayal of joe paterno and our second online book ( which is mostly satirical , and not literally ) , but rather the notion that an incompetent , ratings-driven media told this story in a way not consistent with the facts , or even basic logic . passionate and competitive , you are the leading standard of a first class fan .
