a tennessee high school student 's anti-bullying video has resulted in nearly 600,000 views on youtube and a suspension for its creator . lebanon high school administrators accused her of " trying to incite violence " and gave her a two-day suspension , but the school is saying it had nothing to do with her video 's message . emily gipson is a student at lebanon in lebanon , tennessee . on january 22 , she posted a youtube video of her performing a free-verse poem about bullying and suicide at her school . " so let 's summarize : we 're expected to come to this emotional prison because the authorities are sure they did n't mean it , ' or , my favorite , 'kids will be kids , " she said in the video , criticizing her peers ' reaction to the stop it app the wilson county school had put out in response to the death . her ire was not restricted to students , however . perhaps the harshest words in gipson 's free-verse speech were reserved for school administration . gipson was given a two-day indictment of campus culture , but contains neither profanity nor calls for direct action .
