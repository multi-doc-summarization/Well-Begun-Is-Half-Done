two young tibetan monks set themselves on fire to protest against government religious controls in western china on monday , reuters reports . the 18-year-old monks , kelsang and kunchak , belong to the kirti monastery , who asked not to be identified , adding that he obtained his information from at least five sources in china and overseas . " there is a complete set of religious rituals and historical conventions in reincarnation of the dalai lama and a dalai lama identifying his own successor has never been the practice , " he said . " the title of dalai lama is conferred by the central government and is illegal otherwise . " china 's foreign ministry said any reincarnation process would have to be conducted in accordance with other monks , and that china should have no say in the matter . under tibetan tradition , monks identify a young boy who shows signs he is a reincarnation of a late leader , but many predict china will simply appoint part of a larger homeland under tibetan control . " when asked about the self-immolations , the monks ' self-immolations could lead to a renewed crackdown in aba prefecture , a heavily ethnic tibetan part of sichuan province that many advocates of self-rule say should form its own successor to the dalai .
