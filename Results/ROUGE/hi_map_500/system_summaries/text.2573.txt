" he felt neglected by his wife because they had been fighting so he took his 11-month-old daughter to the site of the crime which is the abandoned hotel , " jirasak said . " i am also very sad . it is a personal dispute and they were still very young . " the man made the broadcast monday evening , and the video was made inaccessible by facebook late tuesday afternoon . facebook has been under scrutiny for what role it should play in overseeing the billions of posts and videos that are uploaded on its site each day . facebook â€™ s founder , mark zuckerberg , addressed the issue at a company conference this month in response to a case in which he climbed over the side to retrieve her body . the company pledged a review of its processes after footage of a us killing stayed online for hours this month . the footage of the thai killing had also been available on video sharing website youtube , but the company took it down after the bbc alerted it to its presence .
