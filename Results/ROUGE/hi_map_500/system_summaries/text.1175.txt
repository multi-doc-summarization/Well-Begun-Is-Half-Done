a new forensic investigation has found that there 's just absolutely no way the stains could have been made by a body laying flat on the fabric , the bbc reports . the shroud , which has been analyzed during the journal of forensic sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud , says it 's " just not what happens to a person on a cross , " per the new york times . the cloth has been thought to be the burial cloth of jesus , which is 14-feet-long , 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof , climate-controlled case . it 's not clear whether the vatican has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it , but it 's unclear that the vatican regards is a fake . " the shroud has long been the subject of debate and study , " says a forensic investigator . " it is regarded by the vatican as an icon , rather than a genuine religious relic . " ( this is the first time in the case of the cloth of turin . ) researchers say the cloth is " a fake , " but that 's not yet to be in the cathedral of st. john the baptist in turin .
