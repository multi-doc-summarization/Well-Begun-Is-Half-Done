bob dylan opened about his music and songwriting and discussed his relationships with frank sinatra and others in a rare and lengthy interview posted to his website wednesday . in the q & a with author bill flanagan , dylan recalled sinatra telling him , " 'you and me , pal , we got blue eyes , we 're from up there ... these other bums are from down here . ' " of the many superstars who died last year , including muhammad ali and merle haggard , dylan said the deaths hit him hard : " we were like brothers ... it 's the challenge of singing with a live horn section ? no challenge , it ’ s better than overdubbing them . you like to be spontaneous in the studio , but we went ahead and did these . why did you decide to release three discs of music at once ? it 's better that they come out at the same time because thematically they are interconnected , one is the sequel to the other and each one resolves the previous one . each disc is 32 minutes long – you could have put it all on 2 cds . is there something about the 10 song , 32 minute length that appeals to you ? sure , it 's a lucky number .
