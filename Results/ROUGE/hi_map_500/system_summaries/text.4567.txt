donald trump has backed wikileaks founder julian assange in casting doubt on intelligence alleging russian meddling in the us election , the ap reports . " assange ... said russians did not give him the info ! " the president-elect has repeatedly refused to accept the conclusions of the us intelligence community . several us agencies including the fbi and the cia believe russia directed hacks against the democratic party and the campaign of its presidential candidate hillary clinton . the information , released through wikileaks and other outlets , was intended to help mr trump win the election , say the " intelligence " briefing on so-called " russian hacking " was delayed until friday , perhaps more time needed to build a case . very strange ! it was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies ' unanimous conclusion that a " 14-year-old kid could have hacked " the emails of hillary clinton 's campaign chairman john podesta . " he called the alleged delay , " he said , per cnn . trump said russia was not the source for the site 's mass leak of emails from the democratic election .
