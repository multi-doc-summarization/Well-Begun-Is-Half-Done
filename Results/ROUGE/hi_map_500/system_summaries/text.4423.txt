two mysterious stone rings found deep inside a french cave were probably built by neanderthals about 176,500 years ago , proving that the ancient cousins of humans were capable of more complex behavior than previously thought , scientists say . the structures were made from hundreds of pillar-shaped mineral deposits , called stalagmites , which were chopped to a similar length and laid out in two oval patterns up to 40 centimeters ( 16 inches ) inches high . they were discovered by chance in 1990 , after remaining untouched for tens of thousands of years because a rockslide had closed the mouth of the cave at bruniquel in southwest france . the discovery suggested that neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for . they wielded fire , ventured deep underground , and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions . perhaps they even carried out rituals ; after all , there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave , so what else were the rings and mounds for ? rouzaud would never know . in april 1999 , a team led by archaeologist jacques jaubert of the university of bordeaux , france , found that the stalagmites rings were older than any known cave painting .
