hillary clinton 's campaign chairman says fbi director james comey 's decision to write to congressional leaders about emails uncovered in the bureau 's probe into anthony weiner , saying the timing of such a move was " unprecedented " and " deeply troubling . " kellyanne conway says that comey could be accused of interfering in the election if he did n't disclose that clinton-related emails were under fbi investigation for the second time in a year . john podesta says on cnn 's " state of the union " that comey should have reviewed the information more thoroughly before making the decision public . " it 's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election , " clinton said . " of course , donald trump is already making up lies about this . " the fbi concluded in july its investigation into clinton 's use of a personal email server . but comey told congress on friday that new emails were discovered during a separate investigation of former new york congressman , anthony weiner . the democratic nominee 's comments here marked an escalation in the clinton campaign 's full-out war against comey in the final 10 days of the election .
