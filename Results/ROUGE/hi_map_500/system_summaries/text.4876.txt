belgium 's royal family will start paying taxes for the first time since belgium declared independence in 1830 , members of the royal household will now have to pay taxes . the belgian government has been under pressure to reform the system of royal allowances after national media said queen fabiola , the widow of king baudouin , had planned to pass on an estate in spain by using a trust to avoid paying tax . the plan drew criticism from prime minister elio di rupo . under the current system , 53-year-old throne-heir prince philippe receives around 923,000 euros a year , but from now on he will instead receive a gross salary of 180,000 euros , subject to taxes . money earmarked for staff and expenses related to carrying out his job will be taken from the initial stipend and will not be taxed , but the constitution does not allow changing rules for the reigning royal . instead , it is the king 's children and the widow or widower of a deceased monarch will continue to receive money from the state . a monarch who abdicated would also lose its exemptions from paying income and value-added tax .
