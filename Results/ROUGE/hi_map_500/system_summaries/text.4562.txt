an anonymous driver claims to have made a lap of manhattan in a record time of 24 minutes and seven seconds , a stunt that the nypd does not find to be amusing . the man posted a video of the entire 26.5 mile loop taken from the dashboard of a bmw z3 . the driver , who goes by the code name afroduckproduction , says he broke the record even though he had to stop at six red lights . there has been a history of drivers recklessly trying to break the unofficial record since a driver posted a 27 minute trip around the island in 2001 . he raced down to lower manhattan and then back up the west side highway to the george washington bridge before cutting back east . the car is a stock 2006 bmw z4 . so what 's the route ? the driver starts on fdr/east side drive at 116th street , just outside of harlem . they tear down under the williamsburg , manhattan , and brooklyn bridges , then shoot through the battery park tunnel around the downtown tip of the island . after that there are the red lights of west street/west side drive , which finally opens up in midtown by all of trump 's buildings .
