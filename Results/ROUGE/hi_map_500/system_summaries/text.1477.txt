library doctors have issued a warning about the case of a woman they treated last year who became critically ill after taking herbal remedies and drinking too much water . the 47-year-old needed intensive care at milton keynes hospital . she recovered with treatment , but her story is a reminder of the dangers of drastic detoxing , the medics in their write-up . " there are no pills or specific drinks , patches or lotions that can do a magic job , " a representative says . " excessive water intake as a way of 'purifying and cleansing ' the body is also a popular regime with the belief that harmful waste products can thus be washed from the body . " the woman collapsed and had a seizure . medical tests revealed she had also been drinking lots of water , green tea and sage tea over the few days before she became ill . shortly before being admitted to hospital , the 47-year-old is not necessarily healthy and is not backed by medical science , they report in the british medical journal case reports . the british dietetic association says the whole idea of detoxing is nonsense .
