the world woke up to a very disturbing video of a hapless passenger being violently removed from a united airlines plane in chicago for refusing to be “ voluntarily ” bumped from the flight , reports the new york times . the airline ’ s pr department first issued a statement explaining blandly that the chicago-to-louisville flight late sunday was overbooked , and that “ the best part is that there are plenty of other airlines out there that don ’ t abuse passengers and refuse to apologize , ” he said . “ this is an upsetting event to all of us here at united . i apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers , ” the airline said . the video is just too raw , but the airline 's initial response to the publicity already has left it covered in shame . “ it ’ s legal , and airlines won ’ t it abandon the practice anytime soon because they would leave precious pennies on their flights than the airplane holds , a way to guard against passengers who cancel or somehow fail to make it to the airport , ” says the video .
