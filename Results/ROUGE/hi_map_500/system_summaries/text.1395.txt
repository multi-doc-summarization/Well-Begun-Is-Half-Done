rick perry said he was " taken aback " by cheers from some crowd members on a hypothetical question of whether a young man who decides not to buy health insurance should be refused care if he develops a life-threatening illness and be left to die . " what do you tell a guy who is sick , goes into a coma and does n't have health insurance ? who pays for his coverage ? are you saying society should just let him die ? " he said . " these kids showed up in our state by no fault of their own , some 2-3 years of age . and they 've been in our schools , they 've done their work , they want to be contributing members of society . so it would be i think the wrong message to say somehow or another that you ca n't go to our colleges , or we 've going to punish you because that 's the reason the cost is so high . " perry also responded to the crowd 's negative reaction to his support for children who were brought to the united states illegally . " we have given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves , assume responsibility for ourselves , particularly , innocent life , " he says .
