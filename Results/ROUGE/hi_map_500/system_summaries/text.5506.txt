florida has surpassed new york in population to become the third-most populous state in the union . figures released tuesday by the u.s. census bureau show that florida has at least 19.9 million residents . the number is likely higher because the census uses the population as of july 1 to create its estimate . new york â€™ s growth has been much slower than that of the sunshine state : florida has a way to go before it catches up with california and texas , the largest and second-largest states . the report shows 44 states and the district of columbia added population over the last year . migrants from other countries made up about a quarter of florida 's new residents , 2 million moved to the south and the south , with the exception of north dakota , where an energy boom is attracting new residents in droves . six states saw population declines : illinois , connecticut , new mexico , alaska , north carolina , and michigan . north carolina grew by michigan for the ninth spot on the list . florida likely reached the milestone sometime last spring , but it was n't official until the census .
