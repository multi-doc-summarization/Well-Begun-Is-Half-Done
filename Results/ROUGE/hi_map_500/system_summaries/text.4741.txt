french lawmakers voted in favour tuesday of a new law granting the state sweeping surveillance powers , with the aim of preventing islamist attacks . the bill passed the national assembly with 438 votes in favour and just 86 against after it gained the backing of the two main parties – . the law on intelligence-gathering , adopted by 438 votes to 86 , was drafted after three days of attacks in paris in january , in which 17 people died . the socialist government says the law is needed to take account of changes in communications technology . but critics say it gives too much power to the state and threatens the independence of the digital economy . " the bill ’ s advocates wanted a legal framework for the french intelligence agencies , which is a good thing . but the government is actually the us services , " he said , per the new york times . " it is a dangerous extension of mass surveillance . " france remains on high alert and has received repeated threats from jihadist groups , including the islamic state ( is ) group in the syria-iraq region . rights groups , however , have slammed the new proposals , which will have broader powers to look at classified material and handle complaints from the public .
