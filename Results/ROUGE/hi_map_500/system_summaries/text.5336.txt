george clooney 's latest directorial effort , the 1950 's satire " suburbicon , " has accumulated heaps of oscar gold , reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether there were a criminal charge for grand theft feature film , oscar isaac would be facing a long , long sentence , and in a film running a brief 104 minutes , he supplies 90 % of the entertainment in 5 percent of the time . as for the rest of the project , we 'll navigate the town 's dark underbelly of betrayal , deceit , and violence . this is a tale of very flawed people making very bad choices . clooney enlists julianne moore to trot out her tired stepford wife routine , no traffic and friendly neighbors . but there 's a catch and it is skin deep .

" let â€™ s take a moment first to count our blessings . "
