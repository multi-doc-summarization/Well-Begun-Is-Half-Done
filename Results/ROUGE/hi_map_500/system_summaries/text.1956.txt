the study of the spinal cord us scientists have made progress in repairing spinal cord injuries in animals with stark spinal cord damage , the ap reports . the study , published in the journal of neuroscience , could raise hopes for one day treating paralysed control restored for the first time in animals , bridging the rodents to grow and form new connections has proved elusive . one problem is the growth of scar tissue as the body 's responds to injury , which seems to block cell regeneration . if we can show in a larger animal that our technique works and does , it will take several years of research before human clinical trials can be considered . scientists have tried for decades to use transplants of nerve cells to restore function as catheters are used to provide individuals with more independence . methods of dribbling out urine or risk of infection generally involve surgery , for instance of the highest priorities for recovery of the intestine cord injury community where the spine is totally severed ( aside from , obviously , regaining control of limbs ) . it not only makes everyday life more difficult , but loss of bladder control can lead to serious infections in paralysed .
