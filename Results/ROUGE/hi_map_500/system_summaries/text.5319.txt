the team of the new york times calls it a " <unk> , " but that 's what it 's " a new maybach suv that can ferry passengers over desert dunes with an open top and thermal cupholders . " it 's not clear that the suv will have a v12 engine and a landaulet style , reports the wall street journal . it 's a " parts-bin productionâ€”but using only parts from the shelf , " says the lead researcher . the suv is " the world 's most expensive sport utility vehicle with a price of money because seemingly nobody cared ? well , after the maybach 57 and 62 were both killed off in 2012 , mercedes gave it another go , bringing the name back in 2015 as a sub-brand style , with a front row that 's covered and a retractable fabric above the top of the mercedes range . that 's not bad , given that maybach only offered variants of the s-class sedan and the s 650 cabrio ... up until the arrival of this : the g portion of the standard fixed roof has been replaced by a power-operated fabric top ( last available nearly four years ago ) . sure , daimler says one in every ten vehicles sold in the s-class segment wears a mercedes-maybach badge in the back .
