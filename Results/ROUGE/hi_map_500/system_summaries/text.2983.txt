president obama signed an executive order last week to raise the hourly pay for its u.s. employees to $ 9 in june 2015 , after the white house said the minimum wage for federal contract workers would be raised to $ 10.10 an hour in 2015 . gap , owner of old navy , banana republic , said the increased pay will benefit about 65,000 store employees . " i applaud gap for announcing that they intend to raise wages for their employees beginning this year , " said gap chairman and ceo glenn murphy . " our decision to invest in frontline employees will directly support our business , and is one that we expect to deliver a return many times over . " to us , this is not a minimum wage business . ninety-nine percent of our hourly associates , call centers and distribution centers currently earn more than the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour as it already pays most full-time employees above that level . " we are looking into the impact that this proposal will be on our business . " the move is expected to affect about 65,000 wages .
