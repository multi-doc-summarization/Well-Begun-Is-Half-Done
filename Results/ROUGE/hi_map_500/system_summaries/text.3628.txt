president trump 's attorney , rudy giuliani , said the president 's lawyers have not heard back from special counsel robert mueller 's office in an email asking supporters to donate to his legal defense fund . " i figured we would n't hear until after the manafort trial , but we ( still ) have n't , " giuliani said . " roger stone 's latest pitch to his email list of supporters boils down to this : donate right now because , literally , i am the next guy to get indicted . " he said mueller 's team is " still studying " the latest letter from trump 's hit list because i ’ ve advised donald trump for the past 39 years . i am being targeted not because i committed a crime , but because the 'deep state ' liberals want to silence me and pressure me to testify against my good friend president j j . trump , who said mueller ’ s team could be considering negotiating with what trump 's team offered or waiting until after a subpoena , which would mean the battle over a subpoena to the midterm elections .
