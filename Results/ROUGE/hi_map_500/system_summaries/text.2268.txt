a swedish doctor says four women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get pregnant , reports the ap . " we have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready , " says dr. mats brannstrom , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of goteburg , who is leading the research . brannstrom 's technique was achieved in turkey , but it failed after two months . " one or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry , and one of the others , they are <unk> , " said brannstrom . he would not say whether any of the nine women might succeed in giving birth , which would be a world first . other womb transplants have taken place in saudi arabia and turkey but no recipients have yet managed to produce eggs that were fertilised using ivf . the women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it 's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child .
