google is letting a larger segment of the public test its futuristic eyeglasses . google said it was accepting applications for people who wanted to try the glasses , which had previously been available only to software developers who signed up for them at google â€™ s conference last year , reports the new york daily news . the company posted on google 's project glass website , google offered some of its own ideas about project glass , including the user interface , through a series of photos and videos . you can see the ui and some of the features of glass in the gallery , although they do n't quite capture the exact experience . the headset does n't actually have lenses in front of your eyes , just a small screen ( viewable can include photos or video and an explanation of what they might do with the glasses ) . people who want a pair of the glasses before they are publicly available by feb. 27 by writing a post on google plus or twitter of 50 words or fewer with the hashtag 's right eye . as such , the point-of-view images that show a large action window in the center of the field of view are a little misleading . still , google glass could change advertising once engaged , glass is capable of taking photos , recording videos , looking up answers on google , showing reminders ( such as for a flight )
