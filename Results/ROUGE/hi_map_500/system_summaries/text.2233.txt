new research suggests there are hot springs bubbling beneath the icy surface of a tiny saturn moon . on earth , scientists have found weird life forms living in hydrothermal vents on the ocean bottom where there 's no sunlight . the research comes from cassini , a nasa-european spacecraft that launched in 1997 to explore saturn and its numerous moons from orbit . " the moon is actually alive in a sense , " says sean hsu with the laboratory for atmospheric and space physics at the university of colorado at boulder . beneath the surface , most researchers believe it even has a liquid ocean . now hsu and his colleagues have found new evidence that it 's a downright ocean at the base of enceladus 's ocean , which is also believed to contain many of the chemicals commonly associated with life . that activity would make the moon an even more attractive place in the solar system besides earth where hot water and rocks interact underground , per the ap . " this is yet another discovery , " said a planetary scientist at cornell university who works with the cassini spacecraft but was not involved in the new research .
