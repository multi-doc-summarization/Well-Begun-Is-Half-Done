afghan president obama has told the pentagon to prepare for the possibility that the united states will not leave behind any troops in afghanistan after its troop drawdown at the end of this year , the white house said on tuesday . obama said he had given the pentagon preparations because karzai has dragged his feet for too long in waiting to sign the bilateral security agreement he negotiated with washington and earlier put before a traditional advisory council , which endorsed it . " specifically , president obama told president karzai that because he has demonstrated that it is unlikely that he will sign the bsa , the pentagon has begun contingency plans to pull all american troops out of afghanistan , " he said , per the ap . obama 's ordered the order to the pentagon in a phone call on tuesday to afghan president hamid karzai , who has refused to sign a deal to keep u.s. troops beyond the end , the ap reports . obama , who spoke by phone with karzai on tuesday , has asked the door open to a post-2014 force of american troops that starts on wednesday .
