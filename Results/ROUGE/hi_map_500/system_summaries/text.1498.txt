" some of you may have noticed , i had a lot more energy in our second debate . i felt really well rested after the nice long nap i had in the first debate. ” romney , sitting with his wife ann a couple seats down on the dais at the waldorf-astoria hotel . romney said , " i heard from the federal election commission : from now on , whenever he appears on tv , there ’ s a recording of me afterward that , ‘ i ’ m mitt romney and i approve this message. .
