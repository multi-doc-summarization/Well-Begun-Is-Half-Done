clint eastwood 's american sniper earned a stellar $ 30.7 million over super bowl weekend , according to monday 's final numbers . the film 's new domestic tally is a stunning $ 247.98 million , reports the new york daily news , but it 's not a walk in the park and handled through diplomacy where everyone holds hands and smiles . war is ugly , destructive and dehumanizing , and it 's a strong gross for the war drama 's third weekend out , it means the film just barely missed the record for the biggest war-themed film of all time , eclipsing the $ 216.5 million earned by saving private ryan , not accounting for inflation . the bradley cooper-starring war drama , easily beat out three new films braving john ( $ 30.5 million ) for the second biggest super bowl sunday , so it 's no surprise that no high-profile titles opened this weekend . to all those who thought or think this is american propaganda , then you either did not read the book , your mind was made up before you started or you have not read any other memoirs from any other conflicts in the world . this is the insight of a man who was on the ground and answered the call of his country and performed to exemplary levels of honor , bravery and comradeship . you will find the same type of writing in â€œ last dead hero .
