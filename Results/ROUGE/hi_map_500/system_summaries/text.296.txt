president obama promised to use force against the armies of islamic state " wherever they are , " and he specifically mentioned syria . " the airstrikes mark a major reversal for obama . we find that prospect . islamic state is a heinous group , a threat to the nation almost two weeks ago , terrorized iraqi forces , terrorized christians and other minorities and seemed poised to attack baghdad . obama also was influenced , understandably , by the horrific beheadings of opponents whose division into moderate and extremist factions is n't nearly so neat or stable as some advocates of millions of dollars to train supposedly moderate syrian rebels , the airstrikes , an al qaeda offshoot on islamic state targets in syria monday night mark a welcome offensive that takes the war to the terrorists who beheaded two americans and with more force than expected , targeting not only islamic state but also hitting the khorasan branch of al qaeda that ... necessary with his successful lobbying of congress to spend hundreds of u.s. intervention suppose . obama changed his mind about intervention in syria for the same reason he decided to launch airstrikes in iraq and augment the u.s. military presence in that country : a sickeningly swift sequence of events in syria 's civil war , and for good reason .
