the owner of a los angeles-based restaurant wants his customers to put down their cellphones and talk to each other instead . " for us , it 's about two people sitting together and just connecting , without the distraction of a phone , and we 're trying to create an ambiance where you come in and really enjoy the experience and the food and the company , " gold says . " it seems like every five minutes there 's somebody calling , and it 's still going on . this is a hit , with just under half of all customers agreeing to the terms . " gold claims the incentive will be eligible to receive a 5 % discount . " i was shocked ... quite frankly , i did n't have any expectations . we were running for two months , and then , being slow in the summertime at the restaurant here , i figured i 'd send it to the local paper , " said gold on airtalk , per the new york daily news . " never did i think it would go this far . " he says he 's done about 40 interviews with major outlets .
