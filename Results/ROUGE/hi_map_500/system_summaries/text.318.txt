the atlantic 's derek thompson has a very interesting piece this week on what he calls the " brain dead politics " of the left and right and revived the term , third way , once used for non-aligned nations navigating between communism and capitalism . obama 's notion that one group favors the status quo while another wants a massive escalation in afghanistan , and a third wants a bit of a misnomer . " we are likely to waste more lives than we save . i thought that was true before obama 's big speech , and i still think it now , afterward . at the moment he needed all of his persuasive powers , " he said . " i do n't think it 's a lot of people . " obama has no clear path to " victory , " and that 's " not the sort of presidency anything in his past prepared him for . it means finally owning a war that will claim the lives of many more americans -- and , given the history of these things are bad , but still , few decisions seem as clear-cut as this one . escalation is hard to see as an exit strategy .
