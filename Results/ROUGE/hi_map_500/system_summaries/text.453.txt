a new zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice , with a gap of two years in their life , reports the new york times . the survey of the survey measured a person 's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits , and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another , depending on age , and had been replaced by conscientiousness . " domain specific " variations , " the oldest participants ' personality stability matched those of the youngest . other interesting finds that our personalities become increasingly stable as our 20s , 40s and even 50s , but that that stability then often begins to external factors , such as getting a job , getting married or becoming a parent , " says one researcher . " we might see as personality changes are actually just responses to what a person is dealing with at a particular point in the life . people in their 30s , for example , showed high levels of neuroticism , but by the time they reached their 50s that had tapered off , or stable , as we get older . that change is not linear , however . for certain traitsâ€”conscientiousness , openness , neuroticism and openness to experience , research digest writes .
