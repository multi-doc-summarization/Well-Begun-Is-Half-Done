the water is stored in the air space between particles of ice , similar to the way that fruit juice stays liquid in a slush drink , reports the new york times . " we thought we had an understanding of how things work in greenland , but here is this entire storage system of water we did n't realize was there , " says richard forster , lead study author and a glaciologist at the university of utah . the discovery of the greenland ice sheet has been a significant contributor to a rise in sea levels over the past 100 years . the ice sheet lost 34 billion tonnes of ice per year between 1992 and 2001 , and this increased to sea level rise , the ap reports . the research is published in the journal , nature geoscience , and researchers say the water will help scientists better understand the fate of greenland 's annual surface melt , which contributes the ice particles . the water also stored in southeast greenland , and the ice is n't clear whether the ice will be used to the ocean . " it 's not a lot of people , " he said .
