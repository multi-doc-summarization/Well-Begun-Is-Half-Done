a new york family scored a huge payday for $ 3 , turned out to be a 1,000-year old chinese piece that sold for $ 2.2 million at sotheby 's yesterday , reports the bbc . the family bought the rare bowl at the secondhand sale in 2007 , and kept it sitting on their mantle for years , the auction house said . author rose kerr believes the ornamental ding bowls were made to mimic the more elaborate gold and silver wares that were common in palaces . the ancient piece of the potting seen here is evident in the feather light weight of the bowl with the carved walls especially thin and delicate . the whiteness of the body is also special , as is the case with most ‘ ding ’ wares , it did not require the application of a slip to appear white after firing . for example , see it would sell for somewhere in the $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 range . but yesterday , london art dealer giuseppe eskenazi blew away a high level of naturalness and fluidity , however , the maker of this bowl appears to have been particularly skilled at rendering his lines in a spontaneous manner , creating a decoration that is especially free in style .
