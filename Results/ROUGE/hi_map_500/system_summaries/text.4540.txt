president obama 's convention speech was never going to be a make-or-break moment for him to move anyone with his convention closer , the new york daily news reports . obama 's speech clocked in at 38 minutes and 23 seconds , the briefest nomination acceptance speech by a president since gerald ford in 1976 . the speech will certainly send convention-goers back to their home states excited about the final 60 days of the campaign and there were enough appeals to the political four without making himself sound like a failure . obama simply didn â€™ t rank near the top tier of his own presidential speeches , and he gave the fourth best speech of the union address than a convention acceptance speech . it was roughly 26 minutes shorter than the record-holder since 1972 , and the shortest speech for a president running for reelection in hard times is to explain how the next four years would be different from the political convention , the guardian reports . the democratic national convention is over and the sprint of the democratic convention , which is expected to be in the country , notes the bbc .
