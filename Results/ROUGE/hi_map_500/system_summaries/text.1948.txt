the tea party has no leader , but it 's not clear to be a third party . " it is unclear whether they are just hard to reach or do n't exist , " says matt ney , 55 , the owner of a pilates studio and a founder of the pearland tea party patriots in pearland , tex , per the new york times . " i am not a member of any organized party . it is everywhere and nowhere . for the rest , they have no official candidate slates , have not rallied behind any particular national leader , have little money on hand , and remain ambivalent about their goals and the political process in general . " the post notes that the post 's tea party is the quintessential asymmetrical enemy , which is the internet party , and the post has a " <unk> democrat and an early-21st-century tea party member , much like the taliban in afghanistan . " " we 're not so much a movement as a disparate band of vaguely connected gatherings that do surprisingly little to engage in the us party , " writes the post .
