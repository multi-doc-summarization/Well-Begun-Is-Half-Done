president trump drove out his chief of staff on friday , replacing reince priebus with homeland security secretary john kelly in an explosive move that ends a turbulent six-month tenure . " the president wanted to go a different direction , " priebus told cnn 's wolf blitzer on " the situation room " friday evening . " i 'm on team trump and i look forward to helping him achieve his goals and his agenda for the american people . i think it 's a good time to hit the reset button . " priebus of infighting among trump 's staff eventually devolved into all-out warfare , bursting dramatically into the open late thursday with a vulgar screed from incoming communications director anthony scaramucci . priebus also lacked strong support from key members of trump 's inner circle . the move followed months of on-again , off-again speculation that priebus would soon be ousted from an administration where he has consistently drawn heavy criticism for failing to stem the flow of leaks and struggled to impose a sense of order in a chaotic white house beset by controversies . priebus , who was brought on by the outsider president in large part because of his washington relationships , also wound up carrying a positive spin on the president 's abrupt decision to pass a health care replacement bill .
