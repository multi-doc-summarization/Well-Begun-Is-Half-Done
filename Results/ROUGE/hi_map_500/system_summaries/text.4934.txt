president obama is seriously considering circumventing congress with his executive authority and imposing new background-check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers . under the proposed rule change , it now looks as if political gunfights will be breaking out all over the presidential race . how to combat gun violence could become a real issue in the 2016 race : the republican presidential candidates have seemed to adopt the position that there is little the federal government can do about it , and today , in an effort to contrast with that willfully defeatist posture , hillary clinton rolled out some concrete proposals . clinton ’ s new plan , which she will discuss on the campaign trail today , includes a raft of ideas : closing loopholes in the background check system ; more aggressive action to revoke the survivors and families of those killed in last week 's mass shooting at umpqua community college , the political calculus around his most vexing domestic policy issue , and on jan. 26 , 2013 , the president announced 23 executive actions ranging from restarting federal research . clinton 's campaign says that this could theoretically be accomplished via a new rule by the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and explosives that would more clearly define what it means to be “ engaged in the business ” of selling firearms .
