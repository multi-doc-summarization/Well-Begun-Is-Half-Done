rep. trent franks , an arizona republican who 's been outspoken in remembrance of rep. gabrielle giffords in the wake of saturday 's shooting , says he wishes one additional person had possessed a firearm in tucson on saturday , presumably to use on jared lee loughner . " i wish there had been one more gun there that day in the hands of a responsible person , that 's all i have to say , " franks said , visibly irritated at a question about increased gun control . the argument that more firearms would result in greater security -- especially in cases such as the one over the weekend -- has been a common argument for gun-rights activists , bolstered by headlines such as this . rep. steve scalise ( r-ariz. ) , who plans to carry a concealed weapon to events , said he thought that e-mails from capitol hill law enforcement officials would later pass out written information on the any increased security . much of the talk is centering around lawmakers increasing coordination with local law enforcement when they 're back in the district . rep. jason chaffetz ( r-utah ) , the armed man ( with no proper weapons training ) who helped stop the shooting spree , may only have come quicker than it did .
