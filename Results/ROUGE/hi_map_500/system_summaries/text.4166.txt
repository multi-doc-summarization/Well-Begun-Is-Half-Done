the food and drug administration announced on tuesday that it will make a brand of emergency contraception known as plan b one-step available over the counter for women ages 15 and older , and with a prescription for younger teens . " research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the united states , " says fda commissioner margaret hamburg in a statement . " the data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how plan b , and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease . " a panel of scientists at the fda only partially complies with a ruling handed down by a federal judge in early april , which instructed the fda to lift all age restrictions on plan b and make it available to everyone on pharmacy shelves . a customer who can not provide age verification will not be able to purchase the product . in addition , teva has arranged to have a security tag placed on all product cartons to prevent theft .
