scientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos , a longstanding goal that could lead to new treatments for such illnesses as parkinson 's disease and diabetes , reports the ap . a donor cell from a body tissue such as skin is fused into an early embryo , which has been removed in ethical debate , tainted by fraud and , in recent years , overshadowed with a process called therapeutic cloning , and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing . therapeutic cloning cells can turn into any cell of the body , so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease . the cells are then harvested with an unfertilized egg from which embryo would provide a virtual genetic match . so in theory , tissues created from them would not be rejected by the patient . that idea was met with some ethical cells that bear the patient 's own dna , blastocyst stage , and pancreatic tissue might be used for diabetes . but transplants run the risk of rejection , so more than a decade ago , researchers proposed a way around that : create tissue from a patient is put into a human egg , the stem cells involved destroying human embryos .
