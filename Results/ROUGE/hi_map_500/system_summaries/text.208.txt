president trump has privately floated the idea of funding construction of a border wall with mexico through the us military budget in conversations with advisers , two sources confirmed to cnn tuesday . trump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week with house speaker paul ryan , a source familiar with the meeting last wednesday in the white house residence . ryan offered little ­reaction to the idea , these people said , but the move would likely face steep hurdles with appropriators in congress . the idea is trump 's latest attempt to find a way to build the border wall he promised supporters during his campaign as mexico has dismissed his call for mexico to fund its construction . the source noted that additional authorization from congress would likely be necessary if this option was pursued . trump 's pursuit of defense secretary jim mattis and congressional leaders that the pentagon could fund the sprawling project , citing a “ national security ” risk . after floating the notion to several advisers last week when trump would pay for a wall along the southern border , is privately pushing the u.s. military to fund construction of his signature project .
