the connecticut supreme court today found that the state can forcibly medicate a man accused of killing a yale doctor and to mental and physical bodily integrity , as well as conflict with a 2003 workplace dispute wang had with toor and other doctors when they worked together at kingsbrook jewish medical center in new york city . wang , a chinese citizen from beijing , is charged from the medical center that year after a judge ruled him incompetent last year and assigned a public defender . in november , new haven superior court judge thomas o'keefe ruled that state officials could forcibly medicate wang to make him competent to stand trial and that doing so would not violate wang 's constitutional rights or the 2003 u.s. supreme court ruling . o'keefe 's decision was put on hold pending the supreme court appeal . a main issue in the appeal was whether prosecutors showed that it was " substantially likely " that forcing medication on wang would restore him to competency . the state supreme court confirmed that it is substantially likely that wang would be made competent by the medication , and that the drugs are in wang â€™ s medical best interest . wang is charged with attempted murder on allegations he shot at toor 's pregnant wife , who was n't injured . wang has pleaded not guilty , and he has insisted he is competent and does n't need medication .
