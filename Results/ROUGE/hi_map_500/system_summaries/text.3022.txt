" we found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet came to unravel an important mystery surrounding climate change , " says the study author paul bierman , who believe that the tundra has been buried from beyond the dawn offshore 130,000 years ago . " this landscape has been preserved , " said a spokesman for the scottish universities environmental research centre and the university of california . " now we know that it 's unlikely the us sheet has disappeared . " the new results also mean the greenland sheet is much older than previously thought , having endured previous periods of global warming . the new findings hint that at summit , frozen and plant dna buried in the seafloor offshore of greenland remained frozen , meaning the land has stayed hidden and unchanged for millions of years .
