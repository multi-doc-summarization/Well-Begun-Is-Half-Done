hillary clinton was running against an inexperienced , untested young senator named barack obama . clinton was known as one of the most serious policy wonks to ever run for president , and her network included most of the democratic party 's top policy staff , many of whom had worked directly for her or her husband , reports the new york daily news . the iraq war loomed largest here , but a smaller , though still important moment was when hillary clinton proposed suspending the federal gas tax for the summer travel season . economists hate this sort of policy pander : it encourages people to use more gas , robs the highway trust fund of revenue that needs to be raised some other way , and ends up the gop tax season . clinton 's new opposition to the trans-pacific trust trade accord cleans up something she needed to do before next week 's first democratic debate . and , yes , it puts out to all the democratic policy establishment ended up supporting obama . no one doubted that clinton knew policy inside and out ; they doubted that she would make the right calls in the face of public pressure .
