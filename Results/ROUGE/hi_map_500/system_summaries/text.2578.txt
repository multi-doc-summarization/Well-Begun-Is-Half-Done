mitt romney , who has backed gun control measures in a colorado movie theater , is " not a time to be talking about the politics associated with what happened in aurora , " romney said . " i still believe that the second amendment is the right course to preserve and defend and do n't believe that new laws are going to make a difference in this type of tragedy , " he said , per reuters . " the law that we signed in massachusetts was a combination of efforts both on the part of those that were for additional gun rights and those that opposed gun rights , and they came together and made some changes that provided , i think , a better environment for both , and that 's why both sides came to celebrate the signing of the debate . " romney 's lawrence kudlow in an interview with romney and his opponent , democratic president obama , have demurred on the prospect of new gun control laws in the days since a gunman opened fire during a showing of the new " batman " movie in a denver suburb early on friday . " where there are opportunities for people of reasonable minds to come together and find common ground , that 's the kind of legislation i like . "
