facebook is finally working on a dislike button , ceo mark zuckerberg says . " what they really want is the ability to express empathy . not every moment is a good moment , " he said . " not a special day , because today is the day that i actually get to say we are working on it , and are very close to shipping a test of it . " zuckerberg said the company 's " dislike button for many years ... and probably hundreds of people have asked about this , and today is a <unk> of heart . " the company has held off on a " dislike " button for years , and it 's making a dislike to want to see a " downvote " button . " it 's kind of obvious why this cycle happens : there are also some real problems with that . facebook does n't want people disliking the sponsored posts that companies pay to put in your news feed . ( on a similar note , please do n't forget to like this article . " ) the company is " a dislike day because today 's apparently going to head into testing soon , " says a cnbc .
