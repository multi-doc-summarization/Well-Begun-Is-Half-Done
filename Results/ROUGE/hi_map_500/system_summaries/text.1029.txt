president obama told his war-weary country on saturday that america needs to use limited military force in syria to deter future chemical weapons attacks , but said he did not want to enter into another costly and protracted war . " this is not something that i think a lot of folks around the world , you know , find an appetizing set of choices , " obama said . " but the question is , do these norms mean something ? and if we 're not acting , what does that say ? " the president had hoped to use the meeting of the group of 20 nations to build pressure on congress as it considers whether to authorize missile strikes against syrian president bashar assad 's government . a reuters/ipsos poll on tuesday said 56 percent of americans believed the united states should not intervene , while only 19 percent supported action . " i know that the american people are weary after a decade of war , even as the war in iraq has ended , and the war , in afghanistan is winding down . that 's why we take would be limited , both in time and scope , " he said .
