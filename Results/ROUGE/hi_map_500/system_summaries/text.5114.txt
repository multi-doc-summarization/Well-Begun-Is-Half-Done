wildlife officials in thailand have begun removing some of the 137 tigers held at a buddhist temple following accusations that the monks were involved in illegal breeding and trafficking of the animals . the director of thailand 's wildlife conservation office , teunjai noochdumrong , said three tigers were tranquilized and transported monday in an operation involving about 1,000 state personnel that is expected to continue for a week . the temple , a popular money-earning tourist attraction in the western province of kanchanaburi , has been criticized by animal rights activists because of allegations it is not properly set up to care for the animals and flouted regulations restricting their trade . the monks resisted previous efforts to take away the tigers , and the plan fell through when the government determined that the operators failed to secure sufficient resources . " when our vet team arrived , there were tigers roaming around everywhere , " noochdumrong says . " looks like the temple intentionally let these tigers out , trying to obstruct our work . " the temple 's 137 tigers posed a danger to visitors and that they were being mistreated . a tourist poses for a photo with a tiger at the thai temple in 2012 .
