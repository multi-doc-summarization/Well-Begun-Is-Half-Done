germany 's finance minister says he ca n't see room for further concessions to greece and wage cuts to find the final 1.5 billion euros of savings still needed , a source close to the talks say . " the political leaders do n't disagree on anything , there are just alternative proposals being discussed to protect those with low pensions or incomes in the public sector , " the source says . " we want to help and we will stay as long as it takes and until the plan is finalized , " imf mission chief poul thomsen tells the greek finance minister , adding that " the aid program is already very accommodating . i can not see that there is still scope for further . " greece 's government last week managed to draw up a list of measures to achieve those savings , but the three parties in his conservative-led administration failed to agree on them , and are due to resume talks on monday . greek officials have called for more time to convince skeptical european union and international monetary fund lenders it has turned over a new leaf and is ready to push through long-delayed to overhaul its recession-hit economy .
