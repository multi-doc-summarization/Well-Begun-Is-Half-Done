an indiana man facing weapons and ammunitions charges in california after telling officers he was headed to a gay pride event was charged wednesday in indiana with child molestation allegations that apparently spurred his cross-country journey to los angeles , a prosecutor said . james wesley howell howell , 20 , faces one count of child molesting in southern indiana 's clark county . if convicted , the jeffersonville , indiana , man could face up to 16 years in prison . clark county prosecutor jeremy mull told the associated press that howell took a 12-year-old girl to a state forestry property may 31 and had sex with her . " he did flee and go to california , where he was apprehended on june 12 , so there was a very short window of time between these crawls , " he said . the girl 's mother reported the allegations to police june 2 after a police detective in the molestation case and apparently left indiana at some point after speaking to the officer . he said it 's a " logical conclusion to draw " that howell traveled to california to flee the child molestation investigation .
