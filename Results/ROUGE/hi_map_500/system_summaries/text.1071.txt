hiroo onoda , the last japanese imperial soldier to emerge from hiding and surrender 29 years after the end of world war ii , has died . he was 91 . his death , at a hospital there , was announced by the japanese government . caught in a time warp , mr. onoda , a second lieutenant , was one of the war â€™ s last holdouts : a soldier who believed that the emperor was a deity and the war a sacred mission ; who survived on bananas and coconuts and sometimes killed villagers he assumed were enemies ; who finally went home to the lotus land of paper and wood which turned out to be a futuristic world of skyscrapers , television , jet planes and atomic destruction . japanese history and literature are replete with heroes who have remained loyal to a cause , especially if it is lost or hopeless , and lieutenant onoda , japanese , a small , wiry man of dignified manner and military bearing , seemed to many like a samurai of old , ultimately offering his sword as a gesture of surrender to president ferdinand e. marcos of the philippines , who returned it to him . and his homecoming , with roaring crowds , celebratory parades and speeches by japanese history , and pollution and pollution , per the washington post .
