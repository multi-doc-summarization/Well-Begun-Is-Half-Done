scientists say they are well on the way to resurrecting an ancient species of super-cow revered by the nazis after it died out in poland in 1627 , and adolf hitler 's followers tried to breed a similar beast as part of their aryan mythology , reports the bbc . " we thought we needed a grazer that is fully self-sufficient in case of big predators ... and could do the job of grazing big wild areas , " says a founder of the rewilding europe group . " in conjunction , the seventh generation of neo-aurochs will be as close as possible to the originals . " the theory is that the earliest cows were the largest land mammals in europe , until the rise of human civilization decimated their numbers , and the last of the first recorded cases of extinction . conservationists , the tauros , bred from a number of current species with auroch ancestry , have been released into areas of spain , portugal , and romania , the czech republic reports . the theory of the beast is returned to the test , which is expected to be a " near 100 % substitute . "
