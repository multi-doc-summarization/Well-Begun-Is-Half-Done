india 's government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat , eggs and lusty thoughts . doctors say the advice is preposterous , and even dangerous , considering india 's already-poor record with maternal health . women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally patriarchal indian households . the recommendations are part of a booklet called mother and child care , have spiritual thoughts behind india 's having one of the world 's highest rates of maternal mortality , with 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulting in the mother 's death in 2015 . that 's better than five years earlier , when the maternal mortality rate was 205 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births , but still far worse than china 's 27 per 100,000 or the united states ' 14 per 100,000 , according to unicef . " the government is doling out unscientific and irrational advice in your room to have a healthy baby . this is ministry of ayush 's prescription for pregnant women in india , where 26 million babies are born some good and beautiful pictures in the bedroom , which will affect the child also . pregnant women must stay away from desire , anger , hatred and lust .
