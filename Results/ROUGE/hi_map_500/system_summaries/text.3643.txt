" el chapo " slipped out through a prison tunnel in the brazen escape , taking advantage of a cell security camera , per afp . the exact reason for the move is unclear , but it comes one month after a mexican lawyer leading his legal defense team said his client wanted to be extradited to strengthen his maximum-security prison in altiplano . mexico did not warn the us authorities before guzman 's maximum-security , a us government official told afp , " due to the proximity ( to the us ) , it makes it easier to extradite him , " the official says .
