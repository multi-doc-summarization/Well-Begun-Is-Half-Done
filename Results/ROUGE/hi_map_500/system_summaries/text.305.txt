cape musk 's launch company went through with the falcon 9 rocket launch at launch complex 39a , sending a spy satellite for the national reconnaissance office into orbit from florida 's space coast , the ap reports . the flight appeared to be off to a good start , but spacex cut off its launch broadcast a few minutes into the flight to help preserve its secrecy , as is standard practice during nro missions . wind shear is the variation in wind speeds or direction at different altitudes . a large difference can harm rockets heading into space , embry-riddle aeronautical university meteorology professor thomas guinn says . " if the wind shear were outside the range of pre-calculated , safe limits … the rocket wouldn ’ t be able to stay on trajectory , " he said . " or worse , could potentially over stress the rocket , causing catastrophic failure. . worrying and landing of the nro spy satellite was good . tough call , as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6 % of the theoretical load limit . " musk posted on twitter that the mission launched successfully after nearly being scrubbed by strong high-altitude winds .
