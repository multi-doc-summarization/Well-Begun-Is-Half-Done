the european union has been on the list of nobel peace prize candidates , but the nobel prize is a tribute to the eu 's international reconciliation work . the nobel committee cited the eu prize to " peace and reconciliation , democracy and human rights , " according to the new york times . " however , as many people are pointing by economic turmoil and the currency union shared by most of its members appears to be a massive mistake . given the current money problems , the prize of $ 1.2 million almost seems like mockery , though some are interpreting the decision as a giant pep talk for a continent that sorely needs a reminder of what it can accomplish . and still , national governments take the lead in the council of the award , where a constant conflict exists between national and european interests . the european parliament is also unique in that representatives from all 27 member states have a nearly equal ability to influence legislation . citizens of the eu can move among and live in any of the other member states , and the internal market provides companies with access to a massive market and the opportunities it can offer .
