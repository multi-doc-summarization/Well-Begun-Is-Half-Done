fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight , rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat , new research reports . " the insects turn because they have some internal control circuitry , just like a pilot [ who 's ] turning a plane , " wang says . " and by looking how the insects , we might be able to say what the 'pilot ' is thinking . " dickinson , who was not involved in the april 11 issue of science , says it 's not clear whether they 'll pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would . " they do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement , " dickinson said in a news release , per the new york daily news . " we discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second , 50 times faster than we blink our eyes , which is faster than <unk> hydei , " he says , per us weekly . " it ’ s not to be a lot of the <unk> ”
