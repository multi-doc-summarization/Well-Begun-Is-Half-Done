president trump escalated his attacks on attorney general jeff sessions on monday , suggesting the department of justice put republicans in midterm jeopardy with recent indictments of two gop congressmen . in his latest broadside against the justice department 's traditional independence , trump tweeted that " obama era investigations , of two very popular republican congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge , just ahead of the mid-terms , by the jeff sessions justice department . " the indictment into collins lays out behavior from 2017 . both seats appear likely to remain in gop hands , but the charges have raised democratic hopes . a spokeswoman for sessions declined comment , and the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment . trump , who did not address the specifics of the charges , did not name the republicans . but he was apparently referring to the first two republicans to endorse him in the gop presidential primaries . both were indicted on separate charges last month : rep. duncan hunter of california on charges that included spending campaign funds for personal expenses and rep. chris collins of new york on insider trading . hunter has not exited his race , while collins ended his re-election bid days after his indictment . the hunter investigation began in june 2016 , according to the indictment .
