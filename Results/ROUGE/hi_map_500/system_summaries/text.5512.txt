the first map showing the world 's hidden groundwater was published on monday , bringing us closer to estimating out if we over-use the resource . using data and computer models , an international team of researchers estimated that less than six percent and perhaps as little as one percent of water found close to the earth 's surface is renewable in a human lifetime . " this has never been known before , " tom gleeson of canada 's university of victoria and the lead author of the study , said in a statement . " we already know that water levels in lots of aquifers are dropping . we 're using our groundwater resources too fast -- faster - faster than they 're being renewed . " the study also notes that the study has produced the first data-driven estimate of the global volume of groundwater was attempted in the 1970s . the study says it 's increasing demand to know how much we have and how long before it 's tapped out . " with the growing global demand for water -- especially in light of climate change , this study provides important information to water managers and policy developers as well as scientists from the bottom of lakes and rivers .
