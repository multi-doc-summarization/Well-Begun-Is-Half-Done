the australian study interviewed more than 500 men aged 18 to 72 , who were divided into facial hair categories , on their attitudes towards women , reports the new york times . the researchers found that men who grow beards are more likely to allow their facial hair to grow than men with less sexist attitudes , the bbc reports . " women who score high on measures of hostile sexism more strongly agree with statements such as “ once a woman gets a man to commit to her , she usually tries to put him on a tight leash , " or “ women seek to gain power by getting control over men , " the research says . " we hypothesized that men with facial hair were significantly higher in hostile sexism than clean-shaven men ; hostile sexism was a significant role in perceptions of an array of sociosexual traits in men . " men , however , say that men are more sexist than their clean-shaven attitudes , and that the men are inferior , and the researchers say they 're not sure if the men will be more likely . " the researchers are n't sure that we 're not going to be sexist , " he says .
