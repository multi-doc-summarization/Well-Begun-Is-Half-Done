president obama jumped in the last three months as he builds a war chest for what will likely be the costliest presidential election ever . at least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president , compared to 27 in obama 's first report , according to anthony corrado , a campaign finance expert at colby college in maine . " the emphasis has been on doing larger dollar fundraising events particularly asking for $ 2,500 , " he said . " events like this help him to raise substantial amounts of money for the campaign allowing him to exceed them . " romney has raised $ 1.5 million from employees of firms like morgan stanley ; highbridge capital management , a hedge fund ; and blackstone , a private equity firm . mr. obama has raised far more money than mr. obama this year from the firms that have been among wall street â€™ s top sources of campaign cash in 2008 . the president 's campaign finance report shows he can still pull in major cash despite a stagnant small donor operation , dipping approval ratings and grumblings among some liberal supporters that he has not done enough for their cause .
