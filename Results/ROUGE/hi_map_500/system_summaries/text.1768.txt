arizona rep. gabrielle giffords is in critical condition after being shot in the head on saturday morning . " if the bullet goes through both hemispheres , but you get shot side to side , the survival rate is less , and it all depends on the damage the brain has. , " a doctor tells the university medical center in tucson . " your best chance of survival is from front to back , that is where most of the vascular tissues are , and that can be a deadly result . i am very optimistic about her recovery . " giffords , meanwhile , says the bullet went through her brain , and he used his .40-caliber glock pistol to commit suicideâ€”shooting himself twice from under the chin , and then once through the right side of his head . the bullet travels through the mouth and nose instead of back into the head , where the recoil can angle the muzzle toward the face . in this case , the victim of such a wound would suffer serious injuries to the face ; he kept missing the brain . a sheriff 's deputy in wisconsin killed his ex-girlfriend and five others at a house party on sunday , then fled .
