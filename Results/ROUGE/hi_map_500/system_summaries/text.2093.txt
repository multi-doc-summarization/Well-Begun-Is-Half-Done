british police have warned about people in clown outfits acting suspiciously and sometimes wielding knives as they follow people . the warning saturday follows a string of incidents in recent days in an apparent effort to copy clown-related threats in the united states . police in gloucestershire say the force received a call at about 8.35pm thursday after children were scared by people with clown masks in park road , stretford reports . police say a masked man with a knife jumped out and threatened children in durham on friday and that several people dressed as clowns chased a young boy the day before in suffolk . officers in neighbouring cheshire revealed they have received a small number of reports , and declared it unacceptable for people to dress up as clowns to scare others . " if we appreciate halloween is just a short time away , scaring people - especially children and vulnerable people - in this way is completely unacceptable and could constitute an offence , " a spokesman says . " we are aware of the current trend in america of people dressing up as <unk> , which has reached the uk and received some publicity in the media . "
