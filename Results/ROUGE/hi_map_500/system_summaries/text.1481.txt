donald trump is making the unprecedented assertion that the general election " is going to be rigged , " and many people who are drawn to his presidential campaign have major doubts about the accuracy of the nov. 8 vote . only about one-third of republicans say they have a great deal or quite a bit of confidence that votes on election day will be counted fairly , according to a poll from the associated press-norc center for public affairs research . half the people who have little to no confidence in recent weeks in the race between hillary clinton and 2014 , there were only 31 known cases of impersonation fraud . clinton has improved her position nationally and in florida , but she 's made a bit more progress in the sunshine state , moving it closer to the national average . clinton leads by about 3 percentage points nationally and by about 1 point in florida . florida tends to be a crucial battleground state in presidential elections ( more on this in a moment ) , but it â€™ s up from 16 percent just two weeks ago . there is no evidence it is a widespread problem in the united states .
