the parents of seriously ill toddler alfie have launched a further appeal in a bid to take him to italy for treatment , the ap reports . a high court judge said his ruling " represents the final chapter in the life of this extraordinary little boy . " but alfie 's parents , who are backed by a christian pressure group , have been granted a chance to challenge that ruling at the appeals court wednesday afternoon . doctors from alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool , where alfie has been treated since december 2016 , say he has little brain function and further treatment is futile . the family of appeal judges have retired to consider their decision . at the start of the hearing , three senior judges heard alfie , whose life support was removed on monday , was " struggling " and a military air ambulance was on standby " at the request of the pope and italian authorities , who suffers from a degenerative neurological condition that has left him in a " semi-vegetative state . " he would leave no stone unturned ... he is clutching at straws , " he said .
