the polish ambassador to washington has summoned the us ambassador and demanded an apology over comments on the holocaust by fbi director james comey . the foreign ministry said comey had suggested in a washington post article that some poles were killed by the nazis during world war two , half of them jewish . " in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of germany , and poland , and hungary , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil , " he said . " i was born into an irish catholic family in this great , wonderful and safe country , but the holocaust has always haunted me , and it has long stood as a stumbling block to faith . how could such other places didn . " the director of the fbi , in a speech that was reprinted in the post arguing for more holocaust education , demonstrated just how badly he needs it himself . in two poorly worded sentences , he sounded to polish readers as if he were repeating the world war ii myth that most drives them crazy : namely , those who lived in occupied eastern europe shared full responsibility for a german policy .
