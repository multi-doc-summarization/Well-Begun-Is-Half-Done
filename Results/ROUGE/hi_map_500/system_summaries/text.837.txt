an irish woman terminally ill with multiple sclerosis lost her landmark high court challenge to the absolute ban on assisted suicide . marie fleming , a 59-year-old former university lecturer who is completely paralysed , has played out through recent high-profile court cases in neighbouring britain , where three people all failed in bids to win legal assistance to die . assisted suicide is only permitted in four european countries : belgium ; luxembourg , the netherlands and switzerland . the court also found the director of public prosecutions could not issue guidelines setting out what facts she would consider in deciding whether to avoid a sense of being a burden on their family and society . it said it would be impossible to tailor legislation governing assisted suicide on an individual basis and doing so would be harmful to the public interest in protecting the most vulnerable members of 18 years to help her die , an act that could have the effect of the law not being enforced . it 's not clear whether the ban is " rendered miserable " after being " ravaged by an insidious disease , " per reuters . the woman 's " real risk " of removing the ban was that , even with rigorous safeguards , it 's " reliable " evidence .
