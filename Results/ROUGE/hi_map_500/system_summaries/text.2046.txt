iran 's supreme leader on wednesday urged europe to do more to back the 2015 nuclear deal after president trump refused to re-certify the pact . european companies have rushed into the iranian markets since the landmark accord , which lifted international sanctions in exchange for restrictions on iran 's nuclear program . ayatollah ali khamenei , in his first reaction since donald trump decertified the iran deal , said on wednesday that “ we will not tear up the nuclear deal so long as the other side has not torn it up , but if they do , we will cut it in pieces . " the 78-year-old ayatollah told a gathering of students in tehran that the us was angry because iran had foiled its plots in lebanon , syria , iraq and egypt . " i don ’ t want to waste our time to respond to the rants and whoppers of the brute accord , " the supreme leader said . iran 's comments come after last week announced that he would not recertify iran 's compliance in the accord , though he did not pull out of the pact , which provided tehran with sanctions relief in exchange to its nuclear program , the ap reports .
