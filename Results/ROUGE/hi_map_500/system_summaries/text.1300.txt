portland police said they decided to reopen its investigation into sexual assault allegations against former vice president al gore after finding " procedural " mistakes in how the bureau handled the case in 2009 . the bureau 's command-level supervisors should have reviewed the case and should have made the decision on whether the investigation should move forward when the second time she went to police , portland police chief michael reese said in a statement . " in reviewing this case , we have determined there were procedural issues with the 2009 investigation that merit re-opening the case , " reese says . " there should have been command level review at the time on the specifics of this case . i have asked detectives to assign appropriate resources in the interest of conducting a complete investigation in an expedited investigation . " the case began in 2006 when an portland interview with the woman who accused gore of sexual assault , molly hagerty , says the decision to reopen the case was solely the bureau . " it is our responsibility to both parties involved to conduct a thorough , fair and timely investigation . as with any open investigation , it is inappropriate for the public â€™ s patience as we let the facts of the investigation guide us and ensure the integrity of the us , " says the portland 's statement .
