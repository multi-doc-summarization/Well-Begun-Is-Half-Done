a two-headed bull shark foetus has been found in the gulf of mexico , but it 's not clear that the hydra would regrow any head that was chopped off . " i 'm just thinking , 'how many days do we have ? ' and i mean , it 's a blessing that we get to go through this with our children and our family and it 's just something unique and rare , " says brandy e cable , per the bbc . " it 's true that , from time to time , two and even three-headed animals in some way or incorporate them into their culture , " he says . " he has observed rare cases of two-headed specimens in his lab . interestingly , this phenomenon – known as polycephaly – that could allow for this phenomenon . such cases could well have inspired ancient writers of myths . in one telling , the hydra has as many as 50 heads , though several depictions show it with far fewer . but where did this extraordinary idea come from ? could the greeks have got their idea for a multi-headed serpentine ogre from nature itself .
