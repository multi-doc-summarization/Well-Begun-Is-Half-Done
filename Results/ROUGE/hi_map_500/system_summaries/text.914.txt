the diagnosis of a clinic referral , breast cancer , and the week before that the first bad cell split inside me , secretly , and a week , the new york daily news reports . " i 'd became aware of a funny stiffness in a spot on my own body , " he says . " for my friends , for me . solidarity . something small i can do , some little action against the big unknowable that swoops down without warning and strikes the ones we love . i would tweet this new thing , like i do with lots of new things , and when her news came i thought : i need to do this right now . i called my insurance company for a device referral , then dialed a few places on a list the guy in their indian call center emailed . over the phone , the clinics all sounded like places you 'd take a pork chop to be examined , not a human breast , nothing that my waking , speaking mind would grasp as danger . this anomaly must be misplaced anxiety , my logic-brain tried to explain to my lizard-brain ; maybe it 's me wanting to make my friend 's bad news all about me .
