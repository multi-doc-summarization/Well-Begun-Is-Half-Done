german prosecutors said wednesday they have indicted two former nazi ss guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a world war ii concentration camp . both men served as guards at the stutthof concentration camp , located near what is now the polish city of gdansk , dortmund by minnesota fbi agents , were racing to bring to justice war ii-era atrocities , per the ap . the charges , made possible by new german legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former nazis who can â€™ t be tied to specific killings , represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like meisel . members of the ss killed more than 100 polish prisoners and some 77 soviet prisoners of war in the camp 's gas chamber in 1944 . in june , meisel stunned the germans , and her family , when she identified one of the ex-guards , johann rehbogen , as a teenage ss officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning . the men were filed last week at the state court in muenster but only announced wednesday because the defendants first had to be notified .
