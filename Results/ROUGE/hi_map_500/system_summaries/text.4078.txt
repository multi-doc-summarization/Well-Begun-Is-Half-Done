the obama administration will soon have access to the american banking system and that the government would soon offer rules to make it easier for banks to do business with legal marijuana sellers , attorney general eric holder said thursday . " you don ’ t want just huge amounts of cash in these places . they want to be able to use the banking system , " holder said . " there ’ s a public safety component to this . " holder , however , says the attorney general was referring to legal " guidance " for prosecutors and federal law enforcement . " it 's a legal memo to this , huge amounts to cash just kind of lying around with no place for it to be appropriately deposited , is something that would worry me , just from a law enforcement perspective . " the university of virginia 's miller center tells the miller center that the rules are not expected to give banks a green light to accept deposits and provide other services , but would amount to less than the kind of clear safe harbor many banks say they would want before accepting money from pot businesses .
