a former michigan couple who received a wedding gift that instructed them not to open it until their " first disagreement " said they finally opened it 9 years later . kathy gunn said in a post on the love what matters facebook group that she and her husband , brandon , received a gift at their kalamazoo , mich. , wedding from kathy 's great aunt alison . " on the plain white box was a card that read , 'do not open until your 1st disagreement , " he said . " all along , we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage -- 's contents . " gunn 's husband put off opening the box despite their fights because they feared they might one day have a worse " disagreement " and be more in need of the mystery . so , i thought back to our wedding day ( nearly 9 years ago ) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me . the funny thing ? the gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closetâ€¦ unopened .
