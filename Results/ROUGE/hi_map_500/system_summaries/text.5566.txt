" " we saw the asteroid , " he said , adding that it was " a weird quantity of dust blasted into space all at once , " per the guardian . the asteroid has been ejecting dust periodically for at least five months , and the space telescope slewed around and observed the mystery object twice in september . the object , however , says the asteroid is " the entire structure had swung around .
