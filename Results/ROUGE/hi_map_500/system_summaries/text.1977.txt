the afghan government on sunday has set off a deadly chain of events that has not only inflamed tensions but possibly exposed a crippling weakness in the american strategy to wind down the war , reports the bbc . the killing of two high-ranking nato officers by an afghan security official in afghanistan is built around plans to replace large nato combat formations with small teams of advisers who will live and work alongside their afghan partners . on sunday , afghan president hamid karzai , who initially responded to the koran burnings with outrage , sought to stem the latest wave of violence by afghan security forces have turned against nato personnel . some of the killings have been perpetrated by afghan troops on american troops in eastern afghanistan , the latest in a string of incidents in recent months in the country to recall his personnel from top afghan ministries and afghans who felt as though they had suffered an insult to themselves or their faith . the consequences of that erosion of confidence , former u.s. officials and analysts say , could be devastating . “ if the trust , ability and willingness to partner falls apart , you are looking at the endgame here , ” mark jacobson , who served until last summer as the nato deputy senior civilian representative in kabul .
