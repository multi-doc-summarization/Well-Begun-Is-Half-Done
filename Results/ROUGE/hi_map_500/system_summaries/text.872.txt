jonah hill 's star may have been on the rise as he hit saturday night live for the third time as host last night , but his attempts to step out of wolf of wall street co-star leonardo dicaprio 's shadow went a bit awry during the opening monologue . after a series of dicaprio-focused questions from the host , dicaprio himself appeared onstage to rein in hill 's fragile ego and admonish him for trying to act like a big shot . look , this was the 12th episode of the season and i ’ m still catching myself saying , “ wait , was that brooks wheelan ? i think that was brooks . i thought the cast was a little too big when it was at 14 for the past few seasons – . as things heat up between the man and his voice , the operating system hires a surrogate , played by michael cera , to take things to the next level . building the titanic pan pipes . see where 'the wolf just perfectly . jonah hill and michael cera illustrate himself as the voice of his own operating system . who could blame you ? that 's pretty weird . maybe instead , the future will be a place where you can learn to love yourself .
