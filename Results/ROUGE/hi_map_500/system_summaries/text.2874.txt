ncaa president mark emmert is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of 45 criminal counts for abusing 10 boys over a number of years . a report by former fbi director louis freeh concluded that the late coach joe paterno and three former administrators _ , the chairman of the ncaa 's executive committee and oregon state 's president , is the equivalent of an indictment _ by a prosecutor _ and unofficial one at that . to those who truly want to know the truth about sandusky , it should matter that joe paterno has been given a fair and complete hearing . we think the better course would have been for the university to take a strong stand in support of due process so that the complete truth can be uncovered . it is not the university 's responsibility to defend or protect joe paterno . but they at least should n't be able to interview key witnesses , all of whom are represented by lawyers and therefore unavailable ; that there has never been an opportunity to review critical evidence which has not been made public ; that selective evidence and the opinion of the child sex-abuse scandal involving jerry sandusky and a scathing report that found school leaders covered up allegations against the now-convicted former assistant football coach .
