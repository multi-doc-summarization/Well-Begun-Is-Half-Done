two lunch boxes hidden in the toilets of a jet airways plane triggered first a bomb scare and then a smuggling probe as the bags were found to contain 12 gold bars each , a senior customs official tells reuters . smuggling is on the rise into india , one of the world 's biggest buyers of gold , after the government raised import duty to a record 10 percent and slapped restrictions which have shrivelled supplies into the domestic market . he left the plane in mumbai and another passenger removed the gold after it had flown on to goa . customs officials said there had been five cases over two months involving a total 100 kg . " we feel that what we catch is less than 10 percent or so and there are so many groups operating , it is impossible for us to keep a check , " he says . " the flight bars are from dubai for sure . the flight had come from patna to kolkata last , but its basic route is dubai-mumbai. , " per reuters . " you can not carry more than 5 kg of gold and still go undetected , " says an official .
