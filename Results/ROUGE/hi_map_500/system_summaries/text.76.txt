drivers who drink coffee behind the wheel do n't need to worry about getting a ticket in new jersey any time soon . the sponsor of a bill targeting distracted driving says his measure does n't specifically cite coffee , despite recent news reports focusing on the beverage . democratic assemblyman john wisniewski said the legislation is aimed at discouraging distracted driving and that he can not imagine that a police officer would pull anyone over for drinking coffee . current law already prohibits texting or talking without a hands-free device . the new legislation is broader and would bar " any activity unrelated to the actual operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that interferes with the safe operation of the vehicle . " wisniewski says he sponsored the bill , which does n't mention eating or drinking , to avoid the need for new legislation . " there are 3,000 people who did n't make it home , " he said . " the issue is that we need to try , in 2014 there were some 400,000 accidents involving distracted drivers , and 3,000 of those resulted in death.those numbers are shocking , and sadly ! a bill winding its way through the legislature.many are wondering , does this distracted driving bill go too far ? however .
