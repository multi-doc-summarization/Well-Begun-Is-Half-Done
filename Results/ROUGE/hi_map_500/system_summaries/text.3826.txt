india 's silicon valley investor and facebook board member on wednesday took to twitter to apologize for a series of offensive tweets he posted the night before . the world 's second-most populous country , with more than a billion people , was a british colony until 1947 . " i found the comments deeply upsetting , and they do not represent the way facebook or i think at all , " wrote zuckerberg on his facebook page . " we strongly reject the sentiments expressed by marc andreessen last night regarding india . " andreessen 's faux regulatory authority blocked facebook 's free basics , which seeks to bring a limited number of internet sites and services for free to areas of the world where online access is unavailable . the decision was part of a ruling on net neutrality , the principle of equal access to all types of content and services on the internet . facebook , the country concluded , was violating those ideals by picking which services were accessible for free . andreessen , he responded to a tweet that suggested he supports his comments " in full and without reservation .
