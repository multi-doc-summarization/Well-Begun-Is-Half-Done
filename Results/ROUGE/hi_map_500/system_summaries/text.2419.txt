an unexpectedly strong challenge to vermont gov . peter shumlin means the gubernatorial race will be decided by the state legislature in january . democrat incumbent vermont won 49.5 percent of the vote while his republican challenger scott milne has just over 45 percent , the ap reports . the only town missing from the ap 's count was victory , which had a population in 2000 . experts say shumlin 's sub-50 percent showing could reduce momentum behind his signature agenda item , a universal health care system covering all vermonters . the race stayed close for most of the night . under the vermont constitution , candidates for governor , lieutenant governor and treasurer are required to win a minimum of 50 percent plus one to be elected directly . milne says he 's waiting for final figures from the secretary of state 's office . with neither candidate winning more than 50 percent of <unk> , the election goes to the legislature , which nearly always gives the election to the candidate who won the most votes . there have been three exceptions , the last one in 1853 . shumlin was chosen by the legislature for his first two-year-term in 2010 .
