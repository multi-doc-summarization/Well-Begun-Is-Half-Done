a federal advisory board 's recommendation that women in their 40s should avoid routine mammograms is not government policy and has caused " a great deal of confusion , " cnn reports . " keep doing what you have been doing for years : talk to your doctor about your individual history , ask questions and make the decision that is right for you , " a white house source tells cnn . " my message to women is simple . mammograms have always been an important life-saving tool in the fight against breast cancer . as if these two so-called risks were in some way comparable.c ’ mon . we ’ re not that dumb . as an npr reporter i heard put it to a doctor trying to justify it , it ’ s hard to find a woman anywhere who believes the federal panel changed its recommendation for her benefit.it ’ s not that the decision doesn ’ t need to endure the annual indignity indignity of baring their breasts to the radiologist after all . " sebelius , meanwhile , says it 's " making recommendations , not coverage decisions , not payment decisions . "
