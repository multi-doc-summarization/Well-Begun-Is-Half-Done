the new jersey department of banking and insurance , claiming the mandate discriminates against their sexual orientation , are suing the commissioner of the state of new jersey , the bbc reports . " it 's completely discriminatory . it gets us furious every time , because good people come in , and they say we just wanted to have a family and get on with our lives , and do what we have to do , " says a lawyer for the plaintiffs . " we have a medical diagnosis of infertility , and we were denied the medical treatments any heterosexual couple would have if they walked into a fertility clinic . " in a complaint filed last week , the state mandate requires insurance coverage for fertility treatments for heterosexual couples , but not for lesbian couples , reports the wall street journal . the state 's lawsuit , however , says it 's not clear whether the mandate will be a " difficult experience , " and that the law is " not unique . she agrees with them , and says the law has to change . " the agency says the plaintiffs will be " covered , " but that 's not the first time .
