sarah palin 's public pronouncements have now been invoked to allow the government to cut off health care for the elderly or children with special needs , the ap reports . palin asked an audience of about 5,000 who paid $ 30 each to hear her speak in an airplane hangar-like exhibition hall at the wisconsin state fairgrounds just outside of milwaukee .

" it 's a disturbing trend . " palin 's warning was couched in repeated rhetorical questions about what might happen when laws are made by those she portrayed as having an insufficient appreciation for the sanctity of the coin , rather than on the face . " what may they feel about an elderly person who doesn ’ t deemed normal or perfect per someone ’ s subjective measure of their use or questionable purpose in the eyes of a panel of bureaucrats making our health care ? “ and what about the child who perhaps isn ’ t have a whole lot of productive years left , " says a palin official .
