bruno mars owned the grammys with his r & b-inspired album , but winning all six awards he was nominated for at a show where hip-hop was expected to have a historical night . jay-z , the leading nominee with eight , walked away empty handed sunday , a year after his wife lost album of the year to adele , causing fans and peers to criticize the recording academy for not properly rewarding beyonce 's bold " lemonade " project . and though kendrick lamar won five awards , he lost in the top categories , marking another year where rappers were restricted to wins in the rap categories , instead of earning coveted women behind her , including babyface , teddy riley , jimmy jam and terry lewis . lamar 's wins at madison square garden in new york city included best rap album , best rap performance , best rap/sung performance and moved behind him . at one point , lamar 's background dancers , dressed in red , were shot down as he rapped , later coming back to life as fire burst to end the six-minute performance . but mars ' win still marked some growth for the academy : his is one of the few r & b albums to win the top prize .
