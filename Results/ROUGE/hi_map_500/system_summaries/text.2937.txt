cardinal wuerl , the archbishop of washington , will travel to the vatican " in the very near future , to ask pope francis to accept his resignation , a spokesman said . in a letter to priests in the diocese , cardinal wuerl has faced calls for his resignation by some of his priests and parishioners since the release of a bombshell grand jury report on sex abuse in the church found he had reassigned priests who had been accused of abusing children , rather than taking stronger action . the pittsburgh diocese said he will meet with francis about the resignation he presented nearly three years ago at age 75 , the mandatory age for catholic bishops to submit their retirement to the pope . he said a decision about his future " is an essential aspect so that this archdiocesan church we all love can move forward . " the report , meanwhile , says the report is " a new phase , " and that 's not clear whether wuerl is n't the only one of the vatican . " it 's not a lot of the us , " he said . " this is the first time we have to do . "
