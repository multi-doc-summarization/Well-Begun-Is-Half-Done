the study of the new york times calls it a " third party . " that 's what the study calls to be the first study to explore brain physiology in aa members , researchers say . the study , which has been placed in an mri scanner and then shown either pictures of alcoholic drinks or people drinking to simulate drinking behavior in a laboratory setting , reports the bbc . " we wanted to determine what is going on in the brain in response to alcohol-craving triggers , such as passing by a bar or experiencing something upsetting , when long-term aa members are exposed to them , " says a study . " our findings suggest that the experience of aa over the years had left these members with an innate ability to use the aa experience—prayer in this case―to minimize the effect of alcohol triggers in producing craving . " the study also notes that the reduced cravings in those that prayed to increased activity in brain regions responsible for attention and emotion as measured by mri . " craving data revealed that there were changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex , and will not be sold to send unsolicited email , but why this happens remains poorly understood . "
