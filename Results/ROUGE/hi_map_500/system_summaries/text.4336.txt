a confident donald trump told supporters on saturday that he 's not changing his pitch to voters , a day after his chief adviser assured republican officials their party 's front-runner would show more restraint while campaigning . " paul was down in florida and he said , ‘ you know , donald might be changing a little bit over a period of time and he — maybe he ’ ll tone it down , maybe he won ’ t , but who knows what ? ' " trump told a crowd in waterbury , before rejecting this notion . " here , i have to keep you people going . otherwise you 're going to fall asleep on me , right ? " trump declared to the crowd that he has no intention of reversing any of his provocative policy plans , including building a wall along the length of the southern border . " everything i say i 'm going to do , " he said . " i sort of don ’ t like toning it down . " he also told thousands at a rally in bridgeport , connecticut , and later in bridgeport on saturday , mr. trump seemed to view the closed-door pitch his newly installed campaign chief , paul manafort , brought to the republican national committee ’ s spring meeting in florida on thursday . there , in a slide show , mr. manafort assured members that mr. trump was " evolving " and simply playing a part with his incendiary style of campaigning , which has helped drive him to the front of the race but has caused party leaders to worry that republicans will be punished in november .
