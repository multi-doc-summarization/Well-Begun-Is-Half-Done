us researchers say they 've found a way to reverse down syndrome in newborn lab mice by injecting the brain to grow normally , reports the ap . the study in the journal science translational medicine offers no direct link to a treatment for humans , researchers are hopeful it may someday offer a path toward future breakthroughs . the scientists caution that use of the compound , a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog agonist , has not been proven safe to try in people with down syndrome , but say their experiments hold promise for developing drugs like it . this , in turn , leads to intellectual disabilities , distinctive facial features and sometimes other health problems . the team at johns hopkins university used lab mice that were genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half the genes found on human chromosome 21 , leading to down syndrome-like conditions such as smaller brains and difficulty learning to navigate a maze . " most people with future research . like us on facebook down syndrome is a condition that occurs when people have three , rather than the usual two , copies of chromosome 21 . "
