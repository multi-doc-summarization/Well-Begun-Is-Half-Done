the aral sea has been retreating over the last half-century since a massive soviet irrigation project diverted water from the southern aral sea , the new york times reports . " this is something one would have assumed had been done long ago , and was in a textbook somewhere , " says a environmental scientist at umea university in sweden . the lake was at one time fed by the syr darya and amu darya rivers which flow down from the mountains before making their way through the kyzylkum desert where they pooled together at the lowest part of the basin to transform the desert into cotton farms , the bbc reports . the irrigation project started in the year 2000 , which itself had broken up into an eastern and a western lobe , the two sides still barely connected at both ends . the nasa images show how the smaller northern aral sea had separated from the rivers , but it 's not clear whether the lake has increasingly shrunk . the study notes that the lake 's lakes are in places where humans do n't live , but researchers say the lake is " a few medium- to large-size lakes were missing .
