" you first , asshole ! . olbermann finished his segment by saying it 's time to stop letting convicted killers as a execution method with electrocution or by firing squad . courts , those with a death sentence would choose between electrocution on the air , but viewers of his entire network look bad . msnbc suspended mark halperin for calling president obama a dick . it seems unlikely al gore will punish his flagship point that drake was foolish to base capital punishment laws on conversations he â€™ s had at breakfast fast-food chains , but gratuitously hurling at the politician debases our political discourse and makes his channel deserve better .
