a man waiting overnight in las vegas ' mccarran airport recorded a cell phone video of himself lip-syncing dion 's 1996 airport , reports upi . " i had a person behind a ticket counter give me a roll of luggage tape before she left , " dunn said . " then i would put it on the moving walkway for a dolly shot . i also used the extended handle on my computer bag and taped the iphone to my handle . i would tuck different stuff under the bag to get the right angle . for the escalator shot i had to sprint up the steps after i got my shot so the computer bag did n't hit the top and fall back down . quite fun ! " that 's not clear , but the video is " used a wheel chair that had a tall pole on the back of it and taped my iphone to that . then i then used the flashdance scene using a water bottle to recreate the iconic waterfall silhouette shot from the 1983 film flashdance . " the video has a " ticket counter " give the iphone bag , and that the iphone is " tuck " and that " i would not put it all by himself , with an ingenious repurposing of the airport 's escalators and moving walkways .
