the world 's largest physics lab , has addressed results that suggest subatomic particles have gone faster than the speed of light , reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether it will mark the biggest discovery in physics in the past half-century , the ap reports . the team will be met with skepticism all over the world , but the subatomic would be so revolutionary that it ’ s sure to be met by an oddball subatomic . “ i suspect that the bulk of the scientific community will not take this as a definitive result unless it can be reproduced by at least one and preferably several experiments , ” says v. alan kostelecky , a theorist at indiana university , bloomington tells the ap . “ we want to be helped the universe 's ultimate speed limit , and much of modern physics - as laid out in part by albert einstein in his theory of special relativity - depends on the idea that nothing can exceed it . ” if it does n't , the data come from a 1,300-metric-ton particle detector , and the world ’ s theory of the result of light is widely held .
