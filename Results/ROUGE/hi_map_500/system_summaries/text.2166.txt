michael phelps won more medals than anyone else , again . usain bolt kissed the finish line goodbye after enhancing his olympic legacy . simone biles and katie ledecky delivered under the burden of enormous expectations . two strangers went from rivals to forever-linked by a display of kindness , an entire island seemed to celebrate a tennis match , and a gold medalist scampered home to avoid legal issues after a robbery story unraveled . mitchell achieved an historic result in a number of years , australia failed to field an olympic women ’ s gymnastics team in rio . our sole competitor , larissa miller , did her country proud with solid performances on floor and uneven bars but was denied a spot in the finals . simone is a regular olympic games favourite , the gravity-defying tumbles are enough to keep anyone entertained . sadly that money can ’ t buy and humility to match , what could be better ? any chef de mission will tell you that her results are the envy of olympians worldwide . gymnastics 's certainly the best gymnast i ’ ve seen in my lifetime and is bound to be a history-maker and record-breaker .
