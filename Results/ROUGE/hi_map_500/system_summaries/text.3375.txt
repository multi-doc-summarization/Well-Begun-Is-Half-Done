the university of tokyo and kyoto university said friday they have succeeded in creating human ear cartilage from ips cells , the ap reports . in 2011 , a research team from cornell university bioengineered implants using gel and collagen seeded with rat cells that were then made into numerous tiny balls . the researchers say they can use the new technology in treating patients born without ears or with small ears , with a clinical study involving humans expected to start in five years . the project , leaving behind on the animal ’ s back what looks like a 5-centimeter human ear . induced pluripotent stem cells could grow into various human tissues and they are considered promising in the field of regenerative medicine . © kyodo , the researchers who made a human ear and implanted it onto the back of a rat . in about two months , the tubes at the two state-run universities cultured human induced pluripotent cells and electronics called nutrichip to identify foods that cause inflammation . scientists at harvard ’ s wyss institute also made a “ gut-on-a chip ” to mimic the real thing using intestinal cells in a tiny silicon polymer device .
