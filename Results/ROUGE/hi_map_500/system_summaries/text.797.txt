a diner was kicked out of a restaurant not for something she did , but she said online . " if you go to someone 's house and start calling them names , i would n't really expect to stay too much longer after that , " she says . " now , the way you show you 're enjoying it is that you tweet about it . you post it on facebook . you have that other dimension of depth , the twitterverse . but just as quickly as they could say something offensive and negative . " the customer is allison hiromi , and she called the bar a " twerp " on twitter , and the manager showed her to leave . " any business is allowed to set the tone of their establishment , " cusack said in a statement , per the new york daily news . " i do n't think it 's become not only de rigeur but almost necessary for a restaurant to have a twitter account . it 's not enough now to have just a website or just a facebook page : customers want to interact with their friends , namecheck hot restaurants and call out establishments that are n't up to par .
