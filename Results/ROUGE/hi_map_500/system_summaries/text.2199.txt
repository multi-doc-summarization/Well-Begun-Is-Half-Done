president trump tweeted the senate to change its " skinny revision repeal bill through the budget reconciliation process , meaning the measure only needed a 51-vote majority . " trump tweeted , " if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate , they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority , not senseless 60 , " he said in a tweet . " even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51 , some really good things need 60 . so many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes . " the president has called for a change to senate rules so that 51 votes are needed to pass legislation instead of 60 % , reports the washington post . the senate has n't been able to pass the bill , but it 's not clear whether republicans will be a " 51-vote majority " to the senate . " if you 're going to do this , we 're not a lot of people who do n't have to do so , " trump said , adding that the senate should do so " the senate will get rid of the legislative filibuster multiple times before , and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has expressed no interest in the change .
