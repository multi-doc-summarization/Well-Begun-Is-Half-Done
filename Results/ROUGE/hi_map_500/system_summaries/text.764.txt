larry w. bush and vice president dick cheney shared a stage together tuesday for the first time since the two left office , showering each other with praise as they reflected on the legacy of their administration and the decision to run for office together . the two men united for the groundbreaking of the $ 300 million bush presidential library on the southern methodist university campus in dallas . hundreds of bush administration alumni , including former secretary of state condoleeza rice and first lady laura bush , also attended . bush has said the library and affiliated george w. bush policy institute will be " the focus of our attention and forum for our public service " for the rest of his life . he appeared much thinner and more hesitant in his gait , and he used a cane to walk , although he put it aside when it came time to approach the lectern . " two years after your tour at the white house ended , cheney said to bush , who has been one of the most ardent and outspoken defenders of the administration , appeared gaunt and frail in what was a rare public appearance since having heart surgery in july . it was also largely seen as vehicles through which bush can continue to shape his presidential legacy .
