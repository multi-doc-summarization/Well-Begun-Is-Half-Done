the world 's largest solar-powered boat has crossed the world aboard a ship powered entirely by solar energy , reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether he 'll prove to the world that there are other alternatives to powering sea travel besides fossil fuels and wind . " we have shown that we have the technologies as well as the knowledge to become sustainable and safeguard our blue planet , " domjan said in a statement . " it would also demonstrate just what solar power is capable of . in 2008 he formed a partnership with german entrepreneur immo stroeher , who helped provide the funds to make this idea possible . still , the voyage dovetails with some rethinking solar cells that feed power to six blocks of lithium-ion batteries . " the ship , however , is made of a durable lightweight carbon material and is covered with 38,000 batteries , notes the washington post . " each new sunrise provides the catamaran with the light needed to continue , " he said , adding that it would be " an adventure and a test concept rather than something to be replicated for wide commercial use .
