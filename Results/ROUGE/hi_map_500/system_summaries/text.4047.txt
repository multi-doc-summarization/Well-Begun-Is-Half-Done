president trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care , the ap reports . the white house in a statement thursday night said that based on guidance from the justice department , the department of health and human services has expanded private insurance to millions of people through the creation of marketplaces , also known as exchanges , where people can purchase plans , in many cases using government subsidies in his most aggressive move yet to undermine his predecessor 's health care law . the subsidies , which are worth an estimated $ 7 billion this year and are paid out in monthly installments , may stop almost immediately , since congress hasn said they had not yet decided which federal and state rules would apply to the new products . without changing the law , they said , they can rewrite federal regulations so that more health plans would be exempt from some of its requirements . the trump proposal “ would draw younger and healthier people away from the exchanges and drive additional plans out of the market , ” says the chief executive of the alliance of community health plans .
