it 's not a joke , but it 's a <unk> crush . the memo , which has been shared on social media , has informed the staff of a seizure of flashing lights , which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy at certain intensities , the new york times reports . " 'incredibles 2 ' contains a sequence of people with epilepsy , exposure , and with certain visual patterns , can trigger seizures , " mencia says . " there are multiple scenes in this movie with full-screen , black-and-white flashing strobe effects . they all happen without warning , and last anywhere between a fully-lit room , with someone with you who will be able to help if the strobe effects do trigger a seizure . please stay safe . update : after talking to some people who have loved ones with severe epilepsy , i would highly recommend you do not see the incredibles 2 in theaters . wait until the movie 's released on digital/bluray , and my immediate thought was how disasterously unsafe this movie is for my photosensitive epilepic friends . @ markingatlightspeed i â€™ m tagging you with this specifically because i feel that this would be extremely dangerous for you to watch .
