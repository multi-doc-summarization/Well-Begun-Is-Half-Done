sienna miller was today expected to become the latest public figure to join the legal assault on scotland yard and the news of the world reporter at the centre of phone hacking allegations , reports the new york daily news . " an interview under caution would follow someone being arrested as a suspect , except in the most exceptional circumstances , " says a police spokesman . " the committee was asked to look into the issue of mps phones being hacked following a commons vote last week . the committee now says it will not look into specific cases - such as alleged hacking of mps ' phones by the world journalists - but instead question experts on whether hacking amounts to contempt of parliament . if the committee decides that phone hacking does not amount to contempt it would be expected to hold only a brief inquiry , and would be unlikely to call any witnesses from the news . however . the legal moves came after miller , 28 , had procured her mobile phone numbers , account number and secret pin code , needed to intercept the voicemail of the minority of people who change the factory settings on their phones .
