rescue crews are searching indonesian waters for airasia indonesia flight 8501 , which disappeared sunday with 162 passengers and crew onboard . the plane was flying from surabaya , indonesia 's second-largest city , and was about halfway to its destination , singapore , when it vanished from radar . ___ and helicopters scour the waters off indonesia 's coast for missing airasia flight qz8501 , there have been several reports of possible signs of the missing plane . so far , officials say , none of them have panned out . on tuesday , search teams will be checking the area where indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke , the head of search and rescue in the province of bangka-belitung told cnn indonesia . " our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea , " he said . " authorities do n't know whether there 's any connection to the missing jet . " the plane has played a role in past air disasters that occurred at cruise elevation , including the 2009 air france flight 447 crash over the atlantic ocean . another possibility is some type of catastrophic metal fatigue caused by the cycle of pressurization and depressurization associated with each takeoff and landing cycle .
