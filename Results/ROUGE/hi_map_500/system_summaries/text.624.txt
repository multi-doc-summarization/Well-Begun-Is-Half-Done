a house committee killed legislation that would have effectively repealed the law passed in 2011 that allowed for-profit virtual schools to operate in tennessee , the ap reports . stewart told the committee that tennessee virtual academy , part of a system of virtual schools operated around the nation by k12 inc. , has proved itself in a year of operation a " bad idea " for both its students , who have had low scores in testing , and for taxpayers . " that is not something i would ever be told in my school -- i mean , it 's just not acceptable , " said state rep. gloria johnson , a knoxville democrat who is also a career teacher . " after ... looking at so many failing grades , we need to make some changes before the holidays , " the email begins . the email suggests that even school leaders are becoming increasingly concerned by how their students ' grades may look to parents and the public . " the only people that are benefiting are in k12 , a virginia corporation that is rising statewide test results that put it among the worst schools in the state . in fact , the 2011 bill was sponsored by rep. harry brooks , r-knoxville , who is now chairman of the house education committee and sponsor of the haslam administration bill changing some new restrictions on virtual schools , but only after eliminating the school , using millions of taxpayer dollars .
