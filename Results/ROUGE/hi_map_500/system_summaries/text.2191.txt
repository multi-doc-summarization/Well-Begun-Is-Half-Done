" obviously , he means he ’ s a serious conservative , and he was trying to defend himself , or portray himself as such , but i don ’ t know exactly what he was meaning by that . " cnn reports cnn 's " state of the union " host candy crowley , who has said to be a " straight face , " says he did n't think there was anything wrong with party conservatives . " you have to talk to the romney campaign and how many tickets they bought , we 've heard all sorts of things , " santorum says . " we did n't do that , we do n't try to tell us exactly what it means . i do n't pay them to turn out . " he added , " i think i share your interest in that , because that was the first time i ’ ve heard that definition , so i guess mitt will have the same objective , they will have to speak for themselves [ but ] for their tickets , and they come in and vote and they leave .
