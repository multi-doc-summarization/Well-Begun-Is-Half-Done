george doodnaught was sentenced to 10 years in prison tuesday for what a judge called " reprehensible " sexual assaults on 21 sedated women during surgeries , reports the ap . " it must be condemned in the strongest , " he said . " in several cases [ doodnaught ] compounded his victims ' sense of violation and humiliation by manipulating them to try to make them believe they were somehow responsible – that they had initiated sexual contact or had engaged in sexually explicit conversations , " the judge says . " the profound psychological impact of the physical violations has been compounded by the victims ' deep feelings of betrayal – that these offences were committed during surgery , by a medical doctor , in an operating room , a place of ultimate vulnerability and trust , " says george doodnaught , 65 , who was found guilty of sexually assaulting 21 women between the ages of 25 and 75 while they were semi-conscious on the operating table . all but one of the women were undergoing surgeries at north york general hospital between 2006 and 2010 . doodnaught was a popular anesthesiologist at the hospital for 26 years .
