the council 's decision is part of a broader national effort to raise its minimum wage to $ 15 an hour on tuesday , as a wage increase bill passed the city council by a vote of 14-1 . it is now up to city attorney mike feuer to draft an ordinance to implement the new minimum wage requirements . the ordinance will then return to the council for a final vote before becoming law . under the proposed legislation , the city ’ s minimum wage would increase to $ 10.50 in july 2016 , and would increase incrementally every year until it reaches $ 15 in july 2020 . for small businesses with 25 or fewer employees , the wage hike would come on a modified schedule with the incremental increases starting in july 2017 and that higher pay scales would improve the way of life for the region ’ s vast low-wage work force . " the proposal will bring wages up in a way we haven ’ t seen since the 1960s , " says ruben gonzalez , an economist at the university of california , berkeley , who was commissioned by city leaders to conduct several studies on the potential effects of a minimum-wage increase .
