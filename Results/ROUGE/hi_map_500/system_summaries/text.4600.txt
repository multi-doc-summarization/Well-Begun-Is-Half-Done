the british government is making urgent preparations to cope with the fallout of a possible greek exit from the single currency , the new york times reports . the greek president , however , says it 's " tearing to the rest of europe , " the bbc reports . " in the event of an exit , they ( greece ) will default . and the loss given default will probably be very high , high enough to eliminate the ecb 's capital , " says andrew bosomworth , senior portfolio manager at greek banks . " the loss of the burden other euro zone states could bear gives them a powerful incentive to keep greece in the currency club . with most of greek 's private creditors having taken heavy writedowns as part of the country 's second , 130 billion euros bailout , it is estimated that the ecb , international monetary fund and euro zone nations hold approaching 200 billion of its debt . " tsipras , meanwhile , notes that greece has accused the eu and german chancellor angela merkel , and it 's not clear whether the ecb is " tearing the fragile american recovery . "
