evolution and genetics seem to have baked a certain amount of murder into humans as a species , but civilization has tamed some of the savage beast in us , according to a new study . scientists calculated the rate at which more than 1,000 mammal species kill their own kind , and noticed how closely related species have similar rates of lethal violence . researchers from spain have found that a tendency to bump off members of the same species is particularly common among primates , and have estimated that around 2 % of human deaths at the origin of our species were down to such lethal spats . " what it is saying , in the broadest terms , is that humans have evolved strategies for solving problems with violence , " says mark pagel , professor of evolutionary biology at the university of reading , who was not involved in the research . humans are " in a position within a particularly violent mammalian clade , in which violence seems to have been ancestrally present , " the study in the journal nature says . " at least to some extent , the way humans organise in societies influences our levels of lethal violence. . "
