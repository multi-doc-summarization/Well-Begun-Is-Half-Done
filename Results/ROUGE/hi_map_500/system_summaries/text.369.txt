the universe is expanding 5 % to 9 % faster than expected , the new york times reports . the european space agency jointly announced the hubble space telescope to measure the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy , reports the wall street journal . " this surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " says a spokesman for the space telescope science institute and the johns hopkins university , both in baltimore , maryland . the results will appear in an upcoming issue in the astrophysical journal , which notes that the rate of expansion is expanding at a faster pace than previously predicted . " it is a discovery that could test part of albert einstein â€™ s theory of relativity , a pillar of cosmology , or the hubble constant , is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec , " the study said .
