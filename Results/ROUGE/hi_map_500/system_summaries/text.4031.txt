twelve people were killed on friday in the bloodiest day yet in protests that have raged across afghanistan over the desecration of copies of the muslim holy book at a nato base , reuters reports . the german military , which handed over security responsibility for the taloqan area to afghan authorities on feb. 15 , had originally planned to shut down its base there altogether in 2014 . hundreds of afghans marched toward the palace of afghan president hamid karzai in kabul , while afghan army helicopters circled above . friday is a holy day and the official weekly holiday in afghanistan and mosques in the north _ which led to injuries but no deaths _ that the 50 remaining german soldiers should pull back to a larger base in kunduz immediately . paris says the soldiers already have made the roughly 43-mile ( 70-kilometer ) transfer to kunduz and have taken most material from the taloqan outpost . germany has nearly 4,800 troops in northern afghanistan . the angry demonstrations were to be expected in a religious country fed up with foreigners , but the tension this week seems more pervasive and irresolvable than in the past . “ the big question is , how long does it go on ? you have to watch who jumps on the bandwagon . it is very intense , and there ’ s the feeling that all areas need to have had their own demonstration if they haven , " he said .
