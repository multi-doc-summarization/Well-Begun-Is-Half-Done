twin car bombs struck intelligence and security buildings in the syrian capital on saturday , killing at least 27 people and wounding nearly 100 , according to state media . " i woke up to two massive explosions around 7:30 this morning - one was on baghdad street less than a mile away from my home , " a witness in damascus told al jazeera . " relatives closer to the explosion told me their windows were blown out and doors destroyed from the blast . " bassma , a paris-based member of the opposition syrian national council , says she doubted the armed groups trying to bring assad down by force have the capacity to carry out such attacks on security institutions in the capital . " all our windows and doors are blown out , " said majed , 29 , who lives in the area . " the blasts were the latest in a string of mysterious , large-scale attacks targeting the syrian regime 's military and security installations . the previous blasts , all suicide bombings , killed dozens of people since december , even as the regime wages a bloody crackdown against the year-old uprising against president bashar al-assad .
