the annual canadian ufo survey was released monday , showing an increase in reports in 2015 compared to 2014 in canada and manitoba . " overall in canada , there was a slight increase in the number of ufo reports , and it 's at the second highest level of sightings that we 've recorded since we started doing the survey back in the 1980s , " says chris rutkowski , a science writer who compiled this year 's survey . " we 're very puzzled because we do n't hear a lot about ufos anymore although the ufo sightings continue to come in … in 2015 . there was an unusual number of cases from quebec , in fact three or four times . " rutkowski said the survey of strange stories includes dozens of unexplained lights , aircraft shaped like discs and diamonds , silently hovering ufos and a few close encounters of the third kind . in 2015 , there were 1,267 reported sightings of ufos , second only to 1,981 in 2012 . " that ranges from reports from b.c . right across to newfoundland , " he said . " they come from every demographic … and all parts of canada . "
