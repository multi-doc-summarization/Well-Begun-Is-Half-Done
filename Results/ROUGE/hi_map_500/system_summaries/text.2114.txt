the iran military base in iran on nov. 12 , which iranian authorities have called an accident that set back research work there by a few days , appears to have been far more devastating than their description suggested , according to an analysis of newly released commercial satellite images of the blast site , reports the new york times . iran was apparently performing a volatile procedure involving a missile engine at the site when the blast occurred as iran had achieved a major milestone in the development of a new missile . " it was pretty amazing to see that the entire facility was destroyed , " paul brannan , the report 's author , said . " there were only a few buildings left standing. . " the report notes that the blast was released by the iranian government , which has become increasingly sensitive about its military capabilities as tensions escalate with the west over its missile and nuclear programs . the institute for science and international security , a private group in washington , made the satellite images public monday , along with an act of sabotage . the force of the explosion was so great that it shook windows in many surrounding towns , and a considerable amount of debris is still present . about the same number of trucks are visible in the november 22 , 2011 image likely resulted from subsequent controlled demolition of buildings and removal of debris . there do not appear to be many pieces of heavy equipment such as cranes or dump trucks on the site ,
