" i was really proud of j.j. and how quickly he got involved and how hard he worked to make all of this happen , " cuban told espn in a text message . " mark gave him our team plane . they loaded up a bunch of stuff , supplies , and they 're going to turn around and come back . he 's going to take his mom and grandmother back with him , and my understanding is his dad is going to stay over there and slug it out with all of the recovery efforts . " barea , the nba 's only active player who is a native puerto rican , did not have any communication with his parents until sunday . " that 's a situation that he 's got to take care of , " coach rick carlisle says . " but it 's still rough there . " he said he 's hoping to either bring his parents to dallas or go visit and help family and friends sometime in the near future . barea 's fundraiser has generated more than $ 140,000 . barea and his wife , viviana ortiz , organized an online fundraiser after hurricane maria devastated their homeland last wednesday , when it hit puerto rico as a category 4 storm with 155 mph winds . the storm caused major flooding and knocked out electricity and phone service throughout the island , much of which is expected to be without power for months .
