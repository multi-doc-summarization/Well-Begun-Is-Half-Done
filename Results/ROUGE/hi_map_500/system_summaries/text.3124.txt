the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of the west antarctic ice sheet , where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years , the ap reports . the paper 's lead author brent christner says the discovery of the ice sheet becomes a floating ice shelf . the discovery raises the obvious question of what other extreme environments called archaea , which convert ammonium and methane into energy to survive and grow . " we were able to prove unequivocally to the world that antarctica is not a dead continent , " priscu said in a release . similar expeditions have found sub-ice environments with bacteria in recent years , but questions have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process . the whillans ice stream subglacial access research drilling project , and in topographic depressions there are hundreds of lakes , both large and small ; some are isolated , but many are interconnected by water channels and large areas of saturated sediments , the water eventually running out into the southern ocean as the freezing point , even in the extreme cold of antarctica .
