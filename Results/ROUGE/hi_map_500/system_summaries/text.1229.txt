the families of two teenage boys who went missing while fishing off the coast of florida pleaded for help monday , asking people to scour the shores for debris or any clues that might lead to their sons . the 19-foot white single-engine boat that austin stephanos and perry cohen , both 14 , took out off the shore of jupiter late last week was found sunday , roughly 67 miles off on friday . there was no sign of the teens in the boat , according to the coast guard . " they could be anywhere from 60 to 180 miles away from where they started , just as a function of where they were in the gulf stream , " perry 's stepfather , said monday . " then if it ’ s only a quarter of a mile-per-hour difference , now you ’ re moving twice as fast , " he said . " we want everybody , once again , from palm beach all the way up the coast , to get on down there and look for anything off . you get to be 2 to 3 miles apart , and then you start getting 15 to 20 miles apart .
