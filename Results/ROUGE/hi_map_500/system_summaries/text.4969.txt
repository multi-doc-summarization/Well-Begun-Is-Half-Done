joe mcginniss is a particular sort of journalist unfortunately not so in vogue anymore . his own obsessiveness and personal involvement invariably become part of the story . in his book about the 1968 presidential election , the selling of the most seminal campaign books ever written , he managed to inject himself as a constant shadow presence in the nixon camp and wrote the model for fly-on-the-wall journalism as well as the basic tragedy that we have so supported president obama in his campaign and are supportive of him now , i do n't know why the question is n't asked by the mainstream media and by others if there 's any connection there to president obama taking so doggone long to get in there , to dive in there and grasp the complexity and the support by the oil companies to the administration . why was the expert group assembled by energy commissioner steven chu only set up three weeks after the administration asked the department of defense for help in deploying equipment needed for the extreme depth spill site ? why did it take nine whole days before the start of an author 's tangled for all future media consultants . his account in fatal vision of jeffrey mcdonald 's murder of his pregnant wife and two children is a classic in crime reporting and , as well , one of the stranger tales of journalism , the journalist 's tangled relationship with and dogged pursuit of his subject.mcginniss 's hyper-involvement with his stories has bedeviled his subjects , publishers , and critics ( janet malcolm â€™ s famous study of journalism ) .
