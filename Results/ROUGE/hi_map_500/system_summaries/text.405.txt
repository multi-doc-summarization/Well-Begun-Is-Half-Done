the new york mets have settled with trustee irving picard for $ 162 million , their alleged profit from certain ponzi scheme funds in the six years before bernard madoff 's arrest . in reality , fred wilpon and family will be on the hook for only a fraction of that amount -- and will not be required to make any payments until 2016 and 2017 . that if picard pays to victims 50 cents on the dollars they lost . that means the wilpons could be credited $ 89 million in losses from certain funds . obviously , like any victims of madoff 's ponzi scheme , they wo n't recover every dollar . but they will get a certain percentage based on how much the trustee collects from net winners -- likely 50 percent or more . as a result , the wilpons will be able to apply to the trustee to be reimbursed for $ 178 million to pay picard to satisfy the settlement . that 's a net of only $ 73 million ( half of $ 178 . ) the lawsuit was removed from bankruptcy court , and jed s. rakoff of the united states district court , who took over the case , both reduced mr. picard â€™ s financial claims and raised the legal bar he would have to clear in order to collect .
