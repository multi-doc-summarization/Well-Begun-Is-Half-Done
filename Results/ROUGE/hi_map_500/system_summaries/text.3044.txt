robert e. andrews is resigning from congress after 23 years in washington , and he 's not a bill on capitol hill . " i ’ m just a bill , " he said , adding that he would resign in two weeks , taking a position at the law firm dilworth paxson . andrews , 56 , said tuesday that he was " the classic idea of how lawmaking works , that is a vast array of bills , covering a vast number of subjects have ever passed the house of representatives . but none of them passed the senate , so none made it to the president ’ s desk . even in congress . they didn ’ t become law . only four of andrews ’ s hundreds of ideas that might have little to do with one another . what looks like failure , andrews said , is now done with massive pieces of legislation crammed on licorice . but all of andrews 's bills had one thing in common . " the new york times notes that andrews has been a " bill sings , " and that " the debate ends with a vote — does not mean much on today 's least successful lawmaker of the past two decades . "
