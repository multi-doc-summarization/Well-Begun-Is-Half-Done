the labor department on friday reported december jobs gains were much lower than expected as the year ended , the ap reports . the disappointing department says the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in november to 6.7 percent , the lowest level since october 2008 . the government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively searching for work . cold weather may have slowed hiring . construction firms cut 16,000 jobs , the biggest drop in 20 months . december 's hiring is far below the average gain of 214,000 jobs a month in the preceding sector , but that was because more people dropped out of the workforce rather than found new jobs . other strong gains came from the wholesale trade industry ( 15,000 ) and professional and business services ( 19,000 new jobs ) , and the average work week for private employees edged down to 34.4 hours last month from the prior month . but the drop occurred partly because more americans stopped looking for jobs . the federal government â€™ s workforce continued to shrink , with 7,000 fewer positions last month , nearly matching the previous two years .
