a middle-school teacher who took to facebook to vent her frustration with the perceived bad behavior of students and parents has struck a nerve with her now-viral post , reports the bbc . " i have already made the decision to leave teaching at the end of this year , and today , i do n't know if i will make it even that long , " she said . " sometimes i have students even coming and getting things off of my desk , just taking things that do n't belong to them. . " she says she 's not fair to society , and their children are even worse. . " it 's a problem that 's going to spread through our society like wildfire , " he said , adding that the post has been shared more than 400,000 times and drawn dozens of comments . the photos show books astray , papers left on the floor and a book that appears to be torn apart . she also wrote on facebook about expecting to hear from parents after sending out report cards , while not hearing from them during the weeks and weeks of assignments leading up to the progress reports .
