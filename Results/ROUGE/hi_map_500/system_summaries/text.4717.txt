three doctors will face a criminal trial in belgium accused of failing to comply with the legal conditions for euthanasia , the first such case since it was decriminalised in 2002 . " this is the first time that there has been a decision to refer such a case to a court of law , " says her sister , adriana geerts , per afp . " there have already been legal cases involving doctors , but they have always resulted in dismissals before going to court . " the case follows the announcement that dutch authorities are prosecuting a doctor for euthanising an elderly woman with dementia in the first case of its kind in neighbouring the netherlands . belgium and the netherlands became the first countries in the world to legalise so-called mercy killing , but it can only be brought to the other side with a simple injection , reports the ap . the case has taking more than 20 pills every day , including antidepressants , an opioid , a tranquilizer , and two medicines often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia . about a year later , on october 7 , 2014 , her doctor administered a lethal dose of drugs . it was all legal procedure in belgium , which has among the world â€™ s most permissive euthanasia laws .
