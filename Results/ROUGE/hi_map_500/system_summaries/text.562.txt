audi is introducing an industry-first system that tells drivers how long it will take for a traffic light to change from red to green . the carmaker , which allows the cars to receive traffic light information in areas that have centralized control , will roll out city by city . the system is available on the 2017 q7 suv and a4 sedan built after june 1 . drivers must opt for the connect prime service , which costs with traffic data , to see if it makes sense to instead turn right and take a different street . audi is also pitching this as a benefit of having technology built directly into the car , rather than coming from apple or google via a phone . “ it ’ s information like this that allows your mind to relax , ” audi general manager pom malhotra said in a briefing with reporters in san francisco . " this is not an app , " malhotra says , per the washington post . " these are all enhancements we are looking at with this technology . " audi , who will be part of audi , will be first .
