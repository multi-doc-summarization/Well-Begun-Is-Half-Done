the wall street journal editorial board accused mitt romney of being a technocrat and not a conservative . in his speech in ann arbor , mich. , romney proved the editorial board correct , the new york daily news reports . " i greatly respect governor romney and admire many of his personal and professional accomplishments , but his work to institute the precursor to national socialized medicine is not one of them . both romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government ’ s healthcare cost burden . romneycare has , in fact , not made healthcare better or saved costs in massachusetts . it was really two speeches . the first was a defense of romneycare . but it was one that will only deepen conservative criticism . romney proudly defended his plan and the individual mandate that is unique to that state . if there are no important differences between the massachusetts health-care system and that of other states , " he said . " it ’ s done just the opposite . " romney has claimed to believe that the mandate is " a good idea , despite the object of the entire republican party ’ s ire . "
