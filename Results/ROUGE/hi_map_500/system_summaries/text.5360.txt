jon stewart 's rally to restore sanity is " a nice set , " he says . " you ran on very high rhetoric , hope and change , and the democrats this year seem to be running on , ‘ please baby , one more chance , ' " stewart said in a statement . " it ’ s fantastic for the united states and you take your campaign get-out-the-vote to a fake news program , but managing to not be very funny together for the show 's entire 22 minutes ( plus a platform of “ yes we can , given certain conditions. . " ) and , as the washington post points out , the show has been " <unk> , " and that the show is " an entertainer and , just as when glenn beck led a rally on the mall , this rally will be all about him and his comedy central partner stephen colbert . " stewart , meanwhile , says it 's not clear whether he 's been a " rally . " obama , however , says he 's not " <unk> " that he does n't think it 's " the daily show with jon stewart . "
