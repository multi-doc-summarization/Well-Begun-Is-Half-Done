scott 's new vice president , white vice president michael sata , is of scottish descent , becomes africa 's first white head of state for many years , the ap reports . scott , who has been treated at london 's king edward vii hospital where he died in the uk aged 77 after receiving treatment for an undisclosed illness . the first was the peaceful nature of the regime . there were two remarkable aspects to last october 's election , in which the patriotic front party was voted in , ending the former government ’ s 20-year rule . sirens heralding scott ’ s arrival are another novelty , but he insists they are used only sparingly . except on visits to his own constituency , he jokes , when they introduced me as vice president . it is the first time in independent africa ( zambia gained its independence in 1964 joining the mmd which won the first multiparty elections the next year as agricultural minister he oversaw the recovery from a devastating drought in 1992/93 he joined michael sata ) . the other was the colour ahead of us as we glide through the capital .
