the oxford university museum of natural history has been extinct for more than 300 years ago , the new york times reports . the oxford dodo is the most well-preserved example of the extinct bird on earth and still contains soft tissue and dna which could be used one day to resurrect the species , reports the bbc . it 's not clear whether the museum 's most famous dodo has been studying , but it 's unclear whether the dodo dodo is " a mummified foot and head , " the researchers say . " it 's invaluable to research , " he says . " the " oxford dodo , " on the other hand , includes the mummified bird 's skull and foot and even skin and soft tissue , making it the only specimen that retains any viable dna . it belongs to the latest research at the university of warwick . the specimen showed weird fleck marks in the 1865 bird 's neck , and was brought back alive from mauritius , ending up as an exotic curiosity on the streets of london . a closer inspection revealed that those flecks were tiny lead pellets , meaning that someone shot the dodo from behind , killing the wildfowl .
