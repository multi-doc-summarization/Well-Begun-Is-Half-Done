the daily hustle got you down on the greek island of syros is looking to hire a live-in caretaker , reports a new york times . " paid job offer with cats ! ( this is genuine and not a joke â€” friends , please feel free to verify ! ) , " the posting reads . " a very special position and living circumstance on offer on a little greek island called syros ( a small paradise no less ! " ) . " they are small enough to sit on your cold feet without cutting into your already questionable circulation . they are sometimes filled with grief and call because they miss having a shy or traumatized cat to be adopted out with young children while others may not . sometimes it is better to personally know each cat in order to find the " purrfect " home . " it is my not so humble opinion that god outdid himself when he created cats . it is a cat prefers to be the only cat in the house ! quite a few calls i receive at resqcats are from people who have just lost their beloved furry friend through death . they appreciate what you do for them by purring and rubbing against you as you do it .
