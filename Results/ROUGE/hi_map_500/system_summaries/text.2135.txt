a new website from wolfram alpha will attempt to identify any image you show it , though it 's a pretty fair assessment , but it 's not clear that the site will spend a few seconds mulling it over before taking a guess at what the picture is showing . " it won ’ t always get it right , but most of the time i think it does remarkably well , " wolfram writes . " and to me what ’ s particularly fascinating is that when it does get something wrong , the mistakes it makes mostly seem remarkably human . " in some brief testing , stephen wolfram is " no good at identifying tech products , " and " it 's designed to identify anything in a picture . you just upload a photo , then cross reference that with a database of flights , including their altitude , angle , and even their flight number and aircraft type . but in my experience , those flashes of flower from a hike in los angeles ( larkspur ) . it also does pretty well identifying simpler things , like the pizza photo i used in a wednesday blog post . wolfram ’ of the most amazing things you can do with wolfram alpha is ask it what planes are overhead .
