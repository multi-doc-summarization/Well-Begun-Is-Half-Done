a new utah law could charge women with homicide if they miscarry , making women 's rights advocates concerned that women will be brought up on murder charges for drinking , failing to wear a seatbelt , or falling down the stairs . the bill passed utah 's state legislature last thursday and still needs final approval by the governor , but it continues to gain attention this week for its unusually restrictive language , the ap reports . the basis for the law was a recent case in which a 17-year-old girl , who was seven months pregnant , paid a man $ 150 to beat her in an attempt to cause a miscarriage . although the bill does not affect legally obtained abortions , it criminalizes any actions taken by women to induce a miscarriage ? under the new law such actions could be cause for prosecution . women might also make themselves open to prosecution in prison for an " intentional , knowing , or reckless act " that leads to a miscarriage or abortion without a doctor 's supervision . especially concerning to some utah democrats and many women 's supervision activists is the word " reckless " writing for rh reality check , rachel larris says .
