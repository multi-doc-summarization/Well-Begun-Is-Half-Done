if you 're going to be a common ingredient in the sun , it 's not the only one thing to do so . the new york times reports that the sun 's birth is older than the sun . it 's a sip , but the sun has n't yet to do with the water , but it 's " a high deuterium content can only form under specific conditions , " says a paper in the university of exeter and astronomy department . " by identifying the ancient heritage of earth ’ s water , we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique , and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water . " the sun notes that the water " is so old bodes well for our hunt for wet environments here , but , even so , scientists don ’ t have definitive answers for how or when the water got here — or , for life , elsewhere in the same cloud of dust from which the sun would form ? or did water come later , forming as the earth also formed ? as the washington post explains , during the sun ’ s birth a band of unused space dust gathered like skirt hems around it to go it alone in stirring up its own water . scientists know that some of our water must predate the solar system ’ s planets , and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did , that means that water might be in the protoplanetary disk .
