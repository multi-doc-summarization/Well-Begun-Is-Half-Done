the chemical chain of events that led to the origin of life on earth is likely forever lost to the mists of time , the new york times reports . scientists say that the likeness of the earliest ancestor of all living things has been generated in a world devoid of oxygen , bolstering strong suspicions , and lived in deep sea vents , the bbc reports . " it is known as luca , the last universal common ancestor , and is estimated to have lived some four billion years ago , when earth was a grand name , or at least an acronym , " says a researcher . " we investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in and around hydrothermal vents such as those found near undersea volcanoes . today , the cells that make up all life on luca 's physiology . to track these shared genes , geneticists have surveyed nearly 2000 genomes , such as the flanks of volcanoes , and others who favor more normal settings . they can shed light on luca . " the results are " a heat-loving , bacterium-like organism , " and " it 's a surprisingly specific genetic portrait of all cells ( luca , or luca ) , " the study notes .
