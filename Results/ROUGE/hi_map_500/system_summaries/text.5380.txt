the texas state board of education approved a resolution today that requires publishers to correct a " pro-islamic/anti-christian bias " in future world history textbooks.the resolution , which narrowly passed 7-6 , cites instances of an alleged emphasis on unfavorable events in christian history as told in school textbooks , while claiming that the resolution is not legally binding on publishers , but does state the will of board members to have more balanced social studies books . opponents , who tried to derail the resolution with a series of parliamentary maneuvers , called the proposal a waste of time that will further undermine the reputation of the board . " what we 're trying to do is prohibit and send a clear message to the publishers that [ the bias ] should not happen in the future , " miller said in a statement . " it is hard not to be . " board members rejected numerous opportunities today to pass a resolution that called on publishers to treat all religions with balance and accuracy in their textbooks , per the new york times . " this resolution will ensure upfront that potential biases are taken care of before these books reach the board , " he said .
