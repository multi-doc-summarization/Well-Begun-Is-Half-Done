a federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law , the ap reports . scott walker on friday , bans doctors from performing abortions if they do n't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice , per the bbc . " there will almost certainly be irreparable harm to those women who will be foreclosed from having an abortion in the next week either because of the undue burden of travel or the late stage of pregnancy , as well as facing increasing health risks caused by delay , " the judge wrote . " since the state has failed to date to demonstrate any benefit to maternal health of imposing this restriction , there is no meaningful counterweight recognized by the united states supreme court to justify the act 's immediate enforcement . " conley 's ruling does not affect a separate provision of the new law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound . at next week , the law , which took effect monday , also requires women to have an ultrasound before getting next week . conley agreed , however , " there is a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges requirement .
