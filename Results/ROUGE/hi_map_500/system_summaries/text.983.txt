drivers in california can legally read a map on their hand-held cellphones while behind the wheel , a state appeals court ruled thursday . the 5th district court of appeal reversed the case of a fresno man who was ticketed in january 2012 for looking at a map to find another route . a highway patrol officer saw him holding the phone and pulled him over . spriggs challenged his ticket , but lower courts agreed with prosecutors that the law forbids all use of handheld phones . " if our distractions cause us to drive erratically , we should be arrested for driving erratically , " he said . the ruling will have statewide impact if it withstands further appeals . the driver , steven spriggs of fresno , was stuck in freeway traffic on highway 41 in january . spriggs said he 's no champion of those who think they can get away with cruising down the road while staring at their phone or engaging in other such dangerous behavior . spriggs would like the law that ensnared him to be rewritten so officers can do their job unencumbered . " it 's personal for spriggs , whose son suffered a broken leg from a driver who was chatting on a cellphone . "
