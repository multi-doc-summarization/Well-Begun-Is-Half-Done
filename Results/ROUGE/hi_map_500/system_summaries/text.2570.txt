president trump blasted nfl players on friday morning for protesting the national anthem at preseason games , accusing them of being " unable to define " what they are protesting and suggesting the athletes should instead . " the nfl players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the us . numerous players , from different teams , wanted to show their â€œ outrage , " trump said in a tweet , per the new york daily news . " be happy , be cool ! a football game , that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy , is no place to protest . most of that money goes to the players anyway . find another way to protest , stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay ! " he added , " i do n't want to be able to do so . " he also said he 's not the first time to be suspended , but he says he has n't been seen as " cool . " " i have a lot of people , " he said .
