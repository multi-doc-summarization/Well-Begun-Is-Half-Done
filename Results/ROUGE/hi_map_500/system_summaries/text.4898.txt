" all of these criminal justice reforms , none of them are his , " christie told reporters outside camden . " there are people across the board -- folks who work inside the criminal justice system , folks who are affected by the board asking whether they have been convicted of a crime . " christie later said obama was attempting to take credit for reforms he was n't party to . " it ’ s not too late , " obama said in a trip to newark , where he visited a residential drug treatment center , mr. obama said that america would be stronger if it found ways to move criminals emerging from prison into paying jobs , but that too many employers dismiss applicants out of hand if they are honest and check too many communities . today , in newark , new jersey , president obama will continue to promote these goals by highlighting the reentry cycle of formerly-incarcerated individuals and announce new actions aimed at helping americans who ’ ve paid their debt to society rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities .
