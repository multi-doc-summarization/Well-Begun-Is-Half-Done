david neevel , an artist and inventor based in portland , was commissioned by the popular cookie brand to produce the world 's first oreo separator , the ap reports . " my oreo machine is based entirely on my dislike for creme and my preference for cookie , " neevel says . " he didn â€™ t let things like cold hands , cold cookies , or finding a decent sandwich place near his workshop stop him . a machine that halves oreos with a hatchet and then removes the creme is admittedly only so useful , but watching neevel explain the challenges he faced building it is weirdly captivating . " neevel is a physicist from portland who is the type of person who sees a problem to remove it , the new york daily news reports . the osm physicist is lowered to split the cookie halves , which are transferred to a hatchet table where the creme creme is removed to a " portlandia " sketch , which notes that it 's not clear whether the case will be in the case . " this is the most thing to be a <unk> , " he says .
