donald trump came under fire friday morning for his handling of a question at a town hall about when the u.s. can " get rid " of muslims , for failing to take issue with that premise and an assertion that president obama is muslim . trump , who has shaken off several high-profile controversies that would have ended other presidential campaigns , faced an immediate backlash from advocacy groups , and members of his own party distanced themselves from the gop front-runner . " we 're going to be looking at a lot of different things , " trump replied . " that 's my question : when can we get rid of them ? " the real estate mogul did not correct the questioner about his claims about obama before moving on to another audience member . white house press secretary josh earnest condemned the remarks friday , but added " is anybody really surprised that this happened at a donald trump rally ? " " anyway , we have training camps growing where they want to kill us , " the man , wearing a " trump " t-shirt , continued . " you know he 's not even an american . "
