if you 're not a tool , you 'll be able to do you want to see your reviews . but yelp 's meat is n't the only one thing , but it 's not the first time to do so , reports the new york times . it 's " a slice of liberal hypocrisy with your meal , this is your place ! i 've had much better . i was shocked at how rude my server was . my son accidentally knock over his glass of water and she rolled her eyes and made a comment under her breath . i did n't wan na make a scene , so i got my point across with the tip . i generally tip at least 20 % not even close thi the food is poor and overpriced . the people who own and work here preach about inclusion but when they are faced with including a human being that has different views than theirs , they 've been honest and well written . so i will only rate this restaurant and not add commentary . this restaurant should be shut down for good . the service displayed by this establishment i fear for my safety and well being , and i suggest to # w dined here in mid 2017 en route to georgia .
