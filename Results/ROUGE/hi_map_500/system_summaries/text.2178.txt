john mccain announced friday in a statement that he can not " in good conscience " vote for the gop 's latest plan to overhaul obamacare , likely ending republicans ' latest effort to repeal and replace obamacare before september 30 , as sen. rand paul of kentucky has said she is leaning " no " on the proposal . but there are still questions as to where alaska sen. lisa murkowski is at the moment . it 's also unclear if senators on the fence would support a procedural motion on the bill even if they decide they are against graham-cassidy . the poll from the left-leaning public policy polling finds that less than a quarter of respondents approve the graham-cassidy obamacare repeal bill . " i believe we could do better working together , republicans and democrats , and have not yet really tried . nor could i support it without knowing how much it will cost , how it will ( affect ) insurance premiums , and how many people will be helped or hurt by it . without a full cbo score , which wo n't have reliable answers to any of those questions , " the arizona republican said .
