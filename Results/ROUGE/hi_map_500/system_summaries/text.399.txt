kennedy 's vote is in play on voting district maps in wisconsin , the ap reports . the justices heard oral argument in gill v. whitford , a challenge to the redistricting plan passed by wisconsin 's republican-controlled legislature in 2011 . a federal court struck down the plan last year , agreeing with the plaintiffs of purposely drawing district lines to favor one party and put another at a disadvantage . after spirited supreme court arguments on tuesday , there was reason to think justice kennedy may be ready to join the court 's more liberal members in a groundbreaking decision that could reshape american democracy by letting courts determine when lawmakers have gone too far . justice kennedy asked skeptical questions of lawyers defending a wisconsin legislative map that courts should intervene when lawmakers draw election maps that greatly favor their party . both sides see him as the one who will likely cast the deciding vote and they pitched their arguments to him . in the middle of it all â€” voting districts are so warped by politics that they cross a constitutional line . the case arose after republicans won majorities in both houses of the wisconsin legislature .
