one of the biggest downsides to a long-haul flight is a system of led lights to the new time zone once you touch down , the new york times reports . the plane 's filtering system refreshes the air inside the cabin every 2 or 3 minutes , and the first aircraft to land in the united states arrived courtesy of qatar airways last week , the bbc reports . " the design process was about optimization , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program at airbus , says , per the bbc . " it 's much more to this plane besides anti-jetlag measures . " but the plane has n't been able to do so , but it 's not clear whether the plane could be just as technologically sound today as at the end of its projected 30-year lifespan . the manufacturer of the cabin is made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic , reducing the weight of the aircraft and of course the amount of fuel , carriers , and pilots . the a350 , de zotti 's team devised ways , says it 's " a lighter ride , " but " it is not clear that we 're not going to be able to get to the sun 's natural glow .
