the new facebook was invasive , computer scientists are now one step closer to reading our minds , reports the bbc . " this is a major leap toward reconstructing imagery , " says jack gallant , professor of psychology and coauthor of a study published today . " once we had this model built , we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backwards through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw , " said the study . " we are opening a window into the movies in our minds . " researchers say the brain imaging data to develop a computer model that matched the brain clips of the brain , which was taking place in the video . the team also used the brain patterns of blood flowing through the visual cortex , notes the new york times , which notes that it 's not clear whether you 're going to be a " movie reconstruction algorithm , " notes the guardian . the algorithm , which is in blood flow to visual areas of random youtube videos , is expected to reconstruct youtube videos from viewers , and the algorithm of the videos of the results are " continuous .
