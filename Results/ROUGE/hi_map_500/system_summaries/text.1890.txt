george takei took to his facebook page thursday night to explain what he meant by calling supreme court justice clarence thomas a " clown in blackface , " reports politico . " i feel justice thomas has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings . he made a similar remark about the japanese american internment , of which i won ’ t even respond to this because it ’ s literally nonsense . i honestly don ’ t be condescending . the people who took offense to your comments knew exactly what blackface is , and the entire ugly racist history behind it . on the contrary , you sound like the ignorant one for seriously trying to downplay that ugly history as just some cute theater factoid . 3 . no , no one cared if you right the right to tell someone that they have abandoned their entire race ? it 's bad enough when conservatives of color get this from people of their own race , but now it 's apparently a racial elimination free-for-all . and what kind of screwed up person believes that someone abandons the line on certain beliefs , they will be considered traitors to their race . in traditional theater lingo , and in my view and intent , that is not racist . it is instead part of a racist history in this country. .
