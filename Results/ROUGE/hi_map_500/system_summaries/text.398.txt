john mccain is calling sarah palin an " outstanding candidate " for the republican presidential nomination in 2012 , and says it 's very early to start picking winners and losers . " if i had to predict , " mccain told anchor harry smith , " and i 'm very hesitant to do so , i think we will be up late , or even after election night , waiting to see what happens in california and the state of washington . i think the election will probably depend on that , as far as senate majority . " he 's been active in the campaign , raising money , throwing her support behind a host of tea party-backed conservative republicans and giving speeches around the country . the arizona republican said " i do n't think sarah would want me to , before she 's even able to make a decision " about running . " yeah , we 've got to get our vote out . " palin 's been amused by the supreme court 's decision in citizens united , which allowed unfettered spending of money from anonymous donors ( including corporations , industry groups , unions and non-profits ) , mccain said the current glut of spending by house and senate .
