the danish radio host who killed a baby rabbit live on air , in a stunt on 24/7 , hit the nine-week-old bunny , allan , was killed by repeated blows to the head with a bicycle pump and asger juhl , one of the radio station 's hosts , later skinned it with his children and planned to eat it as rabbit stew with his family and fellow host kristoffer eriksen . " if you have men who will exclude any of god 's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity , you will have men , and there never will be . by killing an animal in the name of saving animals , it is you who are the hypocrites ; but i suspect the irony is lost on such as you , " asger says . " i hit it hard over the neck twice so that the cervical vertebrae fractured . " he 's been widely criticised for the story , but he says he 's not going to deal with a publicity stunt . " we do n't know what i do , " he said , per the new york daily news , which notes that juhl has told newsbeat that the baby rabbit has been made in the debate .
