the bodies of 40 confederate soldiers discovered over the past two months will receive a proper memorial . " it 's been very meaningful to us to find these spots , identify these soldiers and bring closure to families , " says ted delaney , the cemetery 's assistant director , who is optimistic about the project . " this has been an incredible process of discovery , " he said , adding that " the undertaker 's notes are so detailed and complete . " he adds that the remains of union soldiers were once buried and removed from the plot of land in 1866 . " our goal is to put a marker at each grave space to identify the soldier and note when he died and his military unit , " delaney told foxnews.com , per the new york times . delaney , who has been found in the same area last year , says he 's not the only visited historic site in the city , the guardian reports . the cemetery , however , has been charged with hundreds of varieties of native and heirloom plants , including the largest public collection of antique roses in the state of virginia .
