the leaders of the republican and democratic national committees on wednesday weighed in on the prospect of an independent presidential run by michael bloomberg . dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz suggested that the former new york city mayor 's priorities are already " well cared-for " in the democratic platform , while rnc leader reince priebus welcomed the idea , saying bloomberg would siphon off votes from the democratic candidate . the billionaire recently told the financial times he found " the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters , " and that he was " looking at all the options . " with two nominating contests gone and outsider candidates like bernie sanders and donald trump , the likelihood of a bloomberg bid could be growing . asked about the prospect by cnn 's wolf blitzer , wasserman schultz sought to ease the wealthy media mogul 's concerns , saying that the us public deserved “ a lot better . " his comments follow a new york times report​ last month that said the billionaire had told advisers to draft a plan for a run as an independent candidate that could see him spending as much as $ 1bn of his​ estimated​ $ 39bn fortune .
