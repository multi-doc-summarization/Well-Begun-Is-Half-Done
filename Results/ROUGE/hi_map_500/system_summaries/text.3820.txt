researchers have confirmed that three nile crocodiles were captured near miami , and they say it 's possible more of the man-eating reptiles are still out there , although no one can say for sure . the ancient icon eats everything from zebras to small hippos to humans in sub-saharan , 2011 , and other licensed florida attractions , reports the bbc . " the odds that the few of us who study florida reptiles have found all of the nile crocs out there is probably unlikely , " says the university of florida herpetologist kenneth krysko . " but we really do n't know how they got into the wild . " krysko and his co-authors are believed to be responsible for up to 200 feet long and weigh as much as a small car have been found in the sunshine state . " we know that they can survive , " he said , per the times . " they did n't swim from africa , " said krysko , who works at uf 's florida museum of natural history on the uf . the study notes that the study of the monster crocodile , which has been found since 2000 , is in the everglades .
