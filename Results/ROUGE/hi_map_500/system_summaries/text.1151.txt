president obama reviewed the draft of a speech he was scheduled to give a quote from pope francis 's recent letter to the catholic church . " some of you may have seen just last week , the pope himself spoke about this at eloquent length . ‘ how could it be , ’ he wrote , ‘ that it ’ s not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure , but it is news when the stock market loses two points , " obama said in the dec. 4 speech . " it 's true that the pope is the head of the vatican state , that ’ s hardly his primary role . in benedict 's case , obama is the authority brought in to lend credibility to obama ’ s policies . compare this to obama 's relationship with pope benedict xvi . at the conclusion of his visit to the vatican in 2009 , obama reportedly said that that he looked forward to “ a very strong relationship between our two countries. ” the pope has increased , but he says he 's not a " news item .
