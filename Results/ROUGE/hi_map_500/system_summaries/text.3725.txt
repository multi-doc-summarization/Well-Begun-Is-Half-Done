president trump ignited eleventh-hour confusion friday over republican efforts to push immigration legislation through the house , saying he would n't sign a " moderate " package . the white house on friday evening walked back donald trump â€™ s criticism of a house gop bill shielding dreamers from deportation , the product of weeks of negotiations between centrist republicans , conservatives and gop leaders , reports the ap . the campaign-season tumult erupted as gop leaders put finishing touches on a pair of republican bills : a hard-right proposal and a middle-ground plan negotiated by the party 's conservative and moderate wings , with white house input . only the compromise bill would open a door to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the u.s. illegally as children , and reduce the separation of children from their parents when families are detained crossing the border . " the president fully supports both the goodlatte bill and the house leadership bill , " shah said , referring to a conservative daca plan that 's expected to fail next week . but shah argued that trump was instead knocking a proposal backed by moderates and democrats that would codify the obama-era deferred action for childhood arrivals program without any significant immigration crackdown .
