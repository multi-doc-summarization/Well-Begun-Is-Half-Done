the environmental protection agency will move ahead of oil industry officials who call them costly and unneeded , according to a senior administration official . the proposed standards would add less than a penny a gallon to the cost of gasoline while delivering an environmental benefit akin to taking 33 million cars off the road , the white house council reports . the meeting , which has been stuck in regulatory limbo since 2011 , would reduce the amount of sulfur in compliance costs while providing little benefit , noting the cost would be at least double the administration ’ s estimate and could add up to 9 cents a gallon in some places . the obama administration 's decision to go ahead with the regulations deals a political blow to the oil and gas industry , which had mobilized dozens of lawmakers in recent days to lobby us gasoline by two-thirds and impose fleet-wide pollution limits on new vehicles by 2017 . it also comes as the administration alarmed the rules will create public health benefits , and calls them necessary for harmonization with california ’ s emissions rules . it 's not clear whether the administration has already been made yet .
