suspected islamic extremists sprayed gunfire at worshippers and torched four churches sunday in a village just miles from the town where more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped , witnesses say . at least 30 bodies have been recovered but more are turning up in the bushes , where people tried to escape from kwada village , said a member of a vigilante group that has had some successes in repelling attacks . " they killed dozens of people and burned houses after attacking worshippers , " survivor mallam yahi told the associated press by telephone from chibok town , to which he escaped . police spokesman gideon jubrin said he could not confirm the attack because bad communications have kept officials from reaching the nearest security post at chibok , though they gunned down villagers and burned down homes . the vigilante ministry said they had also arrested women from the intelligence cell . the military 's claims could not be independently verified . boko haram militants abducted more than 2,000 girls from their school in borno state on 14 april . most are still missing . the group says it will not free the girls until authorities release .
