virginia 's outgoing governor has pulled a prank on his successor . the washington post reports that ralph northam 's wife , first lady , spent their first night in the mansion with his head resting on the 72nd , and it was n't one of those fancy hotel good-night chocolates . " there are pictures of the governor all over the mansion that he left for me , " northam tells the post . " also , at 3 o'clock this morning , an alarm clock went off , which i have yet to find . i texted him and thanked him , and he said there was more to come . such pranks are common in virginia , the only state where the governorship changes hands every four years . " the post notes that his wife , who was a real bear taken from the office of mcdonnell 's natural resources secretary doug domenech , was also treated to several photos of mcauliffe around the residence and an early morning wake up call . " let me show you the picture , " says a post for the governor 's jefferson hotel . " i do n't know how to do . "
