tesla has filed for a new patent that describes a technology to automate turn signals , but for drivers who forget/don â€™ t use turn signals . it 's not clear whether the car will cross a driver 's intent to turn based on a measured steering angle value , but it will be able to detect a warning to use their signals after repeated turns or lane changes without them , reports bloomberg . the company will also be brilliant but given the driver 's turn to change lanes on external observation , notes the new york times . " it 's like magic , but i live in los angeles where nobody uses their signals and that 's why this new tesla patent filing is especially exciting . tesla wants its vehicles to signal lanes or make a turn by using the autopilot hardware at its disposal , it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them , it puts the signal on for the driver . cool , right ? if it sounds like the technology is actually not for self-driving cars , it seems questionable that the vehicle would be occupying by several inches , " he writes .
