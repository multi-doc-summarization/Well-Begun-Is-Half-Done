" i believe that we can bring a different tone to the democratic party that republicans should soundly reject .

" the remarks have stirred concerns among national republican leaders , and trump 's recent condemnation of most immigrants as criminals and rapists . he then doubled down on those comments in the wake of this month 's killing of a woman in san francisco , allegedly by an illegal immigrant felon .
