walter scott was killed by a police officer after a traffic stop last week in jail for 15 days because he had n't made his child support payments . the officer , michael slager , is charged with murder . some 15 years ago , the authorities escalate collection efforts , withholding up to 65 percent of a paycheck , seizing bank deposits and tax refunds , a policy employed by many states today . though the threat of jail is considered an effective incentive for people who are able but unwilling to pay , many critics assert punitive policies are trapping poor men in a cycle of debt , unemployment and imprisonment . the problem begins with child support orders that , at the outset , can exceed parents â€™ ability to pay . " he got to the point where he felt like it defeated the purpose. , " scott says . " i got mad at everybody in the whole world because i just lost us . " scott 's brother was working as a forklift operator when he died , but he went to jail . and then he lost his $ 35,000-a-year job at a film company .
