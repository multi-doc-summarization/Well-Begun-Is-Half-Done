a fossil hunter in sussex has been confirmed as the first example of fossilised brain tissue from a dinosaur dinosaur brain case , reports the bbc . " he picked it up and noticed that it was slightly unusual in its shape and its texture , " says alex liu of the university of cambridge , who died in 2014 . " there 's a series of bumps to this specimen that are quite characteristic of it fitting into the brain case of a dinosaur . " the results are reported in a special publication of the geological society of london , published in tribute to professor martin brasier of cambridge hunter jamie hiscocks near bexhill in sussex , and the fossil , which is most likely from a species similar to iguanodon , a large herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the early cretaceous period , about 133 million years ago . finding fossilised soft tissue , especially brain tissue , is very rare , which makes understanding the evolutionary history of such tissue difficult . " this kind of fossil gets made when sediment fills up a dinosaur 's skull cavity and hardens . later , if the skull breaks off and disappears , what 's left behind is a solid object that reveals the shape or so of this fossil , " he writes .
