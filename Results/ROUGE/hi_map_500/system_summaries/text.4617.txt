london 's transport authority said friday it wo n't renew uber 's license to operate in the british capital , arguing that it demonstrates a lack of corporate responsibility with implications in public safety and security . transport for london says the car-hailing app was not " fit and proper to hold a private hire operator license . " it cited its approach to handling serious criminal offenses and its use of software to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app , preventing " officials from undertaking regulator or law enforcement duties . " he says he disagreed with the decision but it was based on past behaviour . uber ’ s cars will not disappear immediately as its current licence expires on 30 september and it plans to challenge the ruling by london ’ s chief executive , dara khosrowshahi , wrote to staff on friday confirming the decision , saying any operator of taxi services in the city " needs to play by the rules . " london mayor sadiq khan said he supported the decision . the firm can continue to operate by uber losing its licence authority in the courts .
