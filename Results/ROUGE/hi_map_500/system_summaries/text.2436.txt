donald trump in the us airlines center on monday in dallas , the first concentrated campaign to dislodge the front runner in the race for the gop nomination . the ads will launch on thursday , a powerful and deep-pocketed free-market advocacy group , announced tuesday that its super pac will spend $ 1 million on a television ad blitz in iowa attacking the current gop front-runner . the group has been sparring with trump for a few weeks now on twitter and elsewhere , but the ad buy is the first time that it or any other conservative group has decided to spend big on the airwaves in a bid to bring the donald back to earth . on tuesday , that trump has made in recent years in which he takes positions on health care , taxes , and other issues that the group says align him with democratic front runner hillary clinton . one ad ends with a picture of mr. trump and his political world will watch with bated breath to see if trump , who has n't run paid tv ads yet , will respond to a challenge on the polls . but it 's no surprise that the first of the two tv spots is largely a repeat of attacks we â€™ ve seen before .
