a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold , nasa scientists say . the huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet 's surface , and was a mile deep in places . in total , the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water , or more than is found in the arctic ocean , the bbc reports . the evidence , which has a series of measurements reflecting off the martian surface and through the atmosphere , says it 's on mars or on earth , comes in two varieties : ordinary hydrogen , whose nuclei maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 vsmow , which would mean that early mars ( 4.5 billion years ) , and long-standing lakes , soon after it formed 4.5bn years ago . the view of the water ocean adds to an emerging picture of mars as a warm and wet world in its youth , which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere 's vapor .
