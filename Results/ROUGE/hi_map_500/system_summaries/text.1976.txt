former republican national committee chairman ken mehlman is gay is garnering a fair amount of attention in the political world , reports the new york daily news . " it 's something that runs counter to the stereotype , most of the conservatives i know are largely to completely indifferent to a person , " he said . " he is , after all , the most powerful republican ever to identify himself as gay . but my sense is that it ’ ll be a lot less of a big deal to conservatives than it might be to liberals like ( just to choose one name at random ) frank rich , for whom the political is also the personal . while it ’ s doing this now , it seems , because he wants to drum up publicity for the guy who helped run the most anti-gay presidential campaign in order to go out and vote republican , due to abject fear of gays . many influential republicans have worked with him and respect him . he makes it harder for them to think of homosexuality as a behavior . they now know that they know somebody who is gay .
