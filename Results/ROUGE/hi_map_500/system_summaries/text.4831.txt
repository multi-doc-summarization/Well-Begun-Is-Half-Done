a massachusetts marine biologist who examined a necropsy great white shark carcass found ashore near the rhode island state line was n't able to determine how the shark died , state officials say . a fisherman discovered the carcass saturday morning on a rocky shoreline in westport , less than a half-mile from public beaches in over 75 years . he survived , but the incident led many to question why so many sharks are lurking off the cape . biologist and shark expert simon thorrold said the sharks are likely responding to an increased number of mammals - but not of the human variety . " i think we 're probably seeing more white sharks in the area at the moment , " thorrold said . " and the white sharks have probably been drawn into the summer . in july , a spokeswoman for the massachusetts division of marine fisheries . little compton officials closed goosewing and south shore beaches after the shark was found . both beaches were spotted , prompting officials to raise the red flag , banning swimming at some of the areas most popular beaches . from south beach in chatham , to the northern tip of nauset beach in orleans , shark sightings are keeping bathers out of the water . one swimmer said , " someone told me they ca n't come close to the edge , but i do n't believe that anymore , so i 'm just staying out .
