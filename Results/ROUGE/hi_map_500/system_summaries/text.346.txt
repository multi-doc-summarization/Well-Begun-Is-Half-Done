a defense attorney says iran has set bail of $ 500,000 each for two american men arrested more than two years ago and convicted on spy-related charges . lawyer masoud shafiei says the court would free shane bauer and josh fattal after payment of the bail . shafiei was released in september 2010 on medical and humanitarian grounds after posting $ 500,000 bail . in the interview tuesday , ahmadinejad suggested he was open to a resolution of the standoff over the country ’ s uranium-enrichment program , although apparent deals have fallen apart in the past . $ 500,000 the hikers could eliminate a key flash point in relations between iran and the united states , although many more remain . it comes just weeks before ahmadinejad is due to visit new york for the annual u.n. general assembly meeting , and it coincides with other conciliatory actions by iran , including a letter to european union officials offering new talks on iran ’ s nuclear program . the bail amount is the same set last year for the release of a third american , sarah shourd , who was arrested with bauer and fattal along the iran-iraq border .
