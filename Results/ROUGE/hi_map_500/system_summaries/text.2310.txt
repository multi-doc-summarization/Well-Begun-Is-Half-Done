the network of the university of california , santa cruz has found a far-off gas cloud measuring a very large nebula of spread out gas , showing for the first time captured a glimpse of the network , reports the new york times . " this is a very exceptional object : it â€™ s huge , at least twice as large as any nebula detected before , and it extends well beyond the galactic , " says the lead researcher . " it was a lot of people . " the researchers say that the first direct images of gas spreading approximately 2 million light-years across intergalactic space , notes the bbc . the quasar is a zoomed-in , high-resolution image of a quasar can , like a flashlight , illuminate part of the surrounding cosmic web , 10 million light-years , from a simulation that includes gas as well as dark matter . like spiders , galaxies mostly appear to lie within the intersections of the long-sought webs . in observations spied through one of the most powerful telescopes in the world , the 33-foot ( 10-meter ) i telescope in hawaii , astronomers led by sebastiano cantalupo stretches between large , spacious simulation , and joel primack .
