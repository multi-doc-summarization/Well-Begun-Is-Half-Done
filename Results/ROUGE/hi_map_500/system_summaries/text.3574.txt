a boy born without ears has had a pair created from his own ribs at london 's great ormond street hospital , reports the bbc . " i 've always wanted big ears , and now i 'm finally going to have them , " he said . " he 's a very sociable boy and has longed for this operation for years . " sorkin said he and his wife , louise , were " on cloud nine " after the procedure . " they are a little bit more receptive so that should work well , " sorkin says . " we could not have wished for a better result . i do n't want children bullying him because he 's different . i 'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones . " kieran has since moved to a school with a deafness unit in every year group , and he 's born deaf with small lobes where his ears should have been . he 's also born deaf and also had a rare condition which meant to take a photograph of his newly crafted ear , or a " side selfie . "
