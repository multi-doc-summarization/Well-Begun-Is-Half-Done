water originating from solar winds has been found in solar winds and implanted in the lunar soil , the new york times reports . the solar winds of the moon 's atmosphere is not a new discovery , reports the bbc . " this water would be as much trouble as it ’ s worth , " he says . " with the cost of $ 25,000 for taking one pint of water to the moon , it is essential that we develop processes of producing water from the materials on the moon . " the study notes that the moon is " paramount , " and that " this is paramount to human settlement of the lunar rocks and soil . now we have ready sources of water that can not only be consumed by plants and humans , but also electrolysed into its constituent elements – hydrogen and oxygen – to make rocket fuel . " she adds , " i think it 's a pretty long shot , extracting the water might be of most value as rocket fuel — liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . until the recent discovery , this was going to be a very energy-intensive endeavor to separate these elements from the moon rocks .
