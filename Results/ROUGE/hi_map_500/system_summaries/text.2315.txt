dunkin ' donuts plans to roll out a croissant-doughnut hybrid in the u.s. next week , but the company says please do n't call it a " cronut . " john costello , dunkin 's president of global marketing and innovation , said in a phone interview that bakers around the country have been mixing doughnuts and croissants for at least 20 years , the ap reports . " are we copying a specific bakery in new york ? the answer is no , " costello said . the croissant donut is worth thinking of as a form of competition , if only on purely darwinian terms , in which all coexistence is competition of something new , pervasive , and quite possibly perverse : the hybridized and fetishized schnecken . oblivious of the peril , we wake and find ourselves in an age of mutated pastry , cross-bread , trying to be two things at once . doughnuts cross with croissants , montreal bagels are made puffier for new york tastes , and new york bagels . it comes more than a year after the dominique ansel bakery in soho , and also because , truth be told , rubin ’ s combination of croissant sweetness and pretzel salt is by now a familiar staple of the lower-manhattan breakfast , while the crowd for ansel ’ s pretzel croissant-doughnut is still a phenomenon , creating lines that sometimes start crawling around the block at spring and thompson streets at five in the morning .
