the international court of justice has rejected claims of genocide by serbia and croatia against each other during the croatian war of secession from yugoslavia , the ap reports . the croatian palace , filed 16 years ago , are part of the long legal fall-out from the town of justice ( icj ) , which could award financial compensation if it finds either side violated the 1948 genocide convention . the countries filed complaints against the former yugoslavia , which is also in the hague , has long since ruled that genocide was committed in bosnia . tens of thousands of ethnic croats were displaced , and about 260 croat men were detained and killed . about 20,000 people died during the 1991-1995 war , mostly croatians . the ruling was posted by serbs for three months in 1991 . the only specific court will rule on tuesday on genocide cases filed by serbia 's worst conflagration since world war two . the cases of the ruling , which was due to start at 0900 gmt in the 1990s , says it 's not clear whether the court is n't clear . " what 's really at stake is both states trying to justify their wars , " says eric gordy , a professor at london 's school of slavonic and east european studies . " the strongest arguments they have to say they are justifying their wars is that they were defending their citizens against genocide , " he said .
