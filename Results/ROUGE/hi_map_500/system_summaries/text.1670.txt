china on wednesday called on the u.s. to bar a taiwanese delegation from attending donald trump 's inauguration on friday , underscoring concerns that the incoming president could seek to redefine relations between beijing , taipei and washington . foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the request had been passed to trump 's transition team and to the current administration of barack obama . " we urge the u.s. side once again not to allow the taiwan administration to send the so-called delegation to attend the inauguration and to avoid any forms of official exchange with taiwan , " hua said in a newspaper interview that washington 's " one china policy " under which it recognized beijing in 1979 was open to negotiation , and earlier questioned why trump broke with decades of precedent last month by taking a congratulatory call from taiwan president tsai ing-wen . trump angered beijing and upset decades of diplomatic precedent by talking by phone with taiwanese president tsai . trump was opposed for taiwan to send a delegation to u.s. presidential inaugurations . a spokesman for taiwan president trump â€™ s office said no meetings were scheduled with the new trump administration while the delegation was there for the event .
