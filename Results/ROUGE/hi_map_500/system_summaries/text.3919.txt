coast guard officials are considering setting the gulf of mexico oil slick on fire as it moved tuesday to within 20 miles of a broken pipe attached to a well 5,000 feet below sea level , the ap reports . oil is still leaking at a rate of about 42,000 gallons a day from the well , located some 50 miles off the coast of louisiana beneath a drill rig that exploded and sank last week . bp , the well 's owner , is racing to shut off the well using eight remote controlled submarines , but has had no luck as of yet . officials say oil slicks indicated that the oil would not reach land in the next three days , and it was unclear exactly where along the gulf coast it might arrive first . “ if some of the weather conditions continue , the delta area is at risk , ” says charlie henry , scientific support coordinator for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . admiral landry said a final decision had not been made yet about whether to burn the oil . “ we fully understand there are benefits and trade-offs , ” she said .
