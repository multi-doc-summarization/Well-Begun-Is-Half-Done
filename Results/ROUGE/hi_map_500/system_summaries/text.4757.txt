" it feels like hell on earth . the minerals are mined at bayan obo , 120km farther north , then brought to baotou for processing . the concentration of sulphur line the shore , its endless cooling towers and chimneys reaching up into grey , washed-out sky . between it and me , stretching into the distance , lies an artificial lake filled with a black crust , so thick you can walk on it .
