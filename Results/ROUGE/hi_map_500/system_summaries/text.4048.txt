carl paladino was on msnbc 's concession speech , but it 's not clear whether he 's going to reveal himself as a performance artist . " i promised to bring a baseball bat to albany , well here it is , " he said . " the only thing higher than the rent is charlie sheen ! " he added , " paladino is in danger of losing his gig on " two and a half men . " paladino essentially lived up to that measure , as he stammered through a bitter and angry speech , railing against his political opponents and critics in the media . staring into his telepromter , battling with a crowd who kept interrupting him with their own concessions speeches and criticisms . they do n't even trust sheen with a shoe , saying that if they do , because we made a shit-ton . in this psa of sorts , mcmillan and his " son " timmy mcmillan to grab the baseball bat , and by the looks of this funny or die video , he is definitely in on the joke . ( the bottom line is , according to mcmillan sr. . )
