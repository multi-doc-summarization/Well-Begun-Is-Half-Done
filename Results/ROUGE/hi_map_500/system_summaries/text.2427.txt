the new orleans times-picayune has been moving away from paper for years , the new york daily news reports . the owner of america 's oldest papers says it 's " most of my journalism career at the times-picayune and have many friends there , so the news that its owners are slashing the staff , dismissing top editors , and cutting back publication days is very difficult to process . my heart goes out to my valiant former colleagues , and to the city itself , which will suffer from having reduced news coverage and seeing one of its signature and award-winning journalism efforts . clearly i was lucky to be there during that era , and that era is now definitively over . ( ironically or not , the tp just published a great series on the louisiana prison system . but where will the next one come from ? ) what now ? the newspaper industry is in a profound , seemingly neverending crisis ; this is a tactical trend for new orleans , with its rebuilding challenges , its rich culture , the odd mix of civic virtue and corruption , and its long-term existential risks from hurricanes and rising seas , deserves a first-class newsgathering operation .
