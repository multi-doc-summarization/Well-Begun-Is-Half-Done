" today 's indictment moves us closer to resolution of this gruesome case , " mcginty stated in a written release . " our investigation continues , as does our preparation for trial . " prosecutors say castro abducted michelle knight , 52 , of kidnapping the women and raping them repeatedly in his home , where he sometimes kept them chained and rarely allowed them to leave the house . the women , as well as berry 's 6-year-old daughter , who authorities say was fathered by castro , were freed in a two-year period starting in 2002 .
