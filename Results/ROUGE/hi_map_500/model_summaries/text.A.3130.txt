the new york daily news will this week become half of what it once was , at least in terms of staff . parent company tronc , which acquired the paper in september for $ 1 , on monday announced in a memo that it would be cutting its editorial staff by roughly 50 % to focus more on digital news and " address the significant financial challenges we have faced for years . " the ap reports revenues sank 22 % between 2014 and 2016 , and prior cuts had taken place . those ousted include editor-in-chief jim rich , who npr reports communicated his displeasure on twitter , where he changed his bio to " just a guy sitting at home watching journalism being choked into extinction . " the new york times , which reports the newsroom staff had numbered 75 to 100 , notes he tweeted the following at 1:40am monday , " if you hate democracy and think local governments should operate unchecked and in the dark , then today is a good day for you . " robert york , editor of the tronc-owned morning call in allentown , pa. , will fill the slot . the memo says editorial efforts will be refocused around breaking news , " especially in areas of crime , civil justice and public responsibility . ... we will , of course , continue to cover local news , sports and other events , but our approach will evolve as we adapt to our current environment . " those given the boot will receive 90 days of severance . marcus baram worked for the paper in the late '90s and reports on how low morale was prior to these cuts in a piece for fast company .
