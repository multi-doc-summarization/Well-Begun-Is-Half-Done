scientists have discovered a new virus apparently transmitted through blood transfusions . little else is known about human hepegivirus-1 , or hhpgv-1 , besides that it looks a bit like hepatitis c and the harmless and perhaps beneficial human pegivirus . " it is the first transfusion-associated virus that 's been described in a long time , " a researcher tells nbc news . he adds " we do n't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis , " but scientists say it 's unlikely . in fact , " it may be good for you . " they first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers , part of a study of 46 , who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980 . the virus only appeared after transfusions , but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease . two more cases were found among 106 who 'd received plasma , per mbio ; both cleared the virus , though one was infected for five years . even if the virus is harmful , researchers say there 's no need to panic . " this is not sars . this is not mers . this is not hiv , " says an expert . whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products , they now use genetically engineered products . plus , blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago . " does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety ? i don â€™ t think we 're at that level , " a pathologist at the blood systems research institute tells science . scientists have yet to isolate the virus but say the next step is to develop an antibody test to find hhpgv-1 in a larger population . afterward , experts can determine whether those with hhpgv-1 antibodies appear less healthy than those without the virus and look for links to disease . ( a study suggests the seeds of alzheimer 's may pass through blood . )
