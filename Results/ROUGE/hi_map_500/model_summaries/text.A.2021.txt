for any non-baseball fans out there , this is a huge no-no . texas rangers catcher yorvit torrealba was playing in the venezuelan league on friday when he struck out badly and began yelling at the home plate umpire—probably over a strike call earlier in the at-bat . the two of them jaw for a good 15 seconds before torrealba smacks the ump flat in the face mask , the sporting news reports . the blow even sends the umpire stumbling backward . the rangers say they 're looking into it . " ( we 're ) aware , but we have n't got much info yet , " rangers manager jon daniels says . possible disciplinary measures will depend " on circumstances. ” maybe torrealba is mad because he 's in the second year of a $ 6.25-million contract , and has seen his playing time wane with the rise of red-hot mike napoli . one baseball writer can barely disguise his contempt on yahoo : " whatever explanation and apology torrealba comes up will simply not be good enough .
