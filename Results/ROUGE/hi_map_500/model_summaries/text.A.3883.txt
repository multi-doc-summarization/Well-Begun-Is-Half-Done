merriam-webster sent out a tweet this week subtly asking for help from the public in fixing the situation surrounding the lead contender for its " word of the year " honors . " 'fascism ' is still our # 1 lookup , " it informed twitter . " there 's still time to look something else up . " without spelling out why that word has attracted so much attention in 2016 , mashable reports that several words " that will forever echo somewhere in the pits of our brains " have entered the vernacular this year at a brisk pace , including , per the online dictionary , " bigot , resurgence , diatribe , socialism , misogyny , [ and ] xenophobe . " however , " fascism " has vaulted to the fourth-most-searched word in the site 's history , per the washington post . " guys , 2016 is so bad it made the dictionary sad , " one twitter user noted . but mw apparently does n't want to leave 2016 with fond thoughts of " a political philosophy , movement , or regime â€¦ that exalts nation and often race above the individual and stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader , severe economic and social regimentation , and forcible suppression of opposition . " and the internet came to the rescue , with people flooding the lookup tool with searches for " puppies , " " squirrels " ( that was a dog 's request ) , and , finally , a word that could soon overtake " fascism " if people keep up the campaign . " 'flumadiddle ' is now in our top lookups . not as many as 'fascism . ' but more than that phrase from gilmore girls , " the mw account tweeted , referencing the " in omnia paratus " ( " ready for all things " ) term used on the show . ( merriam-webster made a controversial decision about hot dogs earlier this year . )
