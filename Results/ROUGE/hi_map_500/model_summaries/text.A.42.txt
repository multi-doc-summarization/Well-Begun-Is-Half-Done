a us serviceman has become the world 's first man to ever receive a full penis and scrotum transplant . per usa today , the veteran was injured by an ied years ago while on combat tour in afghanistan . surgeons from the johns hopkins university school of medicine announced the historic news on monday after performing the unprecedented surgery in baltimore last month . the patient is expected to recover both urinary and sexual function , according to the surgeons . surgeons said they rebuilt the man 's entire pelvic region over the course of 14 hours . per the ap , the scrotum transplant did not include the donor 's testicles , meaning reproduction wo n't be possible . " we just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions " with that extra step , said hopkins ' dr. damon cooney . three other successful penis transplants have been reported , two in south africa and one in 2016 at massachusetts general hospital . those transplants involved only the penis , not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex . hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant . the hopkins patient received an extra experimental step , an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient 's immune system better tolerate a transplant . surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several . in a statement from hopkins , the patient was quoted as saying : " when i first woke up , i felt finally more normal .
