he 's ok now , but a toddler in china went 10 days with part of a chopstick in his brain . it seems young hanhang tripped and fell with the chopstick in his hand , and it went straight up his nose , according to a report by central european news spotted by fox . his parents saw it happen , removed the chopstick—or so they thought—and took him to the hospital to be safe . unfortunately , doctors sent him home without realizing that about 2 inches of the chopstick had broken off and was still inside . “ when we got home after our first visit to the hospital , my husband broke all the chopsticks in half and threw them away as we were worried something like this could happen again , ” says his mother , yu liao . when the boy grew increasingly lethargic and sick , his parents brought him back , and only then did an x-ray reveal the reason . hanhang showed immediate improvement once it was removed . the mommy files blog at the san francisco chronicle rounds up two similar stories and concludes , " note to parents : chopsticks are to only be handled by children sitting at the dinner table . " ( the x-ray calls to mind another strange case , this one involving a nail gun . )
