marissa mayer 's recently announced ban on telecommuting at yahoo has caused quite a brouhaha ; now , the company is responding . " this isn ’ t a broad industry view on working from home , " the firm says in a statement issued yesterday , per the new york times . " this is about what is right for yahoo right now . " that was essentially the extent of its comments , but the times also spoke with yahoo workers who say a number of employees are slacking . ( earlier reports noted that mayer had grown frustrated with employees who trickled in and left right at 5pm . ) requiring them to show up at the office could restore some enthusiasm—and allow the company to monitor the situation . indeed , some telecommuters have even started their own companies while working from home on yahoo 's dime , the workers say . some employees might quit , but the company would prefer to lose the dead wood . meanwhile , at business insider , henry blodget—who works part-time for yahoo—comes to mayer 's defense . " for the past decade , yahoo has been in desperate need of a ceo who is willing to set a high bar and make the tough , unpopular decisions necessary to whip the company back into shape , " he writes . " mayer has demonstrated that she is more than capable of doing that . "
