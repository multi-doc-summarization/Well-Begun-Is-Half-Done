if you 've ever thrown out good food , pope francis says you 're a thief . " throwing away food is like stealing from the table of those who are poor and hungry , " he said during an audience at the vatican this week , in which he blamed a " culture of waste . " he 's got a point , since one study says as much as half the planet 's food ends up in the trash . the united nations ' food agency has a more reserved figure , noting that one-third of human food is wasted , according to reuters . since becoming pope , francis has made defending the poor a priority , calling for global financial reform , but yesterday he said people are " insensitive even to the waste and disposal of food , " according to the telegraph . " [ it 's ] even more despicable when all over the world , unfortunately , many individuals and families are suffering from hunger and malnutrition ... in this way people are discarded as if they were garbage .
