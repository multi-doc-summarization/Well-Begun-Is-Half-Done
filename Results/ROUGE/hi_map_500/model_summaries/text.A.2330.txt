the tsunami that killed hundreds , possibly thousands of people after an earthquake in indonesia on friday was much bigger and more devastating than would normally be expected after that kind of quake , scientists say . " we expected it might cause a tsunami , just not one that big , " geophysicist jason patton tells the new york times . tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on sulawesi island are usually caused by " megathrust " earthquakes that move land vertically , not " strike-slip " quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one friday , which moved the earth horizontally , patton says . the sulawesi event was , however , localized , unlike the 2004 indian ocean tsunami . it may have been the case , patton says , that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami , or that the narrow bay that palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave 's power . indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early , though expert adam switzer at the earth observatory of singapore tells the ap that this is unfair . " what it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic , " he says . " they do n't take into account multiple events , multiple quakes within a short period of time . they do n't take into account submarine landslides . " the official death toll now stands at 844 , though authorities , who have been preparing mass graves , have been unable to access some hard-hit areas , the guardian reports .
