a california man imprisoned for 16 years for sexual assault was exonerated monday after dna tests showed another man committed the crimes , usa today reports . luis vargas , 46 , broke down when an la superior court judge granted a petition to release him from his sentence of 55 years to life for three sex crimes . the move came after dna evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the teardrop rapist , so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye , the ap notes . that man , who was never caught , is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the la area . vargas had matched assailant descriptions , and he caught investigators ' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time , reports the los angeles times . " you can sentence me to all the years you want , but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there , " vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999 . in 2012 , vargas reached out to the california innocence project and asked to use dna techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims , per the times . the dna matched that of the victim and the teardrop rapist . the three victims had positively ided vargas as the perpetrator , but an innocence project attorney tells the ap it was a " shaky witness " case , an assertion the la district attorney 's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist , the times notes . vargas still has to clear up some immigration issues before he 's fully released , but he hopes to be home by christmas .
