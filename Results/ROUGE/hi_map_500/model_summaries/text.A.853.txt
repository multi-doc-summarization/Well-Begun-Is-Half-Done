" go buy ivanka 's stuff . " that was kellyanne conway 's message to viewers during an interview with fox & friends on thursday after nordstrom pulled ivanka trump 's clothing line from its stores . the problem ? she might have violated federal ethics rules with the plug . government workers are n't supposed to endorse products , and conway not only did so , she was n't shy about it : " i 'm going to give a free commercial here , " she said . " go buy it today , everybody . you can find it online. ‚Äù per the hill , this is the rule from the office of government ethics she appears to have run afoul of : " an employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain , for the endorsement of any product , service , or enterprise , or for the private gain of friends , relatives . " it 's not clear whether the oge will investigate , but someone who violates this rule can be suspended or even fired , though the person is likely to receive only a warning for a first offense , reports politico . " this is jaw-dropping to me , " a former acting director of the office tells the washington post . it " would seem to be a clear violation . " president trump , of course , has also addressed nordstrom 's move , tweeting , " ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @ nordstrom . " white house spokesman sean spicer says trump 's tweet " was less about his family 's business and an attack on his daughter , " per cnnmoney . nordstrom has said the decision was about declining sales , not politics .
