cory booker now looks poised to become senator cory booker in this fall 's special election in new jersey , a feat that would make the high-profile newark mayor only the fourth black person elected to the senate . so why are there so many raspberries coming from the left after last night 's primary win ? because he " is loathed by some progressives in a way that 's only now being noticed , " writes david weigel at slate . " a booker victory will mean the replacement of a reliable , plodding progressive with a less reliable neoliberal . " or as alex pareene at salon put it , booker is " an avatar of the wealthy elite , a camera hog , and a political cipher who has never once proposed anything to address the structural causes of the problems he claims to care so deeply about . " he 'll follow that same superficial path in the senate , predicts pareene . ed kilgore at the washington monthly sums up the booker phenomena thusly : " for admirers , he ’ s the next barack obama , a charismatic african-american pol with possible transpartisan appeal . to detractors , he ’ s an unholy combination of harold ford jr. , and joe lieberman , beholden to wall street and silicon valley . " the bigger issue for critics , he adds , is whether booker has white house ambitions . for more on the liberal unease with booker , see the week .
