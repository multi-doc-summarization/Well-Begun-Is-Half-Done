the usps is n't the only woebegone postal service . things are bad enough in finland that the state-owned posti is getting into ... lawn care . under the new program , which begins next month , postal workers will mow residents ' lawns each tuesday , when mail volumes are typically lower , broadcaster yle reports . interested finns can go online to order the service , which will run from may 17 through august . a weekly 30-minute cut will cost about $ 74 a month , and homeowners must provide the mower . in a press release , posti head anu punola says she anticipates that people will be " happy to outsource lawn mowing , " adding that the idea came from the mail carriers themselves . last year , posti reported losses of about $ 85 million , per the atlantic , with delivery volumes down to 1960s levels . nonetheless , posti says , mail service is provided to 2.8 million households and " new home services will see it transform increasingly into a service company . " indeed , the atlantic notes posti launched a 12-month pilot program in february where , in partnership with a health-services company , postal workers will visit the homes of people with disabilities and do light chores , like warming up meals and helping with eating . " posti 's network of professionals reaches both densely and sparsely populated areas every weekday , " points out a press release . as for the mowing , some are grumbling . the bbc reports a group that represents property maintenance companies is concerned postal workers do n't have the " expertise " to operate lawnmowers , adding , " it is hard to believe that just anyone can start to cut lawns .
