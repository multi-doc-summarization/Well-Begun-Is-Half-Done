it could be a $ 6.5 million hat—but it might also not be . wbez reports that the crown jewel of the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum 's collection , lincoln 's stovepipe hat , one of just three thought to still exist , may not have belonged to the 16th president after all . two reports obtained by the station found insufficient evidence to tie it to lincoln . one was a 2013 report penned by top curators with the smithsonian national museum of american history and chicago history museum who sought to establish its historical provenance : the springfield , ill. , museum had maintained that lincoln gave the hat to an illinois farmer in 1858 , though a century later a descendant said the hat was given in 1861 during a visit to dc . the report found " the current documentation is insufficient " to support either story and suggested the museum " soften its claims " or even try to return the hat . it was acquired in 2007 as part of a mammoth $ 25 million purchase of lincoln items by the abraham lincoln presidential library foundation , which runs separately from the museum . the foundation in 2014 asked the fbi to see if dna analysis could establish a tie to lincoln . it relied on dna from lincoln 's hair and blood-spattered items from his assassination but found a " limited quantity of remaining dna data " in the hat ; most of what it recovered " was consistent with being contemporary dna from an individual who had recently handled the item . " the story gets thornier : alan lowe—the museum 's executive director since july 2016 , per the chicago sun-times—only recently learned about the reports , a timeline that he called " unacceptable " in a letter to the foundation . the foundation itself is mired in financial troubles tied to its 2007 buy , which currently has it $ 9.7 million in debt .
