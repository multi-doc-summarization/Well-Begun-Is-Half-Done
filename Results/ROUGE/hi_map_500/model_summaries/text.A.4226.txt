" he also put some of the blame on " [ chuck ] schumer and the democrats " for " obstructing " nominees he 's made for these positions , though a washington post/partnership for public service tracker points out he 's made far fewer nominations than the four presidents before him by this time in their tenure . trump did touch upon one slot that 's filled at state : rex tillerson 's post . per politico , the president was asked if the secretary of state would remain with his administration " for the duration , " to which trump replied : " we 'll see . i do n't know who 's going to be [ here for the ] duration .
