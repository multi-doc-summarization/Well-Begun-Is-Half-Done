papillion sophie has lived a pampered life , but that does n't have to end now that her famous owner—hollywood legend lauren bacall—has died . according to estate papers filed last week , bacall left $ 10,000 to her son sam robards for sophie 's care and upkeep , page six reports . this bequeath is n't a surprise , considering bacall called herself a " dog yearner " in a 2008 interview , us reports . " i did n't have a dog growing up in the city with a working mother . as an only child , i yearned for someone to talk to , " she said . she gave sophie quite a glitzy life attending book signings and film festivals . bacall did n't ignore her human family : the new york daily news reports her $ 26.6 million estate was mostly split among her three children ; her grandkids reportedly got $ 250,000 each . and two of her employees also received $ 20,000 and $ 15,000 , respectively . considering other famous four-legged heirs , sophie 's 10 grand is n't shocking : leona helmsley left $ 12 million to her maltese and alexander mcqueen left $ 82,000 to his three dogs . but the oddest may be dusty springfield , who gave orders that her cat be serenaded with her own music and " marry " another cat .
