mitt romney 's aides are using the crisis in the middle east as a backdrop to flesh out their candidate 's foreign policy , and it 's a hawkish one , the new york times reports . aides said that if mitt romney had been president over the past four years… the us would have been actively involved in helping to form libya 's post-revolution government . he 'd have set down the kind of " red line " against iran that israel is looking for , using military action if iran crossed a certain point in nuclear development . they said romney would n't have allowed iran to enrich uranium , though the times points out that it was doing that during much of george w. bush 's second term . the us would be " facilitating " the flow of arms to syrian rebels , though not directly arming them . one obama aide quips that it " sounds a lot like they are endorsing our position . " all the positions are much more detailed than anything romney himself has said on the campaign trail . the aides also attacked president obama over the libya crisis in especially harsh terms . " there is a pretty compelling store that if you had a president romney , you 'd be in a different situation , " one adviser told the washington post . " for the first time since jimmy carter , we 've had an american ambassador assassinated . … the respect for america has gone down , there 's not a sense of american resolve . "
