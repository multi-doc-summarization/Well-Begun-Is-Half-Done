when patton oswalt tweeted on sunday , " what 'd you guys do yesterday ? , " it was less a call to conversation and more to reveal what he did on saturday : marry meredith salenger , per page six . his tweet showed him holding hands with his 8-year-old daughter , alice , who in turn was holding hands with salenger on the happy occasion . while page six did n't have much in the way of wedding details , which us says took place at the jim henson company lot in los angeles , oswalt , 48 , and salenger , 47 , offered some insight online , including an oswalt tweet showing aimee mann and michael penn performing for their first dance . oswalt also showed off a photo of his smiling daughter , with the caption " world champion flower girl . " salenger gushed about becoming stepmom to alice ( " this little girl is mine ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! , " she tweeted ) , posted a pic of herself and alice , and shared a poignant photo of oswalt hugging his daughter , with the simple caption : " my family . " people documents all that 's happened since oswalt 's first wife , michelle mcnamara , died in her sleep in april 2016 , including his grieving process , his first public appearance with salenger in june , and their journey toward marriage , with alice at the top of their priority list .
