first jon huntsman 's daughters made a splash on twitter , thanks to their tactical deployment of wit and snark . now they 're taking to youtube , featuring a parody of the infamous " smoking man " video put out earlier in the week by herman cain 's campaign manager , mark block , reports raw story . all the women sport big mustaches , like block , and intone their lines with much seriousness , also like block . but where block said , " tomorrow is one day closer to the white house , " liddy huntsman deadpans , " tomorrow is friday , one day closer to the weekend . " and instead of block 's line , " if i did n't believe that , i would n't be here , " family ties apparently nix such freedom : “ even if we didn ’ t believe that , we ’ d still have to be here , ” says abby huntsman . and for the big finish ? no , they do n't puff a cigarette like block did . but they do blow soap bubbles ( very moodily , of course ) . for some choice snarking from the huntsman daughters , check this out .
