there was fire , but no real firefight . that 's the latest revision in the white house 's version of events during the raid on osama bin laden 's compound . the fire came from some 20 navy seals who shot dead bin laden and three other men and a woman , only one of whom was armed , officials say now . bin laden 's courier , ahmed al-kuwaiti , fired on the seals as they launched the raid . after he and his wife were shot dead , the americans were n't fired on again , reports ap . the others were killed because us forces believed they all posed a " serious threat , " said a federal source . initially , white house officials said the special forces came under heavy , prolonged small-arms fire as they moved into bin laden 's hideout . instead of chaos amidst a hail of gunfire , the team moved methodically from room to room in what the new york times characterizes as a " one-sided " 40-minute operation , confronting bin laden aides and gathering some 22 children and women , some of whom were placed in plastic handcuffs . the us forces ended up in bin laden 's bedroom , shooting his wife in the leg and the apparently pajama-clad al-qaeda leader in the head and chest , reports msnbc . bin laden was shot as he appeared to be reaching for a nearby weapon , said a spokesman . cia chief leon panetta had reported that the men were " engaged in a firefight throughout the operation . " white house officials said all details of the raid were not initially clear . " they were in a threatening and hostile environment the entire time , " one official told the times .
