( original story here ; sample of criticism here . ) " do you even know anything about me ? " risen asked . " maybe you were still in school when i broke the nsa story , i do n't know . it was back when you were in kindergarten , i think . " ( risen shared a pulitzer in 2006 for a story on secret wiretapping . cook was age 33 . ) " the thing that amazes me is that the blogosphere thinks they can deconstruct other people 's stories , " risen continued . and while a tamer version of this line appeared on yahoo news , cook tweeted that risen accused bloggers of sitting around and " jerking off in their pajamas , " reports new york magazine . minutes after hanging up , risen called back . " i was taken aback by some of the criticism , and did n't sleep well last night , and was upset about it . i apologize . "
