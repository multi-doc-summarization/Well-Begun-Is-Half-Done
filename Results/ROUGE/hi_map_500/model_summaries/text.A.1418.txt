lane-splitting—where motorcycles pass other cars in traffic by cruising in between—might soon be legal in at least one state : california . the state 's assembly unanimously passed a bill thursday giving the california highway patrol authority to create guidelines for the practice , reports the los angeles times . the bill , which would make california the first state to give the official ok to lane-splitting , has kept things vague , simply defining what a " lane " is and directing the chp to fill in the blanks . the bill 's original wording would 've allowed the practice only if a motorcycle was going less than 50mph and not more than 15mph faster than traffic , but the specifics were later removed before passage . while critics say lane-splitting is dangerous for all involved , advocates cite several reasons for why zipping between cars is desirable : it saves fuel for bikers , cuts down on traffic congestion , and even keeps motorcycles from overheating , as the bikes are n't designed to sit in traffic , one biker tells kcra . " it definitely makes a motorized two-wheeler the second fastest way around the city in rush hour by a long shot , " andrew collins writes for jalopnik . and it could even spare motorcyclists from injury : nj.com says motorcycle groups and a university of california at berkeley study point out that stop-and-go traffic can be dangerous for bikers because drivers in big cars may not spot them .
