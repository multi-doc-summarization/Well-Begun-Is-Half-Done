the former los angeles county prosecutor who failed to convict oj simpson of murder in 1995 says she would probably fail to convict now , for the same reason : jurors who did n't care whether he was guilty or not . in an interview for an nbc dateline special , marcia clark says some of the nine black jurors " came in for the purpose of payback " amid a similar climate of " racial mistrust " of the police as exists today . " they did n't care whether he was guilty or innocent , " clark says . " they were going to use this case for payback . " there was plenty of evidence pointing to simpson 's guilt , but it " did n't wind up mattering because there was a fundamental large issue standing in the way of seeing the evidence , " she says . " you had this enormous mistrust of everything lapd , everything officer related . " " there was no way to reach that jury . there was no way to make them believe . there really was n't , " clark says , per the hollywood reporter , which notes that interest in the case has surged during the airing of the fx series the people v. oj simpson : american crime story . clark says the infamous decision to have simpson try on a glove found near the murder scene was n't hers . she says co-counsel christopher darden came up with the idea and apologized after it backfired . she says she told him it was ok. " if that lost the case for us , we were never going to win anyway , " she says . ( a knife allegedly found nearly two decades ago on simpson 's former estate is now being tested by the lapd . )
