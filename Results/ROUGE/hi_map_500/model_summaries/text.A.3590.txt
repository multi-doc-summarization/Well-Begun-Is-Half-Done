" i have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety of all patriots in my community , " hallinan says in the video , as quoted by nbc miami . " so effective immediately , i 'm declaring florida gun supply as a muslim-free zone . i will not arm and train those who wish to do harm to my fellow patriots . " but the chief executive of cair calls it blatant " islamophobia " that must be challenged . " unfortunately , he caved in to a lot of the anti-muslim pressure and anti-muslim base that he 's pandering to , " hassan shibly tells usa today . " when he refused to reconsider his position , when he refused to reconsider to be educated , refused to engage this community , refused to respect american law , we had no choice but to bring forward this lawsuit . " meanwhile , chris martin , a us military veteran who converted to islam , has traveled to inverness , florida , from california so he can try to enroll in a training course at the shop to challenge the ban , reports wfts-tv . federal agents are reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation .
