the us teen diagnosed with " affluenza " will now be represented by a lawyer described as a " rock star . " cbs dfw reports mexican attorney fernando benitez will be representing ethan couch as he attempts to avoid deportation back to the us . benitez is looking into whether couch 's human rights or due process were violated when he was detained in mexico last week , according to fox news . he says it could be months before couch 's return to the us is even a possibility . " he has n't committed a crime in mexico , " benitez tells wfaa . " why would mexico go along with this idea of locating someone and summarily kicking them out of the country so the marshals can grab him across the border ? i do n't think that 's okay . " benitez says couch 's past—in which his family 's wealth allowed him to avoid jail after killing four people while driving drunk—is irrelevant , and that this is " an international law case only , " fox reports . the lawyer says the legal treatment couch gets in the us " may not be up to mexican constitutional standards . " according to cbs , benitez denies earlier reports couch was in possession of a gun while in mexico . couch is currently being held in an immigration facility in mexico city , wfaa reports . his mother was deported last thursday . benitez is well known for a previous case in which he got a former us marine out of jail after the marine " accidentally " entered mexico with three guns .
