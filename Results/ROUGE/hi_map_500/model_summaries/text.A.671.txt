the father of a soldier killed in afghanistan in june says he was " floored " when president trump promised to write him a check for $ 25,000â€”but it never arrived . chris baldridge tells the washington post that when trump called a few weeks after his son , army sgt . dillon baldridge was killed , he told the president that he and his wife were struggling to deal with the fact that their son and two others were killed by a rogue afghan police officer instead of in battle . baldridge , a construction worker in north carolina , says trump offered him $ 25,000 after he complained that his son 's $ 100,000 death benefit would go to his ex-wife instead of his parents , even though he can " barely rub two nickels " together . " he said , ' i 'm going to write you a check out of my personal account for $ 25,000 , ' and i was just floored , " baldridge says . " he said , 'no other president has ever done something like this . ' " but no check arrived in the following months , and baldridge says trump also failed to follow through on a promise to have his staff set up an online fundraiser . cnn reports that when asked about baldridge 's case wednesday , white house spokeswoman lindsay walters said the check " has been sent . " " it 's disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture , made privately by the president , and using it to advance the media 's biased agenda , " she said . ( trump is feuding with another gold star family . )
