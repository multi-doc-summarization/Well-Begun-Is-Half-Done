lebron james is taking plenty of flak over tonight 's big announcement in the who-does-this-guy-think-he-is vein . ( witness drew magary 's rant at deadspin , where he refers to james as a " self-aggrandizing sack of shit " and does n't think much better of espn . ) but phil rosenthal at the chicago tribune thinks james has n't milked this enough . there 's clearly a public appetite for this , he argues , but the james camp mobilized too late to truly capitalize on it . have n't they ever watched the bachelor ? this is like showing only the final rose ceremony . " if james and company had been on top of this , his web site would have tracked his whole courtship process . he could have kept an ad-supported video diary , including behind-the-scenes video of meetings with franchises . " let people scoff . " if news consumers are interested demonstrably in something , far be it for media hoping to remain viable to tell them to go look for it somewhere else . "
