a million people have now fled syria to avoid the war raging there—and half of them are children , the un high commissioner for refugees reported today . " syria is spiraling towards full-scale disaster , " commissioner antónio guterres said . " we are doing everything we can to help , but the international humanitarian response capacity is dangerously stretched . " the defections have accelerated dramatically this year , with more than 400,000 fleeing since january . the un had n't expected to pass the 1 million mark for three more months , the bbc reports . the influx has put a real strain on neighboring countries ; lebanon , for instance , has seen its population swell as much as 10 % , while turkey has spent $ 600 million on refugee camps . jordan and iraq have also been sharing the load . jordan 's king yesterday urged other countries to help carry " the tremendous burden , " and guterres echoed that call . " these countries should not only be recognized for their unstinting commitment to keeping their borders open for syrian refugees , " he said , " they should be massively supported . "
