it was snowing on feb. 24 , 1944 , when jewish children in the french town of gemeaux were rounded up at their school . two sisters , denise and micheline lévy , aged 10 and 9 , clutched dolls—one pink , one blue—as they were led away to auschwitz . a gendarme grabbed the dolls and flung them to the ground , le parisien reports , via the telegraph . a shopkeeper picked them up and gave them to the grandmother of frédérique gilles , a 38-year-old schoolteacher , who has now donated them to the shoah memorial , the holocaust museum in paris . the dolls were among 200 items put on display sunday , out of 19,000 objects collected by volunteers . in many cases like the lévy sisters , they are all that remain of the deported . for two generations , gilles ' family minded the dolls . " but nobody ever played with them , " she told the paper . " we knew their history . " they tried to find out what happened to the lévy sisters , but turned up no clues . gilles said it seemed wrong to keep the dolls . " we wanted to give them to a museum , or a place of memorial . " it was difficult to let them go , she added , " but it was the best thing we could do for the memory of those little girls . " over the past two years , volunteers for the shoah memorial criss-crossed france collecting a trove of objects belonging to those deported , including photos , a jersey emblazoned with a star of david , a violin case , and fading slips of paper noting the jews in hiding stacked in a little red box , reports telerama . " some preferred that we borrow the objects … so they could pass them on to their children , " shoah curator lior lalieu-smadja told telerama . " we understand their choice but , unfortunately , we know that quite often this evidence will be lost . "
