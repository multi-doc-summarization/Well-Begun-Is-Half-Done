although it was " very sad , " the breakup of ariana grande and pete davidson at least seemed to be civil . apparently that tenuous detente has ended , at least per the buzz around the 25-year-old singer 's recent tweets . people reports on an snl promo that dropped this week featuring her former fiance , as well as actor jonah hill and singer maggie rogers , in which davidson introduces himself to rogers , then immediately asks , " you wan na get married ? " after rogers rejects his " proposal , " davidson deadpans for the camera : " 0 for 3 " ( ostensibly referencing his failed relationships ) . shortly thereafter came the already-deleted and somewhat confusing grande tweets , which many are taking to be jabs at davidson . " for somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh , " was her first one , followed by , " thank u , next . " usa today notes davidson had previously poked fun of his whirlwind-romance-gone-south during a comedy show last month , in which he quipped : " well , as you could tell , i do n't want to be here . there 's a lot going on . " grande did n't seem to get ( publicly ) peeved at that joke . ( grande has been having a tough time after ex mac miller died . )
