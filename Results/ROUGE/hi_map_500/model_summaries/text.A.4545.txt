reactions are flying in to the supreme court 's decision to strike down much of arizona 's immigration law , but one of the most extreme came from the court itself . speaking in dissent of the ruling , antonin scalia questioned whether arizona and other states would have even joined the union if they 'd known today 's ruling was coming , politico reports . he said the ruling particularly " boggles the mind " in light of obama 's recent executive order on immigration . he said delegates at the constitutional convention would have " rushed to the exits " at the thought of obama 's move . but while scalia may have been incensed , seemingly every other quarter was declaring victory , or at least partial victory . for example : jan brewer called it a " victory for the rule of law , " and for the 10th amendment , because " the heart of sb 1070 can now be implemented , " meaning the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other crimes . joe arpaio agreed . " i think this is a good section that 's been upheld , " he said , though he lamented the loss of " the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being there illegally . " president obama said he was also " pleased " with the decision , which " makes unmistakably clear ( that ) congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform , " but said he was still " concerned " about the remaining provision , according to cnn . mitt romney 's statement , meanwhile , was decidedly vague . " today 's decision underscores the need for a president who will lead on this critical issue , " he said . " president obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration . " he said every state has a duty and right to secure its borders , but offered no explicit opinion on the ruling itself .
