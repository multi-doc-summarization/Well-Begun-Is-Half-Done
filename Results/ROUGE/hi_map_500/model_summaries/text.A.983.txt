using a smartphone to look a map while driving is allowed under the california law that bans motorists from talking or texting on a handheld phone , an appeals court has decided . the court sided with steven spriggs , who was fined $ 165 after a highway patrol officer spotted him looking at a map on his iphone while stuck in freeway traffic , reports the san francisco chronicle . the court noted that the law was enacted in 2006 , a year before the first iphone came out . the judges decided that the law only applied to conversations , and interpreting it otherwise would make it illegal to look at the time on a phone " or even to move it for use as a paperweight . " spriggs says the law should be written more clearly , adding that his son suffered a broken leg from a driver who was chatting on his phone and he definitely does n't approve of distracted driving . " we 're distracted all the time , " he tells the ap . " if our distractions cause us to drive erratically , we should be arrested for driving erratically . "
