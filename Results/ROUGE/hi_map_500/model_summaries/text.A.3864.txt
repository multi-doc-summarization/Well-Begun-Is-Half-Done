yes , president trump took the opportunity of the national prayer breakfast to drag arnold schwarzenegger and his weak celebrity apprentice ratings . but he also brought up something arguably just as important : the johnson amendment , which he vowed to " totally destroy . " here 's what you need to know : the washington post has a great explanation of the johnson amendment , which basically bans churches and charities from participating in political campaigns unless they give up tax-exempt status . getting rid of the johnson amendment is part of trump 's emerging " agenda of religious nationalism , " in which the president is linking being american with being christian , the atlantic reports . msnbc weighs in on why promising to " totally destroy " the johnson amendment is important . one such reason is that it would allow political parties and candidates to " funnel campaign donations through tax-exempt churches " with no oversight . while the johnson amendment is wildly unpopular with the religious right , that 's not necessarily the case elsewhere , the independent reports . a survey last year found 79 % of people did n't think pastors should endorse candidates . and some religious leaders believe churches would be hurt by entering the partisan world of politics . in addition to the johnson amendment and celebrity apprentice , trump also discussed foreign relations , telling those in attendance , " just do n't worry about " the " tough phone calls i 'm having , " apparently in reference to threatening to invade mexico and picking a fight with australia , marketwatch reports . outside the national prayer breakfast , around 150 members of local churches were protesting trump 's muslim travel ban . one christian author at the protest tells yahoo news it 's important for the church to " stand up and be on the right side of history .
