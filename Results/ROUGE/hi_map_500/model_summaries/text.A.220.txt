between 1999 and 2013 , eminem released some of his most famous work , including 1999 's the slim shady lp , 2000 's the marshall mathers lp , and 2002 's the eminem show . now a new company has formed to nab the royalties income stream from his songs from that period , and fans may eventually be able to fatten their wallets by investing via a rather unusual opportunity . per billboard , royalty exchange has created a new business called royalty flow and inked a letter of intent to buy either a 15 % or 25 % portion of the performer 's income stream ( depending on how much money it raises via crowdfunding efforts ) and then allow fans and investors to share in income from those royalties via dividends if and when the company becomes listed on nasdaqâ€”a template that billboard says may prove to be " new business model for other superstar artists . " variety notes the deal comes via brothers jeff and mark bass of fbt productions , who invested in eminem 's catalog early and are now said to be estranged from him . although royalty exchange 's ceo says in a statement the plan offers " a powerful new financing option with a level of transparency seldom found in the music industry , " one industry expert tells rolling stone that selling an artist 's catalog piece by piece " starts to look like human slavery . " meanwhile , eminem 's statement , via a rep : " eminem is not involved in any deals for the sale of recording royalties and has no connection to this company . the decision to offer the royalty stream for sale or otherwise was made independently by a third party who retains royalties for an early portion of his catalog and eminem was not consulted . " billboard dives deeper into the financial and legal complexities of this setup .
