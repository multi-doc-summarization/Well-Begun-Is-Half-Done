after just short of 20 years , the murder of jonbenet ramsey is as much of a mystery as everâ€”especially in light of a new examination of dna evidence . a joint investigation by the boulder daily camera and 9news calls into question former district attorney mary lacy 's decision to exonerate the ramsey family . at the time , lacy concluded that dna evidence found on jonbenet 's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the ramsey family . but now three forensic experts who examined the dna test results and lab reports used by lacy say they do not support her conclusion . for one thing , a sample on her underwear identified as coming from " unknown male 1 " may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus " worthless as evidence , " says the news report . another revelation that further muddles the picture : dna samples on her long johns appear to come from jonbenet and at least two other people , not one , a fact that has never been revealed before . what 's more , the independent experts say all of the unknown dna may be the result of " inconsequential contact with other people , " reports the camera . with the exoneration , " i was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice , " lacy tells abc . ( the interview was done before these latest revelations . ) " i was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence , no psychopathy , and no motive , the case was a train going down the track and the ramseys were tied to that track . " comparison to the dna profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects . ( jonbenet 's older brother is suing a pathologist who accused him of the killing . )
