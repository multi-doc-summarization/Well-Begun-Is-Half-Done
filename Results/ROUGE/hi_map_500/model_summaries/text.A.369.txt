new calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise : the universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought . using the hubble space telescope , scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5 % to 9 % quicker than expected , the researchers say in a press release . for the record , they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec , the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years . it 's surprising , upi reports , because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by nasa and the european space agency . if the new rate is confirmed , it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of einstein 's theory of relativity , reports the guardian . " if you really believe our number—and we have shed blood , sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the leftover glow from the big bang , " says co-author alex filippenko of berkeley , per the christian science monitor . while 5 % to 9 % may not seem like a big deal , it constitutes a " major discrepancy " in this particular case , notes gizmodo . part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the " mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 % of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " says another of the project 's researchers . their findings will be published in astrophysical journal .
