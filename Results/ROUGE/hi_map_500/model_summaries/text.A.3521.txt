roland bosee jr. , 68 , and nino esposito , 78 , have been inseparable since they first met in 1970 . " you meet someone and it just clicks , " esposito told the pittsburgh post-gazette last month . so with the scotus decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage , the men looked forward to finally tying the knot . but one issue is holding them back : esposito is technically bosee 's father , because he adopted him in 2012 . " we thought never in our lifetime—or in 20 lifetimes— ... same-sex marriage [ would ] happen , " bosee said , adding to cnn that the adoption " gave us the most legitimate thing available to us " at the time . even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled , allegheny county judge lawrence o'toole —known for being progressive on lgbt issues—rejected that plea , noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs " would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally . " adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons , as well as to strengthen emotional ties . the men said it was both : esposito told the post-gazette " we felt we lacked a family of our own , " but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they were n't considered relatives . one person on the couple 's side : pennsylvania sen. bob casey , who tells the post-gazette , " i was n't aware that lgbt couples were turning to this method . i ca n't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved … to visit a loved one in the hospital . " casey has written a letter of support to ag loretta lynch , asking her office to " consider issuing guidance " in cases like this ; her office is reviewing it , a rep tells cnn . ( the gay marriage decision held up a heterosexual couple 's divorce . )
