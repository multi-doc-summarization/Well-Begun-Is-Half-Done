sarcasm does n't always translate well . when satirist andy borowitz wrote this column at the huffington post headlined " in latest compromise with gop , obama agrees he is a muslim , " the saudi media utterly missed the joke . a respected newspaper , al-hayat , and website , sabq.org , reported it as straight news , notes afp . " obama does n't mind coming out as a muslim if that will satisfy the republicans , " read the newspaper 's headline , while the website went with , " obama : ' i 'm ready to announce that i am a muslim . ' " if only they 'd read to the bottom of borowitz 's column , the " quote " attributed to julian assange after his arrest— " i knew i should n't have signed up for foursquare " —might have tipped them off that the whole thing was joke . or maybe not .
