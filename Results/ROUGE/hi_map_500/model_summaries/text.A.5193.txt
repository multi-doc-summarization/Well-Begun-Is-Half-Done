" we 're expected to forgive the bullies because the authorities are sure they did n't mean it , " emily gipson says in a youtube video posted jan. 22 . " sometimes i wonder how many kids it takes dying to make a difference . " the 16-year-old sophomore at tennessee 's lebanon high school made the video after a classmate 's apparent suicide , the ap reports . the video went viral—surpassing 800,000 views—and gipson has been hit with a two-day suspension . in the video , she says her school is an " emotional prison " and a place " where creativity is put down , where the people who make fun of others never get punished because 'there 's no proof , ' or 'there 's nothing we can do about it , ' or , my favorite , 'kids will be kids . ' " principal scott walters says his feelings and those of teachers were hurt by the video , but that 's not why gipson was suspended . gipson says the school administration accused her of " trying to incite violence , " but walters says she was suspended for filming in a classroom after school without the teacher 's permission or knowledge , the tennessean reports . gipson says she had permission from two coaches , and in a statement quoted by cnn , wilson county schools spokesperson jennifer johnson confirms that gipson asked a coach if she could use the classroom only to have the coach later be " mortified by the nature of her message . " johnson adds that it 's " patently false " to say gipson was punished for inciting violence and there 's " no evidence whatsoever " that the student who died was bullied , despite the claims of other students . gipson says she wanted " to be a voice for as many people as possible " and ends the video by imploring others " do not be the bully ... do not be the one that takes their own life .
