clarence thomas jolted a courtroom awake monday during supreme court proceedings when he did something he has n't done in more than 10 years : he asked a question , the ap reports . the usually reserved justice—whose long silence has been dubbed a " curiosity " and raised accusations of neglecting his duties , per cbs news—had court reporters sitting up straight and caused what courthouse news service calls an " audible shift " in the room when he suddenly started making inquiries . his questions came during a case in which the court weighs whether to walk back a federal ban on gun ownership for those convicted of domestic violence . " can you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right ? " was thomas ' initial question , posed to a justice department lawyer after she presented arguments for the ban . thomas did n't quit there , also throwing out a question about whether the feds could shutter a publisher if it recklessly displayed kids in " compromising circumstances , " per courthouse news . it was his first question from the bench since feb. 22 , 2006—a silence thomas has explained before by noting he 's good to go with just written legal briefs and that he does n't like to " badger " lawyers who only have a short time to present their arguments , cnn notes . " everyone leaned in disbelieving , " a slate reporter in the courtroom tells cnn , which adds this was one of the first oral arguments the court has heard since antonin scalia—who had defended thomas ' reticence—died . " that he 's now asking questions—for the first time in over a decade—is as powerful evidence of the impact of justice scalia 's absence as anything we 've seen from the justices thus far , " an american university law professor says .
