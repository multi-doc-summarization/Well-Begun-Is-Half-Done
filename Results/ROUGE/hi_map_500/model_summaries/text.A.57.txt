well , that did n't take long : less than two days after amc 's ceo gave an interview in which he suggested the theater chain might allow texting in its theaters , he 's put out a statement backtracking . " no texting at amc . wo n't happen . you spoke . we listened . quickly , that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor , " reads a tweet friday accompanying the statement . in the statement , ceo adam aron acknowledges the social media uproar that followed the texting news ( usa today has rounded up sample tweets from people who swore never to visit an amc theater again ) and says that the chain will not allow texting any time in the " foreseeable future . " one analyst tells cbs that aron 's actual idea might not have been as irksome as it sounded : " one of the things keeping millennials away from the movies is that they need to be on their phones all the time . what [ adam aron ] wants to do is segregate different groups so that people do n't want to be on their phones , i.e. , older demographic groups , and those who do could be in different [ auditoriums ] . " and aron tried to make that clear on twitter thursday , tweeting that amc might simply do a test run on " very few screens " and would make sure it was done " in a way we 'd be totally confident all our guests will fully enjoy movie going experience . " but that was n't enough , garnering responses like , " no ! not even one ! what a stupid idea . "
