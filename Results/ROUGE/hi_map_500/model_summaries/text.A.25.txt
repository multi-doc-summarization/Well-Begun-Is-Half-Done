" and the show 's hosts , designer hilary farr and real estate agent david visentin , and its resident general contractor ? " actors or television personalities â€¦ [ who do n't play ] more than a casual role in the actual renovation process . " per their contract with big coat , the couple deposited $ 140,000 that would be used to pay aaron fitz construction and its subcontractors . about $ 85,000 was distributed to aaron fitz during the overhaul , even though murphy and sullivan say they expressed concerns about mediocre reviews seen on angie 's list . the rest of the money got pumped into producing the show , the couple claims , reports today.com . they say the show is " even more of a scam than it generally seems , " as the av club frames it .
