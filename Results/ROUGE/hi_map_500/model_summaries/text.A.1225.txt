when covering the story four years ago , newser 's headline read , " $ 7.5m bitcoin fortune buried in landfill . " that fortune ended up in a welsh landfill after james howells threw out a hard drive over that summer while cleaning up his workspace . on it was the cryptographic " private key " he needed to access his 7,500 bitcoins—which are now worth far , far more . with bitcoin valued at roughly $ 17,000 as of wednesday , those 7,500 lost bitcoins are worth more than $ 127 million , reports cnbc . he tells the telegraph that he has n't " sat here crying about it , accidents happen . " but that has n't deterred him from hoping he 'll one day get to go searching at the newport landfill , something the newport city council currently wo n't allow . it would be a novel undertaking : " a landfill has never been excavated in the uk before " for non-criminal reasons , he says , " so we ’ re in uncharted territory with regards to regulations , local authorities and environmental agencies .
