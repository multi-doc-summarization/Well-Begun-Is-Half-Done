a young man who went for a pre-christmas haircut got a disorderly one , while his barber got slammed for disorderly conduct , the wisconsin state journal reports . per madison police spokesman joel despain , the 22-year-old patron headed over to ruby 's salon on friday and asked for an inch off the top and the sides shaved , and his stylist , 46-year-old khaled a. shabani , set to work . the police report notes the customer asked for a no . 2 buzzer for the sides and that scissors be used to trim the top . the customer soon realized things were " not going well , " however , when shabani started chastising him for not keeping his head still , which earned him an ear-twisting , per the report . the situation got worse when shabani allegedly " snipped " his ear with the scissors , drawing blood , and used a " zero " buzzer ( which provides the closest cut ) to swoop right down the middle of his head . the result ? the customer got a buzz that left him " looking a bit like larry from the three stooges , " despain says . which is when the customer says he got up to leave , with shabani allegedly yelling after him , " you want a zero , right ? " shabani was cited for mayhem and disorderly conduct while armed , which the journal notes is not a criminal charge but a county ordinance violation . " while it is not a crime to give someone a bad haircut , you will get arrested for intentionally snipping their ear with a scissors , " despain says . the customer had another stylist elsewhere shave his head all the way to rid himself of the stooges look . per a police report , shabani told cops the ear-snipping was an accident , but buzzfeed reports on yelp reviews that note other bad experiences at the salon , including one ex-patron that says his visit felt like it " [ bordered ] on assault .
