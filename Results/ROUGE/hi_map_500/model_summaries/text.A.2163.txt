boris becker 's claim of diplomatic immunity in an ongoing bankruptcy case just went from odd to bewildering . though the former tennis champ claims his april appointment as a central african republic attache to the european union means he 's immune from bankruptcy hearings in the uk , the car appears to be balking . becker 's claimed post of attache for sports , culture , and humanitarian affairs " does not exist " in car records , meaning he 's not an official diplomat , says foreign ministry chief of staff cherubin moroubama . what 's more , the diplomatic passport issued to becker in march , listing his post as " financial charge de mission , " is phony , with a serial number matching one of several stolen under a transitional government in 2014 , moroubama says , per the bbc and guardian . car foreign minister charles armel doubane calls the passport a " clumsy fake , " per abc australia . " to be recognized as a diplomat , it would require not just [ the ] president 's nomination but also my signature as foreign minister , " he adds , per the guardian . that leaves plenty of questions for car 's ambassador to the eu , daniel emery dede , who reportedly signed becker 's passport , and for the car embassy in belgium , which confirmed the issuance of it and featured a photo of becker on its website , per the bbc . becker , who met with car president faustin-archange touadera in brussels in april , is maintaining his diplomatic status amid the confusion , reports deutsche welle , which has a certificate a lawyer says confirms becker 's position as attache for finance , as well as for sports , culture , and humanitarian affairs .
