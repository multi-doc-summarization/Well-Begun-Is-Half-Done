critics aren ’ t exactly howling over the new remake of the wolfman starring benicio del toro , giving it mostly mediocre or failing marks . here ’ s what they ’ re saying : “ the movie is pungent with atmosphere , laying down a thick fog of creepy victorian murk , ” writes kyle smith of the new york post , but the story is toothless , centering on a mystery “ so simple that even marmaduke could have sniffed it out. ” “ the movie is scary only as regards all its wasted potential , ” laments john anderson of the wall street journal . there are good elements here , but they ’ re “ reduced to a gruesome fondue , accessorized by actorly ham and studio cheese. ” the filmmakers obviously loved the original wolfman , but “ nostalgia is n't always the best barometer , ” writes james berardinelli of reelviews . the makeup is “ inexcusably campy , ” and scenes from the original are “ recreated in a fashion that seems more monty python than unsettling. ” but ty burr of the boston globe had fun . “ the movie is by no means good , ” he writes , “ but it ’ s surprisingly enjoyable : a misty , moody saturday-matinee monster-chiller-horror special . ”
