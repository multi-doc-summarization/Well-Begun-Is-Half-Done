it looks like shakespeare 's skull really is missing from his grave . that 's what an archaeologist has concluded after researchers were allowed to use ground-penetrating radar to scan the bard 's final resting place , reuters reports . " we have shakespeare 's burial with an odd disturbance at the head end and we have a story that suggests that at some point in history someone 's come in and taken the skull of shakespeare , " says staffordshire university archaeologist kevin colls , who says the findings are " very very convincing " that the long-standing rumors of a missing skull are true . he tells fox news that analysis shows the " odd , strange " disturbance at the head end of the grave is a sign " of material being dug out and put back again . " per those rumors , grave-robbers took the skull from shakespeare 's grave at the church of the holy trinity in england 's stratford-upon-avon in 1794 . at the time , trophy hunters believed a person 's genius would be apparent in his skull . rumors also claimed that shakespeare 's skull might be hidden in a sealed crypt at another church nearby , but colls ' team investigated and found the skull there was that of a woman in her 70s . the team also discovered that shakespeare was buried in a simple shroud , not a coffin , and that he and his wife were buried in shallow graves , not a deeper family vault as had been believed , newsweek adds . researchers , who ignored a curse in shakespeare 's epitaph in order to do their non-intrusive analysis , present the findings in a documentary airing in britain saturday .
