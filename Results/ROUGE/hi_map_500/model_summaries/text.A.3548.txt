fascism 's shadow hung over spain monday as a former doctor was found guilty of stealing newborns for infertile couples—but still went unpunished , the bbc reports . a madrid court ruled that gynecologist eduardo vela , 85 , had taken newborn ines madrigal from her biological mother in 1969 and gave her to another woman who was wrongly certified as madrigal 's birth-mother . but judges said the 10-year statute of limitations for " unlawful detention " had expired , since madrigal became an adult in 1987 and only brought the complaint in 2012 , per the guardian . " i didn ’ t know about any of that in 1987 , " says madrigal . " but vela ’ s lawyer brought up the statute of limitations again and again during the trial—right from the start . " and madrigal is n't alone : thousands of similar cases have been reported , since general franco 's fascist regime allowed doctors to take newborns from " left-wing " mothers and give them to pro-franco families , per the ap . priests and nuns made lists of parents seeking children while doctors allegedly lied to mothers about what became of their kids . even post-franco , spaniards often kept quiet in a society that respected the roman catholic church and embraced a so-called " pact of forgetting " during the 1970s transition to democracy . but with the european parliament pressing spain to take action , this drama appears far from over—except for vela , who ducked a prison sentence that prosecutors wanted to last for 11 years .
