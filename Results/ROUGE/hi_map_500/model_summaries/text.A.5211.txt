a 21-year-old university of texas-austin student is suing the school to keep from being expelled one semester before graduating after being accused of raping a woman , fox news reports . his lawsuit claims a disciplinary hearing scheduled to decide his fate violates " his constitutional right to due process . " the college fix explains the unnamed student wo n't be able to call witnesses or cross-examine the alleged victim during the hearing . the school has already recommended he be expelled . the alleged sexual assault took place last march after the student met two women at a house party and went home with them . he had sex with one of the women that night before having sex with the alleged victim in the morning . the lawsuit states the student believed the alleged victim was consenting to sex , in part , because she " talked about being in a pornographic movie . " but she later texted her friend that she was still unconscious from heavy drinking the night before and did n't remember having sex with the student . the lawsuit points out the alleged victim never filed a police report ( she did talk to campus police , and her father later complained to the school ) and claims she later told her friend the sex must have been consensual because it sounded " passionate " even though she did n't remember it . the university of texas-austin released a report monday detailing how its officers deal with sexual-assault allegations , according to the texas tribune . “ trauma victims often omit , exaggerate , or make up information when trying to make sense of what happened to them or to fill gaps in memory , ” the report states . “ this does not mean the sexual assault did not occur . ”
