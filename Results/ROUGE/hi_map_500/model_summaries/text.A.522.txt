the best wedding present kathy and brandon gunn received at their michigan wedding was one they never opened—at least not for nine years . that was because the gift from great-aunt alison came with a special instruction : " on the plain white box was a card that read , 'do not open until your 1st disagreement , ' " kathy gunn wrote in a post on the love what matters facebook page , spotted by upi . “ now , there had obviously been plenty of disagreements , arguments , and slammed doors throughout our 9 years , " writes gunn . " there were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box . " doing that , she says , " would have symbolized our failure . " so the box sat on shelves in various closets through the years , gathering dust . " it somehow taught us about tolerance , understanding , compromise , and patience , " writes gunn in a post that so far has racked up 14,000 likes . finally , on aug. 30 , after the couple put their kids to bed and had some wine , they decided to crack open the box . inside , they found wineglasses , envelopes of money , and some advice . to kathy : pick up a pizza or " something you both like , " and get a bath ready . to brandon : go get flowers and a bottle of wine . " it was by far the greatest wedding gift of all , " says kathy . the huffington post rounds up photos of the couple here . ( a math quiz was enough to tank this couple 's marriage . )
