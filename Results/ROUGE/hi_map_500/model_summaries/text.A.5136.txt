usually municipal workers taking the initiative to replace a broken picnic table would be heralded as a minor civic victory . however , that 's less the case when the " broken picnic table " was actually a 6,000-year-old tomb under government protection . npr reports the tomb is believed to have been built by neolithic celtic settlers in what is now the town of san cristovo de cea in spain . after removing the granite slabs they thought had been parts of a bench , workers poured concrete into the burial chamber and topped it off with a picnic table . a spanish archaeologist tells the local he was " horrified " by the " monumental error " after an environmental group discovered what had happened in june . town officials say they were n't aware the tomb was even there , despite it being listed as a heritage site . " no one told me , " the mayor tells el huffington post . " the site was n't even marked . " but a regional government department is investigating the situation and tells the local " the town council was well aware of its existence . " according to npr , this kind of thing is n't unheard of . two years ago , workers in belize accidentally ruined a 2,300-year-old mayan pyramid because they needed rubble to fix a road . but more often these ancient sites are destroyed on purpose . last year , for example , developers dismantled a native american burial ground in california to make room for some million-dollar homes . ( this kid knows a thing or two about accidentally destroying precious things . )
