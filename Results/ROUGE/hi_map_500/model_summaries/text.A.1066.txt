psychopaths just do n't grasp punishment the way normal people do . so say researchers who used mri scans to analyze the brains of 12 violent psychopathic criminals , 20 violent criminals who are not psychopaths , and 18 healthy controls who are not criminals . it turns out that the psychopath cohort had a much harder time changing their behaviors and choices when playing an image matching game , as well as adapting when the rules of the game changed , reports time . abnormalities were seen in brain regions that process things like moral reasoning , guilt , and embarrassment . this may explain why previous research has shown that rehabilitation using negative reinforcement like punishment rarely works on psychopaths . " psychopathic offenders are different from regular criminals in many ways , " one researcher tells livescience . " regular criminals are hyper-responsive to threat , quick-tempered , and aggressive , while psychopaths have a very low response to threats , are cold , and their aggressive behavior is premeditated . " on the plus side , researchers hope that earlier behavioral interventions in young kids could potentially change actual brain structure and function , though not much is yet understood about how one 's genes and upbringing contribute to the making of cold-blooded , psychopathic killers . ( psychopaths also seem to have a terrible sense of smell . )
