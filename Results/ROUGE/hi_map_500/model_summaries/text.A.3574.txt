an operation in london has given 9-year-old kieran sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs , no less . born deaf with no ears , kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid , but he still wanted ears . " i want people to stop asking me questions , " he told the bbc . " i 'd like just to look like my friends . i 'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones . " so surgeons traced an outline of kieran 's mom 's ears , removed cartilage from the boy 's ribs , and sliced , contoured , and sewed the cartilage . then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears . they do n't perform any function , but kieran 's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost : " if you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age , you can change their whole trajectory in life , " he said . the ears should last , too , because they 're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics , the guardian reports . every year about 100 british newborns lack one or both ears ( it 's called microtia ) , and the hospital kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year . scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients , instead of ribs . kieran might have liked that , since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried " wow ! " and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation . ( click to read about a man who needed surgery to remove a tooth growing in his nose . )
