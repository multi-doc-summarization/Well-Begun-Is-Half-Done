the mormon church 's big revelations did n't stop with its sacred undergarments : in an online essay titled " plural marriage in kirtland and nauvoo , " the church for the first time declares that founder joseph smith was a polygamist , with a footnote stating that " careful estimates " put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40 . the essay explains that smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842 ; in the last instance , the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant smith . the leader , then married to first wife emma , took his first plural wife , fanny alger , in kirtland , ohio . smith and alger ultimately separated , and the church relocated to nauvoo , ill. , where he married many more women . the oldest was 56 , and the youngest was 14-year-old helen mar kimball ; some were already married , a revelation the new york times describes as the " biggest bombshell for some . " the essay explains that a number of marriages , including that with kimball , were sealed " for eternity alone , " suggesting sexual relations were n't involved ( the ones that did involve sex were " for time and eternity " ) . what did emma think of all this ? per the essay , she was none too pleased , though at one time she did accept four of smith 's wives into their home . and what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the " wrenching trial " of polygamy ? kimball said smith told her that " the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the saints would ever have to test their faith . " two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church 's later years ; they 're part of an effort the church is making to share " reliable , faith-promoting " info about its past , the church 's historian tells the times . ( part of that effort : an explanation of its undergarments . )
