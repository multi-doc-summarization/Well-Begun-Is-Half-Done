argentinian president cristina fernandez de kirchner is in china today , where she met with president xi jinping to sign various agreements and spoke at a conference attended by 1,000 businessmen in an effort to raise chinese investment in argentina 's struggling economy . and yet , she still thought it would be a good idea to post a tweet mocking the chinese accent , bloomberg reports . the tweet , posted in spanish , translates as : " did they only come for lice and petloleum ? " she was referring to the businessmen ; bloomberg notes that the tweet was in response to criticism that she tends to crowd her supporters into events . she followed the original tweet up with , " sorry , do you know what ? the levels of ridiculousness and absurdity are so high they can only be digested with humor , " time reports . the presidential palace 's official twitter account retweeted that second tweet , but not the first . ( kirchner is really not having a good week . )
