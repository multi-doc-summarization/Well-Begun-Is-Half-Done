verizon yesterday unveiled its new " share everything " plans , in which families will share one data allowance on a family plan rather than each member having his or her own data allowance on separate plans . despite the fact that verizon is touting this as a money-saving opportunity for families , critics run the numbers and say it 's actually not : dan rowinski of readwriteweb finds that one hypothetical family of four will likely pay exactly the same amount per month , or may save at most $ 10 per month . the problem ? data may be cheaper under the new plans , but " you pay more per device , " he explains . " verizon 's new plan does not give families a discount . the difference amounts to an administrative change . " troy wolverton goes a bit further in the mercury news , calling the new plans " a crummy deal for many consumers . " he finds that many users will actually end up paying more , since the only real price breaks are on talk minutes and text messages— " services [ consumers ] are already using less . " " overall , the move appears to be a price hike tarted up to look consumer friendly , " he writes . all the critics concede that the new plans are certainly simpler to understand , but on zdnet , matthew miller is " disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price . " if sprint gets its lte network running , it will be an " attractive " option for individual unlimited plans at $ 80 per phone , he notes . on cnet , roger cheng points out that verizon is now " forcing " unlimited voice and text messages with these plans . " under the change , customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever , " he writes . " it 's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you do n't need , and taking away what you do—all for a higher price . " the new plans roll out on june 28 , and the only way to keep your existing plan is to upgrade to new phones at full cost , with no discount .
