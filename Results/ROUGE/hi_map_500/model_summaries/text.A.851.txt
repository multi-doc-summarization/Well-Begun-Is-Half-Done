one of the more widely used images from today 's shooting spree near the empire state building shows a wounded man on the street being being tended to by a woman . turns out it was shot by local photographer muhammad malik , who immediately uploaded it to instagram with this not-so-sensitive caption , a play off of lyrics by nas : " they shoot , aw made you look ! no really tho . dude got popped ! " that drew plenty of online criticism , as did his facebook boasts ( complete with hashtag # chaching ) about cashing in on the photo . " let 's be clear everyone , i did n't shoot anyone , i just took a photo , do n't hate me , hate the actions that caused me to get a picture like that , " he wrote in response . " it 's cameras that allow all of us to see what 's going on in parts that we would never venture into or otherwise would n't think twice about . " when daily intel caught up with him , a " more subdued " malik said he would " probably not " make any money from the image . " i do n't think it was insensitive , " he said . " it 's new york , i just took a photo . " as for that caption , " it was just a comment . "
