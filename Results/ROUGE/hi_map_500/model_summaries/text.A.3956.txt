fart jokes are available on 3,000-year-old sumerian stone tablets but apparently not on apple 's latest piece of 21st-century technology . the developer of fart watch , a whoopee cushion-inspired app that boasts it can " turn your apple watch and iphone into a remote-controlled fart machine , " tells cult of mac that apple told him it had been rejected , because the company noticed it " is primarily a fart app " and " we do not accept fart apps on apple watch . " it appears that fart apps go against the " sophisticated , elegant image " apple wants for the watch , writes chris mills at gizmodo , but it 's " probably just a matter of time until someone jailbreaks the watch , and sideloading galore can begin . " ( a french inventor says he can make farts smell like rosesâ€”or chocolate . )
