after four years of mapping our planet 's gravity , the european space agency 's goce satellite has plunged back to earth . the goce—gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer—was last heard from 75 miles over antarctica , reuters reports . it is believed to have burned up on re-entry , with hundreds of pounds of surviving debris scattering somewhere in the western pacific . its gradiometer , the instrument used to make gravity measurements , is made of materials tough enough to survive the fall to earth , the bbc notes . goce—the planet 's lowest-flying scientific satellite—mapped earth 's gravitational field in never-before-seen detail , revealing how gravity 's pull is uneven across the world . the satellite 's fall to earth , which was inevitable after it ran out of fuel a few weeks ago , was the esa 's first uncontrolled re-entry in decades . but since goce was relatively light at 1.2 tons , it did n't attract the same attention as other recent re-entries , including the crash of a failed russian probe last year .
