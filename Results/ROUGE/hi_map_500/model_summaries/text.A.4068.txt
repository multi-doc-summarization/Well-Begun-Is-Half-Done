it ’ s official : mahmoud abbas will demand full un membership from the security council next week , despite an almost certain veto from the us . abbas formally committed to the gambit for the first time in a speech today , the new york times reports , saying that “ we need a state , a seat at the united nations , and nothing more. ” the us had hoped it could talk abbas out of the move . but the ap notes that abbas downplayed expectations , saying the move wouldn ’ t grant palestine its independence . “ the occupation will not come to an end , ” he said . “ but we will at least have recognition that we are under occupation , and not a disputed territory as israel says. ” he also said that he wasn ’ t trying to isolate or delegitimize israel , according to the jerusalem post . “ israel is there , no one can isolate or take away its legal status , ” he said , “ but we need to isolate the policies of israel . ”
