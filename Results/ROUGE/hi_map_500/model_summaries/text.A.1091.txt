jim vidmar has rather unusual job : he oversees 10,000 fake twitter accounts . and the las vegas man has been at it for six years , using a dozen computers and a slew of accounts to help beef up the followings of his 50-or-so clients , who pay him to help them seem more popular and important , reports the wall street journal . and the accounts have gotten more sophisticated : in april , a tough new filter was applied , and the majority of vidmar 's accounts were wiped from the site . and so the vendors that sell the fakes to vidmar put a little more work into them : the fakes now feature photos , profile details , and tweet a number of times before he buys them ; he got 1,000 for $ 58 from a pakistan supplier this month . from there , he has the accounts tweet , retweet , follow , and messageâ€”all in the name of clients like " rapper/singer/producer/guitarist/fitness model " dave murrell aka @ fyrare ( number of twitter followers : 238,360 ) . murrell has tried twitter ads , but says he gets more bang for his buck with vidmar . murrell does n't exactly express any qualms : " if you 're not padding your numbers , you 're not doing it right . it 's part of the game . " and it 's not just follower count that can be affected : client tony benson ( aka rapper philly chase ) says vidmar 's fake accounts pushed him onto the " trending topics " list and eventually sparked the noticed of philadelphia media . buying and selling both accounts and followers is , of course , barred by twitter 's terms of service , but vidmar notes he has never been contacted or threatened with legal action by twitter .
