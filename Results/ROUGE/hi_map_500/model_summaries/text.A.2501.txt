troops headed for the us-mexico border are n't just aiming to help prevent migrant entry—they have unregulated militias and criminal organizations on their minds , too . according to planning documents obtained by newsweek , the department of defense is aware of nearly 200 armed militias already operating along the southwest border . " reported incidents of unregulated militias stealing national guard equipment during deployments , " reads an intelligence assessment for the pentagon by the joint force land component commander threat working group . " they operate under the guise of citizen patrols supporting cbp [ customs and border protection ] primarily between poes [ points of entry ] . " the documents analyze four points of entry including one in brownsville , texas , and another in the san ysidro district of san diego , calif . the assessment jibes with media reports that militia members are already heading for the border , the washington post reports . they include the texas minutemen , who apparently have 100 armed volunteers going to the rio grande . " i can ’ t put a number on it , " says shannon mcgauley , who leads the group . " my phone ’ s been ringing nonstop for the last seven days . " meanwhile , members of another group—the patriots of the constitution militia—arrived last week in columbus , new mexico , per the albuquerque journal . yet the military planners expect the migrant caravan to reduce in size and contain " no terrorist infiltration , " per the documents . they also say the migrants could trigger a " balloon effect " on smuggling if traffickers take advantage of the diversion . ( while providing troops , the pentagon refused one request from trump . )
