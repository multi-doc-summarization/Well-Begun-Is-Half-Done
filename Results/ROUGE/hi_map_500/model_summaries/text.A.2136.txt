the syrian boy who drew worldwide attention last august after he was bloodied by an airstrike in aleppo has resurfaced looking like any other healthy 5-year-old . but some are cautioning that looks can be deceiving . in interviews with pro-government outlets—including reporter kinana allouche , who once shared a selfie with the bodies of rebel fighters—omran daqneesh is seen next to his father as the older man accuses rebels of using omran as a propaganda tool . " they wanted to trade in his blood and published his photos , " he says , per the bbc . mohamad daqneesh , who lost an older son in the airstrike , adds he refused rebel offers to leave aleppo because the rebels only seek to hurt the reputation of the syrian army , per mashable . allouche notes " those who tried to shed syrian blood mislead the news that he was hit by the syrian arab army . here he now lives in the syrian state with its army , its leader and its people . " the interview marks a decided turn for the regime of bashar al-assad , who last year said the photo of omran in an ambulance was " forged . " but a rep for the syria institute suspects a propaganda campaign has only just begun and says the family was " probably " coerced . since rebels withdrew from aleppo in december , " they are under government control now and this is a government that we know arrests and tortures anyone that speaks out against it , " the rep tells reuters . the assad regime is known to offer incentives to those who speak out against rebels , reports the guardian .
