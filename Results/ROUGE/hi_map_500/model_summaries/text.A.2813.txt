you can expect your waiter to ask all kinds of questions when he approaches the table , but , " can i see your proof of residency ? " is not among them . nevertheless , that 's what four female diners experienced at the upscale saint marc restaurant in huntington beach , calif. , earlier this month , reports the orange county register . one of them , 23-year-old brenda carrillo , recalls to the los angeles times that she was dumbfounded as the waiter elaborated , " i need to make sure you 're from here before i can serve you . " the four women complained to a manager and left the restaurant , and carrillo 's sister , diana , then posted about their treatment online . after the post began drawing reactions , the restaurant apologized online and said the waiter had been fired . " in no way are the actions of this former employee representative of the saint marc brand nor are they reflective of the opinions of anyone else on our team , including executive management , " said a restaurant statement . a saint marc exec says the waiter explained that he meant the question as a joke , but the women say he clearly did not . saint marc offered to bring the women back for vip treatment and donate 10 % of the night 's proceeds to a charity of their choice . they declined the first but asked that the money go to a group that helps undocumented immigrants . the carrillo sisters , described by brenda as " light-skinned latinas , " do not fall into that category , for the record . they were born and raised in california . " it sends a chill through your entire body , " says diana of the incident . ( read another story of dining-gone-wrong in california . )
