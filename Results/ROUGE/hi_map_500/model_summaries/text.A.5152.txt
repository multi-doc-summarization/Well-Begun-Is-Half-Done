in what one conservationist is calling an " environmental nightmare , " an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 atlantic salmon busted out of their holding pen over the weekend after a net broke , and the washington department of fish and wildlife is now pleading with locals to help catch as many as they can . cooke aquaculture 's net pen was holding around 305,000 farmed salmon when anchor lines to the pen gave way and service walkways tipped on saturday , reports the seattle times . the wdfw is now asking for the public 's help in scooping the escaped fish out of the waters near cypress island ( or wherever they may turn up ) , with no size or quantity restrictions . the exodus has environmentalists concerned , as they 're afraid the farmed escapees could take over the feeding and spawning grounds of native chinook and steelhead salmon and pass on disease , kuow notes . cooke says in a statement that " exceptionally high tides and currents coinciding with this week 's solar eclipse " contributed to the " structural failure " that led to the salmon 's breakout . but environmentalists are pushing back on that , king 5 notes , with one organization claiming cooke had the same net issue earlier this summer . kuow also reports that tide tables and current and wind speed numbers were n't unusually high on saturday . a cooke spokeswoman doubled down on the eclipse explainer late tuesday , and she also added that the escaped salmon were n't a threat to native fish because they would n't survive . " it 's primarily a business loss , " she tells the times . the salmon , which weigh about 10 pounds each , " will be food for the seals and the fishermen can enjoy them . " ( is california 's salmon population in big trouble ? )
