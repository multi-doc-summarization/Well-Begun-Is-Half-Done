united airlines ' treatment of a passenger who was forcibly removed from an overbooked flight is the final straw , writes adam clark estes on gizmodo : it 's time for a boycott . " there are plenty of other airlines out there that don ’ t abuse passengers and refuse to apologize , " estes writes . " other airlines will gladly take your money and make sure you get to your destination without enlisting a muscleman to slam your head into an armrest and forcibly remove you from the plane so that one of its employees can get a free flight . " this , by the way , is " just the latest in an increasingly enraging pattern of bad behavior by the airline " ; other reasons to boycott united include , but are not limited to , the time united diverted a flight to kick off an autistic child and the time it refused to give an unopened can of soda to a muslim chaplain on one of its flights . estes is far from the only person outraged—sasha lekach at mashable calls united 's attempts at apologizing for the situation " meaningless corporate jargon " that just enraged people more . at the los angeles times , michael hiltzik says united 's handling of the entire incident was " botched " and shameful , but notes that the real problem is that the law allows airlines to overbook , even at risk of a situation like this . " how many businesses do you know of that can sell you a good or service , accept payment , and then withdraw that good or service unilaterally for their own purposes—much less by force ? " at slate , daniel gross calls the overbooking system airlines use " ridiculous " and " outdated , " and notes that lately , more passengers than usual are getting bumped from overbooked flights , a fair number of them involuntarily : it 's time for " a better way , " he writes . if you find yourself in the same unfortunate situation as the united passenger , quartz offers up an explainer of what you 're legally entitled to .
