the " leading from behind " theme looks to be emerging as a conservative line of attack against president obama . the phrase comes from an obama adviser describing the libya strategy in a new yorker piece on foreign policy by ryan lizza . ( read it here . ) the gist is that obama is a pragmatist who recognizes that us power is declining and that a lot of people hate us . " pursuing our interests and spreading our ideals thus requires stealth and modesty as well as military strength , " writes lizza . it 's the anti-john-wayne approach , adds the obama adviser quoted earlier . yesterday , charles krauthammer weighed in at the washington post , criticizing the piece for turning a " foreign policy of hesitation " into a doctrine . " leading from behind is not leading , " krauthammer writes . " it is abdicating . " now william kristol at the weekly standard is on the case , sarcastically thanking lizza for making clear that obama is " shepherding " the country through this age of " appeasement and decline . " he wants republicans to take note : " how do you defeat a leader from behind ? with a leader from the front . " the party , therefore , needs a " workhorse , not a show horse . "
