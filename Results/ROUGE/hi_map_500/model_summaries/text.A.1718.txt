police are no longer seeking the whereabouts of a blue porsche after a quadruple murder in an upscale washington , dc , neighborhoodâ€”but they 've released video of a " person of interest " who may have been driving it before it was found burning behind a church . in surveillance video , a hooded figure in dark clothing can be seen moving outside the house where savvas and amy savopoulos were found dead after a fire on thursday , nbc washington reports . two other bodies found in the home are believed to be the couple 's 10-year-old son , philip , and veralicia figueroa , one of their housekeepers . their other housekeeper , nelitza gutierrez , tells the washington post that she thought something odd was going on wednesday when she received messages asking her not to come in the next day . gutierrez says savvas savopoulos gave conflicting information in different messages and sounded unlike himself . " it was something very suspicious because i felt his voice was really tense , " she tells the post . " and it was different than what he had said to me before . " she says she also found it strange that savopoulos said figueroa was spending the night at the home , something she had never known to happen before . deepening the mystery , police documents seen by the post detail some strange events in the surrounding area that week , including reports of a possible prowler , a man banging at the door of a home , and an " aggressive vacuum cleaner salesman " at another home .
