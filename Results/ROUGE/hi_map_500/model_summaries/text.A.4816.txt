pitbull 's marketing deal with walmart may backfire on him : the miami rapper is getting sent to whichever walmart store gets the most " likes " on its facebook page , and right now the store in the lead is in â€¦ kodiak , alaska , population just north of 6,000 . that 's because boston phoenix writer and somethingawful.com founder david thorpe figured it would be hilarious to get people to purposely like the kodiak store in order to exile pitbull to the remote island location , rolling stone reports . the kodiak walmart had more than 35,000 likes yesterday , and even has its own twitter campaign : # exilepitbull . " i know pitbull is hoping his miami walmart shoppers start liking their facebook page , " a rep for the company tells the ap , but they only have until july 16 to vote and it will be an uphill battle : one miami location had just 45 likes yesterday . the rapper is taking it all in stride , tweeting , " i hear there 's bear repellant at kodiak , alaska @ walmartspecials @ sheets # exilepitbull .
