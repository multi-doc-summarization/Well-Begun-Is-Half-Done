vladimir putin is paying back the us for what he says is its " insolence " in approving new sanctions against russia , kicking american diplomats out of the country by september and shuttering the us embassy 's recreational compound ( aka " dacha " ) just outside moscow . that payback apparently includes not letting the diplomats get their stuff out first , per reuters , which reports that a news agency cameraman spotted five vehicles sporting diplomatic license plates drive up to the retreat monday , only to be turned away . " the us mission to russia was supposed to have access to our dacha until noon on august 1 , " an embassy spokeswoman says , citing an agreement with the russian government . " we have not had access all day today or yesterday . we refer you to the russian government to explain why not . " the russian government does n't deny the deadline , but it 's taking issue with the us ' side of things . per the ria state news agency , a russian foreign ministry rep says the property—which the moscow times describes as a " 2,000-square-meter warehouse in an industrial area " —is in a conservation area , and so the trucks used by the americans ca n't enter without proper permits ( the official says three of those vehicles were industrial-sized cargo trucks , per rt.com ) . the official also scoffs at the suggestion russia was flat-out barring the us from the dacha , noting that assertion was a " premeditated provocation . " meanwhile , us ambassador to russia john tefft gathered all moscow embassy staff to inform them of russia 's decision , which includes slashing 755 roles at us diplomatic missions . " the atmosphere was like a funeral , " one unnamed source said , per the independent .
