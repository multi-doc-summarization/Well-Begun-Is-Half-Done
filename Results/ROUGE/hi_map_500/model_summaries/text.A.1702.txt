" when a car passed , you could hear how close it was , you could hear the metal , " ethan tells ntv . " i got really , really scared , and i just started praying a lot . " mackenzie says they had told their father multiple times they did n't want to go with him because he was " really drunk " and they did n't " want to die . " the children say they begged behrens to pull over , but he ignored them . then , after barely escaping a head-on collision , they started texting 911 . fortunately , they were in one of only two nebraska counties that allow people to do that . they convinced behrens to stop at a burger king , and police caught up with them there . police say behrens was three times over the legal limit , and he was arrested . ethan and mackenzie say it was hard to call the police on their dad , but they had no choice , and this was n't the first time he 's driven drunk with them . the new york daily news reports the incident happened last month , but the kids are speaking out now to thank police .
