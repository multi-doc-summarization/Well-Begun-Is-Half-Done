despite us pleas to rethink proposed legislation regulating holocaust speech , poland 's senate went ahead and passed the bill , reports the bbc . the legislation has sparked a diplomatic dispute with israel , and the us had argued that it could hurt freedom of speech as well as strategic relationships . us state department spokeswoman heather nauert voiced her government 's concerns as the polish senate was preparing to approve the bill wednesday ; the bill later passed by 57 votes to 23 . the measure next needs to be signed into law by the president , who supports it . poland 's conservative ruling law and justice party authored the bill , which calls for up to three years in prison for any intentional attempt to falsely attribute the crimes of nazi germany to the polish state or people , the ap reports . law and justice says it is fighting against the use of phrases like " polish death camps " to refer to death camps operated by nazi germany in occupied poland during world war ii . israel , however , sees the move as an attempt to whitewash the role some poles played in the killing of jews during world war ii . nauert said the us understands that phrases like " polish death camps " are " inaccurate , misleading , and hurtful , " but voiced concern the legislation could " undermine free speech and academic discourse . " members of poland 's jewish community also weighed in wednesday , saying in an open letter that they strongly oppose usage of the phrase " polish death camps , " but also oppose the law .
