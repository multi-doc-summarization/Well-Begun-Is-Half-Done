iran thinks it 's poised to finally bury the hatchet with the us and strike a sanctions-ending nuclear dealâ€”because officials believe president obama offered that kind of rapprochement in his letter to newly-elected moderate hasan rouhani , a top iranian adviser tells the new york times . in iran 's reading , obama offered face-to-face talks and promised to lift sanctions if rouhani demonstrates a willingness to " keep your commitments and remove ambiguities . " but washington 's interpretation is much less dramatic ; an official says obama was n't necessarily promising leader-to-leader talks , or any specific sanction action . rouhani wants to strike a quick deal in the next six months , before parliamentary elections begin . the normally politically powerful military is currently defanged , and ayatollah khamenei appears to be on board . in the meantime rouhani 's on a charm offensive . he wrote an op-ed in today 's washington post in which he offers to " help facilitate dialogue between the syrian government and the opposition , " and promises an attempt to " move beyond impasses " with regard to iran 's nuclear program . he 's on the interview circuit as well , with one coming up with charlie rose . next week he 'll give his first un address , and for once the us may not walk out , the post reports . obama is speaking the same day , so the two might even meet .
