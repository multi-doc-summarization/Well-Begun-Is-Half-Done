the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has promised to diversify its membershipâ€”but making good on that promise is slow-going : a los angeles times analysis of 5,800 of the academy 's 6,261 voting members shows that 91 % are white and 76 % are male , only a slight improvement from 2012 , when 94 % of voters were white and 77 % were male . what 's more , the academy 's executive branch is 98 % white and its public relations branch is 95 % white . meanwhile , about 87 % of lead actors , 87 % of directors , and 92 % of writers for the top 163 films of 2014 were white , according to a new ucla study , per the washington post . " what does n't interest them is the current black experience or black culture , " filmmaker rod lurie says of the academy , which hands out its annual honors on sunday . " a movie like straight outta compton does n't stand a chance . " the ucla study also found that women directed only 3 % of 2014 's major films . the academy says it will double the number of women and minority voters ( now 1,500 and 535 , respectively ) by 2020 .
