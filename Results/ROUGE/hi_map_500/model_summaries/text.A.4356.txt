a chimpanzee that famously knocked a flying drone out of the air with a stick earlier this year was n't reacting out of fear or annoyance but rather executing a pre-planned and deliberate attack . that 's according to a new study in primates . " this episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts , " researcher bas lukkenaar says in a press release . the christian science monitor reports a dutch tv crew was using the drone to film a documentary on the chimps at the royal burgers ' zoo in april . after a test-run with the drone , the chimps started collecting sticks and climbing scaffolding . when the drone returned , a chimp named tushi was ready , swiping it out of the air with a 6-foot branch . while studying footage from the busted drone , researchers focused on tushi 's facial expression during the attack , nbc news reports . they found the grimace she makes before and during the incident is similar to what humans do while carrying out a predetermined use of force . according to the press release , the lack of fear in tushi 's expression means she was n't simply attacking out of reflex . the monitor explains it 's the difference between a calculated plan and swatting at a mosquito . this is n't unusual behavior for the chimps at burgers ' zoo ; they 've taught themselves to use 13 different types of tools , the press release states . ( now find out how chimps are more advanced than humans . )
