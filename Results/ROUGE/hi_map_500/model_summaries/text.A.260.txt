a haitian red cross official estimated today that 45,000 to 50,000 people perished in the shattering earthquake tuesday , as president obama pledged us support of $ 100 million for what he said is likely to be one of the biggest relief efforts in history . desperately needed aid began arriving from around the world this morning , the washington post reports . an air china plane carrying a chinese search-and-rescue team , medics , and tons of food and medicine landed at port-au-prince airport before dawn , along with three french planes with aid and a mobile hospital , officials said . a british relief team arrived in neighboring dominican republic , the ap reports . bodies lay everywhere in port-au-prince , as survivors , many severely injured , set up camps , salvaging mattresses , plastic chairs , bits of cardboard and food from the rubble . others streamed on foot into the haitian countryside , where wooden and cinderblock shacks showed little sign of damage , passing ambulances and un trucks racing in the opposite direction . " this is much worse than a hurricane , " said a doctor 's assistant working at a makeshift triage center set up in a hotel parking lot . " there 's no water . there 's nothing . thirsty people are going to die . "
