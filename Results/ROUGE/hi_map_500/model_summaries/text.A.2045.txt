it 's the kind of art project that even people who hate art projects can love : a german artist has hidden about $ 16,000 worth of gold bars on a beach in folkestone , england , reports the guardian . lucky treasure hunters can keep any they find . artist michael sailstorfer calls the project folkestone digs , and the curator of the folkestone triennial art festival , of which the project is a part , says he 's interested in seeing what people do with the gold . " do you take it to the pawnbrokers or do you take it to sotheby 's ? " he asks . " or do you keep it on the mantlepiece because you think it is going to be worth more later ? " it 's likely too late for any curious americans to take up the hunt . the art project was unveiled thursday , and about 150 people began digging for the 30 gold bars when the tide went out , reports the bbc . it 's not clear how many have been found , however , because participants do n't need to report in . " we will never know if the gold has been found or not , " says the curator . he adds that organizers are hoping diggers will create art—in the form of sandcastles—while searching . " it is a participatory artwork , " he says . " some people will get lucky , some people will not get lucky—and that 's life . " ( americans who want to search for hidden treasure should check this mysterious book out . )
