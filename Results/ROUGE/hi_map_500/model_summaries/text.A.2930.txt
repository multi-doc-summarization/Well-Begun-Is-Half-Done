the height and weight of a newborn baby is largely governed by his or her own genes , but it 's the height of the mother that 's giving researchers a telltale sign , reports the telegraph . specifically , shorter women have shorter pregnancies and thus more premature babies , report investigators at the march of dimes prematurity research center ohio collaborative in the journal plos medicine . the team analyzed 3,485 nordic women and their babies , and found that a woman 's height actually shapes the fetal environment , thereby influencing the length of her pregnancy . this has broad health implications around the world , where 15 million babies are born prematurely every year and more than 1 million of them die due to complications of early birthâ€”which include breathing problems , vision loss , and intellectual delays , report researchers in a press release . " that a woman 's height influences gestational length , independent of the genes she passes on that determine fetal size , is a major finding by our research networks , and the first of what we expect to be many genetic contributions , " one researcher says . ( premature birth is now the world 's top killer of children under 5 . )
