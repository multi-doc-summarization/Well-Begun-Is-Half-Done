a new study says america 's wealthy live longer than its poor , which is hardly surprising . but it also says low-income people live longer in certain placesâ€”like affluent cities including new york and san francisco , npr reports . why is n't clear , but lead study author raj chetty of stanford university was surprised . " i would have thought these very expensive big cities ... for most poor would be stressful and would be places with poor health among the poor , but that 's not at all what these data suggest , " he tells cbs news . media reports note that local health policies may have an effect ( new york city and san francisco banned trans fats and restricted tobacco use early on ) , and chetty agrees that " thinking about policies that change health behaviors at a local level is likely to be important . " the study 's other findings highlight the crushing effects of inequality . by analyzing over a billion tax and social security records , the stanford researchers found that the richest 1 % of men live roughly 15 years longer than the poorest 1 % of men . and in the 21st century , life expectancy has risen 2.3 years for the richest 5 % of men and 3 years for the richest 5 % of women , while the poorest 5 % of americans saw hardly any improvement . an overall three-year boost in lifespan , the washington post notes , is about the difference we 'd expect to see from curing cancer . as chetty puts it , " the poorest men in america have a life expectancy comparable to those living in sudan and pakistan . " ( one study says that eating like the japanese will make you live longer . )
