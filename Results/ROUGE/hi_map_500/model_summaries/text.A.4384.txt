turns out all that fanfare over the end of american idol was a bit premature . the singing competition is coming back after all , just not on its original network . abc will revive the show next season after reportedly outbidding nbc and fox ( which canceled it last year due in part to flagging ratings ) , entertainment weekly reports . in its official announcement , abc got in a couple little digs at fox : " american idol is a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon , " says abc entertainment president channing dungey . " abc is the right home to reignite the fan base . " " idol is an entertainment icon , and now it will air where it belongs , in abc â€™ s lineup of addictive fan favorites , " adds disney co-chairman ben sherwood ( disney owns abc ) . " america , get ready for the return of a bigger , bolder , and better-than-ever idol . " the network does not yet have a host or judges lined up , though tmz reports ryan seacrest might be interested in returning as host . the speculation is that abc will launch a shortened season , starting next spring , on sunday nights , usa today reports . how excited is the general public ? well , not very . " american idol is back by popular demand ! ..oh wait there was no demand ? oh okay . american idol is just back then , " reads one tweet . another : " not real sure why anyone thinks bringing american idol back is a good idea . go ahead and keep it , we 're good . " meanwhile , jezebel compares the show to " that strange rash on your elbow that miraculously went away but then resurfaces . "
