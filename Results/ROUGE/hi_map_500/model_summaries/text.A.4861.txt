the name eastern ghouta may not be a familiar one , but the neighborhood near the syrian capital of damascus is now making international headlines for all the wrong reasons . the enclave of 22 communities happens to be the last opposition-controlled region near the capital , and it 's been the target of fierce bombing by syrian president bashar al-assad . on monday , airstrikes and artillery shelling killed about 100 people , including 20 children , reports the ap , citing stats from the syrian observatory for human rights and the civil defense group known as the white helmets . the details : assad 's strategy : with the civil war now in its seventh year , assad is looking to reclaim rebel-held territory through " an outright military victory instead of a negotiated settlement , " per the guardian . the bombardment could be paving the way for a ground assault against the two islamist factions that control the neighborhood of about 350,000 people , reports gulf news . one problem : this is a suburb with no international borders and thus is of little strategic value to world powers , explains the washington post . " as a result , there is no power broker such as turkey , russia or the united states to deploy ground troops or strike a backroom deal . "
