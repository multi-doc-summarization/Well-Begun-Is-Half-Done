" whip it " fans , sorry for the news : devo guitarist bob casale died yesterday of heart failure at age 61 , rolling stone reports . he helped form the new wave band with his brother gerald in 1973 and stayed on board for decades : " bob casale was there in the trenches with me from the beginning , " said gerald in a statement . " he was my level-headed brother , a solid performer and talented audio engineer , always giving more than he got . " gerald said bob was excited about performing with devo again , and his death " came as a total shock to us all . " the original devo members , who grew up in akron , ohio , formed the band after personally witnessing the 1970 kent state massacre . " we came of age in the middle of a huge cultural war , " said bob in an under the radar interview two years ago . " this country was basically in the midst of a new civil war—the lines were drawn very clearly . " the band had a hit in 1980 with " whip it , " broke up in 1991 , got back together five years later , and toured for years after . their name was based on the idea of " de-evolution " —that people were devolving into a mass-herd mentality . " de-evolution happened and now everybody agrees , " gerald told cnn . " they do n't think we 're crazy . they know that it was true . "
