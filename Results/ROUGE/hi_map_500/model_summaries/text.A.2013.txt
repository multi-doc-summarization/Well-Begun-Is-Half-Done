the big question in iraq today : will nouri al-maliki go quietly ? as expected , president fouad massoum snubbed the two-term prime minister and said he must step down to make way for someone new . massoum picked deputy parliament speaker haider al-ibadi to be the next pm and gave him 30 days to form a government , reports the ap . " now the iraqi people are in your hands , " said massoum . the move comes after maliki addressed the nation at midnight and insisted that he be allowed to remain in office because his is the largest bloc in parliament , reports the new york times . he even deployed troops in the capital as a show of force . but those actions may have only hurt his cause further , reports the washington post . it quotes a kurdish politician who says the speech triggered a " major defection " today against maliki within his shiite coalition . " we have passed the stage of military coups and taking power by force , " says hoshyar zebari . the us , which has long seen maliki as too polarizing , has already made clear that it expects maliki to abide by massoum 's decision and warned against any use of force . ( meanwhile , iraq is still battling militants from the islamic state . )
