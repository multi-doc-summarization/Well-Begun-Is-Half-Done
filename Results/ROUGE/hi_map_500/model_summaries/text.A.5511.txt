first it was the kids of flint found to have been tainted by lead , attributed by many to the area 's toxic water . now two dogs who live in the vicinity of the michigan city have tested positive for lead toxicityâ€”the first two pups to be confirmed with this in state records in five years , the detroit free press reports . " here in michigan , specifically in [ genesee ] county , we 've had two cases of high-lead levels reported to us in dogs in the last six months , " state vet dr. james averill tells cbs detroit . " one was last fall and one was here in january . " he says that one of the affected dogs was a stray , while the other was a pet . both dogs are alive , averill notes , but the state report does n't specify how high their lead levels were , or what symptoms they had . and indeed , it 's challenging to diagnose dogs with lead toxicity , as symptoms such as " mental dullness , " arthritis , and lethargy can mimic those of other illnesses , averill says . instead , he mentions keeping an eye on variations in a pet 's routine to help pinpoint if something 's wrong . he does note to cbs , however , that the " vast majority " of lead tests on area dogs have come back negative , and he says they 're relying on local veterinarians with " boots on the ground " to look out for suspicious cases . in the meantime , while averill gives the ok to bathe pets in flint-area tap water , he says they should be drinking filtered or bottled water or , as a last resort , melted snow . " it would be safer , if your only other choice is feeding them straight flint water , " he notes . ( the fbi 's now on flint 's case . )
