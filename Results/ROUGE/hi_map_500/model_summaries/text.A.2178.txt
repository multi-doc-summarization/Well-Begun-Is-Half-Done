the latest republican effort to repeal the affordable care act may very well be dead after sen. john mccain announced his opposition to it friday , the ap reports . " i can not in good conscience vote for the graham-cassidy proposal , " cnn quotes mccain as saying in a statement . " i believe we could do better working together , republicans and democrats , and have not yet really tried . " this would be the second time mccain has put a nail in the coffin of republican efforts to end obamacare . mccain said he could n't vote for the graham-cassidy bill without a cbo score , which would n't be available until later this month , to let him know " how much it will cost , how it will affect insurance premiums , and how many people will be helped or hurt by it . " republicans could only afford to have two senators side with democrats in opposition to the bill . sen. rand paul was already opposed and sen. susan collins was leaning that way . a recent poll found only 24 % of americans support the graham-cassidy bill and 50 % disapprove of it , the hill reports .
