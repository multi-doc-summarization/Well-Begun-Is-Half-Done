we humans consume a lot of antidepressants , and that means birds inadvertently do the same while feeding at sewage plants . now researchers in the uk suggest that it 's taking a toll on the birds ' libidos , making them—or at least the females—less attractive to prospective mates . in their study , researchers at the university of york focused on starlings in captivity . they fed the birds worms laced with prozac , on par with what their counterparts in the wild might pick up while eating worms and insects at sewage plants , and then watched what happened . dosed males did n't change much , but dosed females suddenly seemed less attractive to the boys . male starlings sang less frequently to them and treated them more aggressively—pecking , tugging at feathers—than is typical in the wooing phase . it 's " the first evidence that low concentrations of an antidepressant can disrupt the courtship of songbirds , " says study co-author kathryn arnold in a release . " we 're definitely not saying that it 's bad to take antidepressants , but certainly there is a greater need for new technologies to clean out sewage , " she elaborates to the washington post . presumably , the same type of behavior occurs in the wild , but researchers note that it 's hard to replicate for a not-so-great reason : wild birds are dining not just on prozac but on a whole cocktail of pharmaceuticals , and the study adds to evidence that growing concentrations of them " can alter important traits related to individual fitness and population dynamics , " per the study .
