want to know what 's wrong with the corporate publishing industry ? take a look at lena dunham 's insane book deal , which rob spillman pegs at $ 3.7 million on salon . random house will need to sell at least 500,000 copies to break even , which spillman thinks is a long shot . but even if the company pulls it off , " is this any way to run a publishing company ? " spillman wonders . " put aside the cultural impact question for a second . the whole approach seems short-sighted at best . " imagine if random house had taken that $ 3.7 million and instead given $ 10,000 advances to 370 writers—or even $ 100,000 advances to 37 writers . surely a few of the resulting books would have been better and more successful than dunham 's book , and a few of the writers would have outsold her over time . but " this argument presumes time . which is what corporate publishers don ’ t have , " spillman explains . " they have shareholders , and/or parent companies , and must justify their quarterly earnings . " that 's why small publishers are increasingly winning the big literary awards after taking chances on books that the major houses wo n't touch . " random house ’ s rash deal with dunham is … why the corporate publishers are losing cultural relevance , and why they might soon lose solvency as well .
