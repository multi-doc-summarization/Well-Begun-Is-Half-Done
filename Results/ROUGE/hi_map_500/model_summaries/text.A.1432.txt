colin kaepernick , still unsigned six weeks into the nfl season , believes he is being blackballed for his role in protests during the national anthem and has filed a grievance against nfl owners . the former san francisco 49ers quarterback became a free agent at the end of last season and has failed to land a contract despite impressive statistics and injuries to other quarterbacks . his complaint accuses team owners of collusion , which sports illustrated defines as what happens when " two or more teams , or the league and at least one team , join to deprive a player of a contractually earned right , " including the right of a free-agent player to negotiate a contract . last year , kaepernick was the first player to protest racial injustice by refusing to stand for the anthem . if the nfl is to remain a meritocracy , " principled and peaceful political protest ... should not be punished , " his attorney , mark geragos , said in a statement , per bleacher report . kaepernick 's grievance was filed under the latest collective bargaining agreement and the nfl player 's union says it is supporting him . former 49ers teammate eric reid , who started kneeling during the anthem soon after kaepernick began his protest , tells the ap that it " sure seems like he is being blackballed . " " i think all the stats prove that he 's an nfl-worthy quarterback , " he says . " so that 's his choice and i support his decision . "
