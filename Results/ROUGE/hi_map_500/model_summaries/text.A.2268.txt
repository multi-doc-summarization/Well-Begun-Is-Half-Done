swedish doctors are advancing in their quest to implant embryos in women who have received pioneering womb implants , the guardian reports . a medical team in gothenburg has successfully transferred embryos to four of nine women with implants , a major advance after transferring just one embryo in january . mats brannstrom , who leads the team , would n't say if any of the women are pregnant , and a study by the group said four women experienced " mild rejection episodes " ; in fact , two had their uterus removed due to complications . " one or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry , and one or two wo n't be able to get pregnant , " said brannstrom , the ap reports . other doctors say the women must be carefully watched to see how well a transplanted uterus functions . " it is a good sign they have done the transfers , " said a doctor . " but a live birth will be the best validation that this works . " controversy has surrounded the swedish project because it accepted wombs from live women who are friends or family of the patients , creating possible health risks for the donors . two other womb transplant attempts , in turkey and saudi arabia , failed to produce a child ; only the turkish donation was from a dead donor .
