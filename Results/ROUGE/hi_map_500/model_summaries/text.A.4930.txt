in 1963 , a 23-year-old surveyor for the chinese peoples liberation army accidentally crossed the border into india . he remained stuck there for 54 years , making it back to his homeland only last week , reports the bbc . the strange tale of wang qi starts with a nighttime stroll away from camp . he told the bbc in a previous interview that he got lost and was " tired and hungry . " he found a red cross vehicle and asked for help , only to be turned over to the indian army . after nearly seven years in various jails , authorities relocated wang to a remote village , the hindustan times reports . he was not allowed to return to china , however , but nor was he given indian citizenship . he lived in a kind of limbo . " i cried in the night , " wang says of those first years in india . " i missed my mother . " he eventually married , worked at a flour mill , and had children and grandchildren , but he never stopped hoping to return home . a spokesperson for the chinese government blames indian bureaucracy for preventing wang 's return over the past half-century . but after being visited by a delegation from the chinese embassy in recent weeks , visas were procured for wang and his relatives . his wife was too sick to travel , but wang arrived in beijing on friday with his adult children , where they were met by his surviving relatives . this is only a visit , however . " my family is ( in india ) , " he says . " where would i go ? " ( for this soldier , wwii did n't end until 1974 . )
