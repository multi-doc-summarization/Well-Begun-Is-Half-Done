it 's easier to guess men 's intelligence than women 's just by looking at their faces—maybe because we 're so distracted by female beauty , according to a new study . czech researchers gave iq tests to 80 male and female students , took photos of them , and asked 160 students to rate them in order of attractiveness and perceived intelligence , psypost reports . generally , students deemed more attractive were also deemed smarter , especially among the women . little surprise there , but somehow the 160 students were more able to spot men 's actual iq . why is that ? maybe signs of higher intelligence are only visible in men 's faces " due to some genetic and developmental association , " the researchers write . " another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness , " which prevents " an accurate assessment of their intelligence . " what 's more , our ability to quickly identify a person 's iq may have " evolutionary " consequences , the researchers say , the daily mail reports . neat factoid : the study found that people hold a certain mental image of an intelligent person 's face—narrow , with a long nose and thin chin—which did n't correlate to actual iq .
