a florida mother says she brought her then-6-year-old daughter in for a dental appointment to get a tooth extracted with dr. howard schneider in 2014—but , instead , she came in to the procedure room to find her daughter " face-first " on the bloody floor with scratches , bruises , and all eight of her front teeth extracted . when brandi motley could n't get an attorney to take her case , she " turned her minivan into a rolling billboard attack on schneider , " abc news reports . then , in april 2015 , she posted about her experience on facebook , and the post went viral . she found other parents who said they 'd had similar experiences—they allege schneider , who catered to children in low-income families , performed unnecessary procedures , harming their kids in the process , in order to collect millions in medicaid funds—and they started protesting outside schneider 's clinic . ultimately , the attorney who 'd at first refused the case took on 131 individual lawsuits against schneider , settling 104 of them thus far , but schneider continues to insist he 's done nothing wrong . after the protests had been going on for weeks , schneider shut down his clinic after more than 50 years of practicing dentistry , and voluntarily gave up his dental license—which meant he avoided a full investigation by the dental board . in november 2015 , he was arrested and charged with 11 counts of medicaid provider fraud ; he pleaded not guilty and may go to trial , although his defense team is seeking to have the 78-year-old declared mentally incompetent in order to avoid a trial , news 4 jax reports . in may , usa today reported that some parents accuse schneider of going so far as to choke his patients into unconsciousness rather than using anesthetic .
