seniors had better brace themselves : some us hospitals are now administering the " death test , " which estimates an elderly patient 's chance of dying over the next 30 days . invented in australia , the test weighs 29 different criteria—including blood pressure , respiratory rate , and medical history—to determine whether hospitalization is worthwhile or the patient should return home or go to a hospice , the sydney morning herald reports . the idea is to prevent needless and expensive procedures while allowing patients to spend their last days with loved ones . " most terminally ill people want to die at home , but in fact three quarters end up dying in acute hospitals , often after intrusive , expensive , and ultimately pointless medical procedures , " says study author magnolia cardona-morrell , the independent reports . the test also aims to take pressure off doctors and nurses to prolong patients ' lives " at all costs , " the telegraph reports . " i had lots of nurses and doctors standing there saying , 'we have been waiting for a tool like this for years , when can we start using it ? ' " says cardona-morrell , whose work was presented recently at a us medical conference . " to me that is an indication there is a need out there . " she says the test takes just five or 10 minutes , and helps doctors have a more " transparent " conversation with patients . called cristal , it 's now being tested to see if it would have predicted the future of patients who have since died . then it may be used in more hospitals . ( in related news , a study says those who feel younger than their age will live longer . )
