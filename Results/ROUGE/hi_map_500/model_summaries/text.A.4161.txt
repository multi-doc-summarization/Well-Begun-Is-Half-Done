on nov. 7 , maine will take an unprecedented step for a state when it allows residents to vote on expanding medicaid under the affordable care act , the new york times reports . maine is one of 19 states where republicans have blocked medicaid expansion available under the aca . the maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand medicaid only to have gov . paul lepage veto expansion five times . however , if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month , lepage would be unable to veto it . if the referendum passes , approximately 80,000 more maine residents making up to 138 % of the poverty level will be eligible for medicaid . in addition to decreasing the number of uninsured maine residents , supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open . lepage , while attacking maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on friday , said it would take " resources away from our most vulnerable mainers " to " give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing , " the press herald reports . under the aca , at least 90 % of medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government . the other 18 states where medicaid expansion has been blocked are carefully watching what happens in maine . it 's estimated more than 2.5 million americans would gain access to health care if all 19 holdout states allowed medicaid expansion .
