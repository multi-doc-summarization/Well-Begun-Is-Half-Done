critics are divided on everybody ’ s fine : some think the family drama is okay because of robert de niro , and others think it ’ s awful despite him . what they ’ re saying : it ’ s “ a thoroughly fake movie that is about , of all things , the need for truthfulness , ” writes kirk honeycutt of the hollywood reporter . “ characters have no depth , and all emotions get ladled on via a syrupy score and de niro 's strenuous acting. ” rooting for these characters “ requires saintly moviegoing patience i clearly do n't have , ” says lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly , adding that the script was written “ under guidance , apparently , from dr. phil. ” de niro is “ very good , ” says bill goodykoontz of the arizona republic , but the film doesn ’ t trust its audience , and the ending is “ pure sap. ” it “ may well be fine , but it could have been a lot better. ” you may feel as if you ’ ve “ been run over by the pathos van , ” because the movie borders on “ emotional fraud. ” but it ’ s such a relief to see de niro " in a project that does not stink ” that michael phillips of the chicago tribune liked it anyway .
