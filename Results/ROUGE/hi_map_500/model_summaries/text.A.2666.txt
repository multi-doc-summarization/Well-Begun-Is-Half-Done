facebook is n't always used for good , but a connecticut woman whose puppy fell overboard is now giving the social media site a giant " like " after what happened over the weekend . clare shaw and her family were out on their boat sunday outside of noank when ryder , their 8-month-old shiba inu , somehow broke free of his harness and plunged into the water , per fox 61 . the panicked family , which was under the impression ryder could n't swim , called the coast guard and backtracked for hours looking for their pup , to no avail . " we felt defeated , " shaw says . " we packed up his things and lit a candle in his cage and assumed our boy lost his life drowning . " but shaw obviously did n't give up hope completely , because she decided to put up a now-deleted post on her facebook page asking if anyone had seen her precious pup , the epoch times reportsâ€”and it was after 100 shares or so of that post that the best news ever came her way . a horse vet saw her post , as well as a post in a local lost-and-found group , and put two and two together . phil bigelow and patrick jullarine , friends since they were 9 years old , had been out boating themselves on sunday and spotted a " shaking and scared " ryder in the sea , scooped him out , and nicknamed him nemo . bigelow says once he got home , he and his girlfriend picked up some snacks , a collar , and toys for their newfound furry friend " to make him feel loved " until his owners could be tracked down . shaw calls ryder 's save a " true miracle " and expressed her gratitude on facebook , via people . " the power of social media is out of this world , " she says . ( a mom found her long-lost son thanks to facebook . )
