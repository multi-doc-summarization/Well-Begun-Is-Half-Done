the southern avenger rides alone once more . jack hunter has left rand paul 's employ amidst a firestorm of controversy about his past as a confederate flag-wearing secessionist shock jock and columnist . hunter first broke the news to his friend w. james antle iii at the daily caller . " i 've long been a conservative , and years ago , a much more politically incorrect ( and campy ) one , " hunter said . " but there 's a significant difference between being politically incorrect and racist . " he intends to return to punditry . paul had previously stuck by hunter . " i think the things he said about john wilkes booth are absolutely stupid , " he told the huffington post two weeks ago . but " if i thought he was a white supremacist , he would be fired immediately . " instead it seems he 's been fired slowly . paul today said he and hunter had come to a " mutual decision " that he should leave . " i think everybody occasionally has people that work for them who sometimes have a background that damages what you â€™ re trying to do , " paul explained , according to cn|2 .
