in the deep south , a predilection for proper manners often means the temptation to tell someone off is replaced with a " bless your heart . " but an obituary that appeared last month in a north carolina newspaper flouted politeness , and at least one family member is n't happy , kdvr reports . the death notice for cornelia june rogers miller , who died in february , ran in murphy 's cherokee scout newspaper , and it was n't a flattering depiction of the great-grandmother , who " died alone after a long battle with drug addiction and depression . " " drugs were a major love in her life as june had no hobbies , made no contribution to society , and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life , " the obituary says . " we speak for the majority of her family when we say her presence will not be missed by many , very few tears will be shed , and there will be no lamenting over her passing . " all of which has her son , robert miller , fumingâ€”and he thinks he knows who placed the obituary . " it 's unbelievable that my sisters would write this , " he tells wtvc , noting his mom was a " loving , generous woman . " wtvc managed to track down one of his two sisters , and she tells the station she did n't write the obituary , calling it " tragic . " to make matters worse , it appears parts of the obituary may have been plagiarized from one written for someone in california in 2008 . " [ she ] does n't even have the integrity to write something for herself , " miller says , apparently referring to the sister he thinks trashed their mom . the cherokee scout publisher says the paper scans all submitted obituaries but notes they wo n't change anything unless there 's a solid reason . " the family 's will overrode the editor , " he says . miller says he sent in a new obituary to replace the printed one . ( it 's not the first scathing obituary . )
