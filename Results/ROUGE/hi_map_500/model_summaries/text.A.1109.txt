congress ' $ 1.1 trillion spending bill contains a secret provision torpedoing president obama 's plans to pass the drone program from the cia to the pentagon . in a classified annex , the bill specifically prohibits any funds being used to facilitate such a transfer , the washington post reports . obama wants to shift the cia from its paramilitary footing back to an intelligence one , and perhaps bring greater transparency to the drone program . but lawmakers do n't trust the military with the keys . one source said the provision was more complicated than simply withholding money for the switch , and former officials said it could contain language forcing the military to demonstrate its targeting procedures were up to cia standards . intelligence committee chair dianne feinstein last year said she 'd " really have to be convinced " that the military could exercise as much " patience and discretion " as the cia in avoiding civilian casualties , statements she says she stands behind . the military did n't help its case last month either by hitting a wedding party in yemen ; in an op-ed yesterday , yemen 's minister for human rights said that strike had sent a " wave of outrage " across the country . yesterday also saw a drone strike kill a yemeni farmer .
