in a case both bizarre and horrifying , a 19-year-old california woman is burning from the inside out . how that 's possible : an allergic reaction . yaasmeen castanada , a 19-year-old cal state la sophomore and mother to a 4-month-old , was battling a sore throat on thanksgiving , so she took a friend 's antibiotic , reports cnn . she rapidly " started having a hard time breathing , and she told her mom that her lips were burning , her throat , her eyes , they got so red that she could n't talk , " says her aunt . within 24 hours she was hooked up to a ventilator ; she 's now at the university of california , irvine , burn center . her initial diagnosis was known as stevens-johnson syndrome , an allergic reaction that caused her skin 's layers to part , resulting in open wounds . " it can be considered a burn from the inside out , " a dermatologist tells abc7 . but as burn center director dr. victor joe tells cnn , that disease refers to a condition that affects up to a third of the skin ; roughly two-thirds of castanada 's skin is affected , and her condition is now called toxic epidermal necrolysis . though the mortality rate for the diseases can reach as high as 25 % , joe believes she will survive . but he says " we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected . this can cause scarring of the corneas , which could lead to permanent blindness . " per a gofundme page set up by her family , castanada has had surgeries since friday on the top and bottom portions of her body in which skin was scraped to spur new growth . joe calls the case " sobering " and notes that it 's one of about half-a-dozen his unit has seen in the last year . ( last month , a peanut allergy killed a college student . )
