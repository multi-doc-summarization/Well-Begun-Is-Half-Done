it sounds like the stuff of horror films : a creeping black slime that ca n't be killed . but experts say a real-life microbial invasion is coating some of the nation 's most important monuments in black . the national park service earlier this month reported the " biofilm " has befouled the jefferson memorial , particularly its " gleaming white rotunda , " and appears on the washington and lincoln memorials and on tombstones in the congressional cemetery . but the mysterious substance— " part algae , part bacteria , part fungi , " the washington post reports—isn ’ t unique to the washington , dc , area . biofilm has slimed sites around the globe , from egypt to italy to the angkor wat temples in cambodia , per the nps . scientists are only now " starting to understand what it is , and its relationship to stone , " a senior conservator with the nps tells the post . the nps reports it has uncovered a " common factor " related to the establishment of various biofilms : the somewhat vague " presence of nutrients and a place to grow , like stone . " it suspects that in the case of the jefferson memorial , the dimples and holes that have formed in the eroding marble may create an environment ripe for biofilm . that soft marble poses an additional challenge , notes the nps , as any treatment needs to be tested to make sure it wo n't actually inflict harm on the stone . while there 's no known permanent removal method , the nps is evaluating 10 chemicals as potential cleaners and intends to also review options like ozonated water and lasers . the jefferson memorial 's biofilm first became readily visible in 2006 , and there 's currently no timeline for treatment .
