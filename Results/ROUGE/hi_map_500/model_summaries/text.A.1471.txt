" we are very sorry that it took this long , " a condor spokesperson says . flightright says airlines will sometimes drag their feet when paying out compensation in the hopes travelers will give up , but this was probably an honest mistake . " the claim probably just got lost on somebody 's desk , " a flightright spokesperson says . the regulations behind this " ultimate revenge " exacted by the customer require that passengers be compensated when flights are three hours late or more , notes news.com.au . protections for travelers are n't as strong in the us , so do n't expect this to happen here , adds a post at conde nast traveler , " but we still love the visual of a woman towing a jumbo jet home with her behind her car or spray-painting 'property of disgruntled customer ' on the side . " ( this woman sued an airline after being told to switch seats for a man . )
