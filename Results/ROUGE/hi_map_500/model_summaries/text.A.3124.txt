a half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet , in a lake that hasn ’ t been touched by sunshine or wind in millions of years , life goes on . a large us expedition called wissard , led by a professor at montana state university , has unearthed a thriving ecosystem of micro-organisms after drilling through the thick ice to reach subglacial lake whillans in january of 2013 , according to a university news release . considered one of the planet 's final frontiers , the subglacial environments below antarctic ice sheets have long been suspected to harbor life of some kind . many of the micro-organisms found are single-celled organisms , called archaea , that survive by converting ammonium and methane into energy in a harsh environment similar to those found elsewhere in our solar system , such as on jupiter ’ s moon europa . that has led scientists to wonder whether primitive ( but hearty ) life thrives there as well , forbes reports . " it 's the first definitive evidence that there ’ s not only life , but active ecosystems underneath the antarctic ice sheet , something that we have been guessing about for decades , " the lead author says . " with this paper , we pound the table and say , 'yes , we were right . ' " the findings appear today in the journal nature . ( a group of european scientists is already prepping for a mission to search for life on jupiter 's icy moons . )
