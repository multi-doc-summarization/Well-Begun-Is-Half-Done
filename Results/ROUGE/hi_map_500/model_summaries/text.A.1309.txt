jon krakauer takes to the pages of the new yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on everest ( the author was , of course , part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed ) . his piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain 's peak , but before arriving at that point , he shares a fascinating backstory : that of himex , a new zealand-based company that krakauer calls the most " lucrative commercial guiding operation " on everestâ€”one that on may 7 , 2012 , packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home , taking its guides , members ( aka paying climbers , who did n't see their $ 60,000 refunded ) , and sherpas with them . the much-assailed decision was one made by owner russell brice , who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain 's nepal side , an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route . as krakauer writes , the " wedge of ice the size of a beverly hills mansion " that broke free and caused last week 's avalanche came from " that same ice bulge " and killed 16 sherpas . as for the outsize dangers sherpas face , some standout points : between 1921 and 1996 , the mountain 's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents . between 1997 and present , the death ratio was one for every 60 . among the reasons it 's gotten safer : climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen , and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet , which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema . sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter ( and are , of course , the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain ) . krakauer points to an outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of sherpas : us soldiers stationed in iraq between 2003 and 2007 , miners , and commercial fishermen .
