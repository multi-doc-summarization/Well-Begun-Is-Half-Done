tesla is facing more scrutiny following three car fires in six weeks . first , investors launched a lawsuit ; now , the government is getting involved , usa today reports . the national highway traffic safety administration is now investigating two of the fires , both of which occurred after model s undercarriages hit debris on the road ( the other happened during a crash ) . in a blog post , ceo elon musk says his company asked for the investigation and writes that " if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety , we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars . " but the nhtsa tells the lat a different story : " the agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation , which is standard agency practice for all investigations . " musk also says the company will increase the cars ' ground clearance to help prevent them from hitting debris , and warranties will start covering fire damage , even in the event of driver error , " to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars . " to that end : " we believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the model s , " musk notes . " since the model s went into production mid last year , there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the united states alone , resulting in over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries ... compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to tesla fires . the media coverage of model s fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude , despite the latter actually being far more deadly .
