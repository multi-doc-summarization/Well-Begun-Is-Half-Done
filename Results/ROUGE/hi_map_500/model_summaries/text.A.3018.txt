there is a gaggle of americans currently seeking the 2016 presidential nomination , and a fair number of them are using today to talk about donald trump . lindsey graham led the charge , calling trump out on his anti-latino rhetoric and labeling the mogul " a wrecking ball " that could take apart the gop as it seeks to bring hispanic voters into the fold in what graham terms " a defining moment " for the party , reports the hill . " if we do n't reject this way of thinking—clearly , without any ambiguity—we 'll have lost our way , [ and ] we 'll have lost the moral authority , in my view , to govern this great nation . " calling trump 's comments " offensive , " graham said , " i 'm not going to be part of that . " carly fiorina was considerably more amenable , saying that trump was " tapping into an anger i hear everyday ... that a commonsense thing like securing the border or ending sanctuary cities is somehow considered extreme . " democrat jim webb , meanwhile , told fox news , via the hill , that trump should n't " be throwing these bombs " and that such " divisive , inflammatory rhetoric from people who want to be commander in chief is " less than helpful . ( trump , meanwhile , is showing no signs of letting up . )
