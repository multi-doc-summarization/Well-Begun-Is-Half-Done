" we got [ the prince ] before it got too serious , but he would n't have come back in " without malcolm , another of the lifeguard 's supervisors tells 7 news . prince frederik , who had been swimming nearby with princess mary and christian 's three siblings , personally thanked malcolm , a native new zealander , the times notes . but malcolm did n't realize at first who was doing the thanking .
