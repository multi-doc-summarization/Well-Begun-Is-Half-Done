a decades-old murder mystery has finally come to some sort of an end . following a judge 's wednesday ruling , a death certificate has been issued for lord lucan , who the new york times recounts as " a dashing british aristocrat " last seen on nov. 7 , 1974—the day that his children 's nanny was found dead , allegedly by his hand . the bbc recalls the crime : sandra rivett was beaten to death in the family 's london home and her body left in the basement ; lord lucan 's estranged wife was also attacked but got away , fleeing to a neighboring pub and yelling " he ’ s in the house ! he ’ s murdered the nanny ! " per the times . lady lucan named her then 39-year-old husband as the attacker , saying he had thought she was rivett , reports usa today . a june 1975 inquest named him as rivett 's murderer , except the man born richard john bingham was never officially seen again after that night ; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found , blood-stained and abandoned . the sightings and theories kept flowing , though : in melbourne , australia , and france within the first year ; employed as a waiter in san francisco ; backpacking on mount etna ; dying in goa in 1996 . just last saturday came a story from an old gambling friend , who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger . lucan was declared dead in 1996 , but the rub was that son george bingham was unable to take on his title , preventing him from assuming his father 's seat in the house of lords . the death certificate now allows for that .
