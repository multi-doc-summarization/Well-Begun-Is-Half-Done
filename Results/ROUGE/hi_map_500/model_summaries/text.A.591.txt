" i put my hand on her stomach , because i ’ d never felt him kick , " rocha says in a new abc documentary about her daughter 's murder , per people . " she leaned over to me and she said , 'mom , ' she said 'scott doesn ’ t like to do this . ' she said , ' i ’ ve asked him about , you know , feel my stomach when the baby kicks , and he never wants to touch my stomach . ' that really , really bothered me . and that was the last time i saw her . " peterson , eight months pregnant , disappeared soon after on christmas eve in 2002 ; her body and that of the son she was carrying washed ashore in california four months later and her husband , scott , was eventually convicted of her murder ; he is still fighting his guilty verdict and death sentence . in the documentary , which debuts sept. 14 , rocha says the realization that scott may have had something to do with her daughter 's disappearance was a difficult one to accept . " it ’ s not like this is a total stranger that you might be suspecting , " she says . " this is somebody that ’ s been a member of your family for several years now , and it ’ s really , you know , the back and forth and the guilt about feeling this way , and how it may have an effect on the relationship with my daughter if i ’ m wrong . " she adds that scott had been a member of the family she " loved and cared about , " and that knowing how laci felt about him made her not want to consider him a suspect . a & e is also currently airing a series on laci peterson 's murder ; people reported last week that in that series scott peterson was recently heard describing the " terrible physical reaction " he claimed to have upon finding out his wife and son were dead .
