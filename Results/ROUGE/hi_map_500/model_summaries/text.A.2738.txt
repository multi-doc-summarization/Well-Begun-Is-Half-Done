here 's something else not to like about lice , mosquitoes , and fleas . an insecticide used to kill them—pyrethroids—might be linked to behavior issues in children as young as 6 , a french study suggests . the researchers , noting the effects the chemical had on the nervous systems of insects , wondered how it affected humans , notably children . they tested the urine of about 300 pregnant women and , six years later , their children , according to the study published in occupational & environmental medicine . children with the highest levels of pyrethroids in their urine were three times more likely to have behavioral problems than kids with lower levels . the problems might be external ( kids being defiant or disruptive ) or internal ( a reluctance to ask for help ) depending on the specific type of pyrethroid they were exposed to , the study said . " the pesticide class studied are considered 'safe ' pesticides and this study is cause for concern as to how safe it really is , " says a child psychatrist at lenox hill hospital in new york city who reviewed the findings , per healthday news . but he cautions that the study finds only a correlation , not cause and effect . along those lines , a doctor at johns hopkins characterizes the study as preliminary and says it should be followed up by further research , reports yahoo . still , a pediatric behaviorialist not involved with the research recommended that pregnant women use " common sense " when using insecticides and look for products that do n't contain pyrethroids . ( in an awful story out of massachusetts , police say a homemade lice remedy proved fatal for a girl . )
