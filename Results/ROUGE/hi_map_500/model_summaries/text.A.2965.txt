a uk woman got a pretty unexpected christmas card this holiday season—a response to a 23-year-old message in a bottle she 'd dropped in the north sea as a child . while on a ferry from england to belgium in 1990 , zoe lemon—now zoe averianov—wrote a note explaining , " dear finder , my name is zoe lemon . please would you write to me , i would like it a lot . " she added , " i am 10 years old and i like ballet , playing the flute and the piano . i have a hamster called sparkle and fish called speckle , " and dropped it from the boat in a plastic bottle , the bbc reports . fast forward to today , and averianov , 33 , says she 's surprised just how far the message traveled—more than 350 miles . " my parents came to visit on christmas day and they had this letter from europe addressed to my maiden name , " she says . it turns out , the note washed ashore in the netherlands , where piet and jacqueline lateur found it , then returned it with a message of their own . " i know you are no longer a little girl but you asked me to write you so i have , " the response read in part , per the mirror . piet and averianov have kept up the communication , though this time , email is their method of choice . ( but her note just is n't quite as old as what may be the oldest message found in a bottle . )
