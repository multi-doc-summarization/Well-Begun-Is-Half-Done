president trump says he turned down an interview and photo shoot for time magazine 's " person of the year " issue , the ap reports . in a friday evening tweet , trump says the magazine informed him he was " probably " going to be granted the title for the second year in a row but that it would require " an interview and a major photo shoot . " he tweets : " i said probably is no good and took a pass . " the magazine , however , is now disputing trump 's version of events . " the president is incorrect about how we choose person of the year , " said a magazine tweet . time " does not comment on our choice until publication . " as npr notes , the selection is n't necessarily a positive honor ; rather , it 's more a reflection of a person 's influence . trump seems to revel in the magazine 's recognition : earlier this year , it was revealed that several of his private golf clubs were displaying fake time covers featuring his image . this year , the new person of the year will be announced on dec. 6 .
