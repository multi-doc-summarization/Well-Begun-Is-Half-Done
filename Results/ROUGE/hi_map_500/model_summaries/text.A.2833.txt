the bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming : a new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to " adhd-like behavioral problems " in children , cnn reports . the danish study looked at data from more than 64,000 children and found that those who had prenatal exposure to acetaminophen had a 13 % higher risk of exhibiting adhd-like behaviors , a 29 % higher risk of being prescribed adhd medication , and a 37 % higher risk of receiving a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder , a severe form of adhd , usa today reports . the risk increased the later in pregnancy the drug was taken and the longer it was taken . women who used acetaminophen for 20 weeks or longer had a 50 % higher chance of their children being prescribed adhd medication . but the authors did not find a cause-and-effect relationship , and they note that " exhibiting adhd-like behaviors " is not the same as actually having adhd . right now , doctors consider acetaminophen the " safest " pain reliever for pregnant women , nbc news reports ; the study author says pregnant women " should n't worry at this point . " what could account for the link ? the authors think acetaminophen may interfere with key maternal hormones that impact fetal brain development . another recent study also found that frequent acetaminophen use during pregnancy was linked with a 70 % higher risk of behavioral problems in children .
