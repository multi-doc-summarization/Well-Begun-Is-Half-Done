george zimmerman now has a legal site , a defense-minded twitter feed , and a 7-year-old myspace page that 's causing some fresh trouble . the miami herald unearthed the page , which has been confirmed as authentic by his lawyer , and reports on the less seemly details contained within . most notably : not-so-nice comments about mexicans . sample lines : " i dont miss driving around scared to hit mexicans walkin on the side of the street , soft ass wan na be thugs messin with peoples cars when they aint around ( what are you provin , that you can dent a car when no ones watchin ) . " " workin 96 hours to get a decent pay check , gettin knifes pulled on you by every mexican you run into ! " the page , which was abandoned in 2005 , also talks about zimmerman 's " ex-hoe , " references jailed friends , brags about getting two felonies reduced to misdemeanors , and mentions that he misses his friends in his hometown of manassas , va . the herald notes that he also posted several photos , including one in which he appears to be wearing the infamous orange polo from his 2005 mugshot .
