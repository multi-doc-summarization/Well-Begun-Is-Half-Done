in our own obituary of ak-47 inventor mikhail kalashnikov last month , we included this quote : the rifle was invented " for the protection of the motherland , " he said . " i have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it . " it turns out " no regrets " might not have exactly been true . the afp picks up a report from russia 's izvestia that kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the russian orthodox church nine months before his december death in which he wrote of " unbearable ... spiritual pain " and asked about his culpability . it contains this line : " i keep having the same unsolved question : if my rifle took away people 's lives , then can it be that i ... am guilty for people 's deaths , even if they were enemies ? " afp notes that izvestia ran a copy of the letter , which is typed on kalashnikov 's personal stationery and signed " with a wavering hand . " a rep for patriarch kirill confirms that the letter was sent , and says the church leader wrote a replyâ€”one that very may well have calmed his fears . says the rep , " the church has a very definite position : when weapons serve to protect the fatherland , the church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it . " but the bbc notes that it 's not clear whether every word came from kalashnikov : izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter .
