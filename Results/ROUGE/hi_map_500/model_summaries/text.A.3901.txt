in what the washington post calls an " extraordinary breach of political decorum , " donald trump is n't endorsing paul ryan in his wisconsin primary battle . trump tells the post he 's " not quite there yet " when it comes to backing ryan . trump may be getting his revenge on ryan , who last spring said he was " not there right now " about endorsing trump before finally giving in . it 's also possible trump 's decision not to endorse ryan has to do with ryan not supporting trump 's continued attacks on the khans . meanwhile , ryan 's primary opponent , paul nehlen , defended trump 's comments this week , saying the khans " attacked , ridiculed , and attempted to humiliate trump , " according to npr . trump then publicly complimented nehlen 's " very good campaign . " “ i like paul , but these are horrible times for our country , ” trump tells the post . “ we need very strong leadership . " trump claims ryan sought his endorsement , a claim denied by a ryan spokesperson . regardless , ryan is expected to easily defeat nehlen , politico reports . trump also refused to endorse john mccain in his primary campaign , claiming mccain has n't done right by the country 's veterans . in the same post interview , trump called out new hampshire republican sen. kelly ayotte . it should be noted that both ayotte and mccain denounced trump 's attacks on the khans . ayotte says she still plans to vote for trump .
