chris kluwe made a name for himself not only as an nfl punter but as a ( very ) outspoken advocate for gay marriage . now kluwe has taken to deadspin to allege that he got cut from the minnesota vikings after eight years by special teams coach mike priefer , " a bigot who did n't agree with the cause i was working for , " because of his views . he also calls out " two cowards , " ( recently fired ) head coach leslie frazier and team gm rick spielman for not standing up to priefer . in the lengthy account , kluwe recounts his controversial 2012 season and subsequent firing . " if there 's one thing i hope to achieve from sharing this story , it 's to make sure that mike priefer never holds a coaching position again in the nfl , and ideally never coaches at any level , " writes kluwe , who quotes the coach at one point as suggesting that all gay people be rounded up on an island and nuked . " it 's inexcusable that someone would use his status as a teacher and a role model to proselytize on behalf of his own doctrine of intolerance , and i hope he never gets another opportunity to pass his example along to anyone else . " the team responded this afternoon by saying it would " thoroughly review this matter , " reports the minneapolis star tribune , but it insisted that kluwe got fired for football performance , not his views on marriage equality . click to read kluwe 's full post .
