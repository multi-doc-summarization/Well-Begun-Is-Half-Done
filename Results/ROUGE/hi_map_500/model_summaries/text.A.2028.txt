with protests gaining steam , the city of north charleston is trying to stay aggressive in its reaction to a white police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed black man : officer michael slager , who already has been charged with murder , has been fired from the force , the mayor said today . mayor keith summey also announced that every police officer in the city will wear body cameras from now on , reports the post and courier . " i have watched the video and was sickened by what i saw , " said police chief eddie diggers of footage of the shooting taken by a bystander . as he spoke at a press conference , the ap reports that protesters interrupted him with chants of " no justice , no peace . " " it looked like he was trying to kill a deer or something , running through the woods , " walter scott sr. , father of the slain walter scott , tells nbc . though slager has been fired , the city will continue to pay his health insurance for a while because his wife is eight months ' pregnant . meanwhile , the daily beast reports that the attorney who initially represented slager dropped him as a client as soon as video emerged of the shootingâ€”but he 's leaving it for others to connect the dots . " i ca n't specifically state what is the reason why or what is n't the reason why i 'm no longer his lawyer , " says david aylor . " all i can say is that the same day of the discovery of the video that was disclosed publicly , i withdrew as counsel immediately . "
