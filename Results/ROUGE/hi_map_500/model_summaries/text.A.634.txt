anthony weiner has an unfortunate new title to go with " disgraced congressman . " from now on , he 'll also be a registered sex offender . weiner appeared in federal court on friday and pleaded guilty to a charge of transmitting sexual material to a minor , reports the new york daily news . " i have a sickness , but i do not have an excuse , " weiner said in confessing to sending sexual images to a 15-year-old girl in north carolina . while reading his statement , he " quickly dissolved into tears , " reports the new york times . and he might yet end up in jail . related coverage : divorce : the new york post reports that huma abedin also filed for divorce from weiner on friday . it 's uncontested , suggesting no fight is expected over assets or custody of their son . what he said : cbs news has the full text of his court statement here . prison : weiner faces up to 10 years when he is sentenced in september , but do n't bet on it . prosecutors said 21 to 27 months would be " fair and appropriate , " and the ap notes that weiner agreed not to appeal any sentence of that length . he also could be spared jail altogether . keeping track : having trouble remembering all the weiner scandals ? this timeline of his career from the ap might help . affecting an election : if hillary clinton blames james comey for her loss , then she should be blaming weiner , too . cnn lays out how his sexting got tangled up in her email trouble . how sad : amber phillips assesses it all at the washington post , including the question of why on earth weiner and abedin allowed a documentary to be made about them . the " sad " weiner story is not just " one of the weirdest political stories of the social media age , " she writes . it 's " guffaw-worthy . cynical . just plain puzzling . gross . criminal . and somehow totally impactful . " moving on : at cnn , chris cillizza makes a plea likely to have plenty of support : " now , can we please agree to just stop talking about weiner ? "
