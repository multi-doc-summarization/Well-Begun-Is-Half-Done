the iconic emperor penguin is now marching toward its own demise thanks to climate change , according to the first study to assess the creature 's long-term chances . an international team of scientists studying antarctica 's emperor penguin population is calling for the birds to be reclassified as " endangered " after finding that , if sea ice continues to melt at its current rate , all of the continent 's penguin populations will be in decline by 2100 , with the total population down 19 % from today 's numbers ; the researchers project two-thirds of the 45 known colonies will drop to less than half their current size . they 're calling for the establishment of marine reserves to help protect the penguins . writing in the journal nature climate change , the researchers say there will at first be an increase in the current total of 600,000 penguins due to a recent increase in sea ice , phys.org reportsâ€”algae grows under the ice , which sustains the krill that the penguins eat . but one expert explains that too much ice elongates the females ' march to the sea to obtain food ; not enough ice , and waves could fracture colonies come spring . most of the planet 's 18 types of penguins are dropping in population size , reports reuters , with only king , adelie , and chinstrap thought to be increasing . ( climate change is taking its toll on penguins in argentina , too . )
