while investigating samples of toxic levels of heavy metals found in sperm whales , researchers stumbled upon a surprising discovery : all of today 's sperm whales appear to have descended from the same female , reports hakai magazine . they 've named her eve and say she lived between 10,000 and 80,000 years ago . in the journal molecular ecology , the researchers explain that the genetic diversity of the whales , one of the planet 's largest animals , turns out to be even lower than previously thought . the key was locked away in the species ' mitochondrial dna , a type of dna passed down through the generations from mothers , not fathers . conducting genetic tests on 542 samples collected over the past six years by ocean alliance and comparing them to another 1,000 whales analyzed in the past 15 years , they found that a single female whale left her thumbprint on all of them . which does n't quite make sense given that mothers tend to dominate certain areas without moving around , so the spread of one set of genes across the globe would be unusual . somewhere along the line one mother whale and her descendants were able to out-compete all other females alive at the time—perhaps there was a sudden global population decline , or female whale behavior was dramatically different then—and their genetic lineage took off . one drawback is that this lack of diversity makes the whales more susceptible to things such as climate change , notes smithsonian , suggesting that " today ’ s moms will need to get out more for the sake of their species .
