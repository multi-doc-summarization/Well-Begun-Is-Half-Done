john boehner could only laugh when he heard republicans talking about quickly repealing and replacing the affordable care act . “ republicans never ever agree on health care , " politico quotes the former house speaker as saying thursday . despite president trump saying to expect a plan to repeal and replace obamacare by mid-march , boehner says an aca repeal is only " happy talk " and definitely " not going to happen . " he says republicans will eventually settle on only slight changes to obamacare and that " most of the framework " will remain in place . republican lawmakers are currently being beset at town halls with constituents worried about losing their health insurance . cnbc reports a new poll found an even 45 % split between voters who approve of obamacare and those who oppose it . that 's a 4-point increase for the approve side and a 7-point decrease for the oppose side just since early january . the poll found only 24 % of voters want the aca completely repealed ; 26 % want to see it expanded . republicans in congress are now turning to a handful of republican governors—john kasich and scott walker , among others—to help them figure this mess out , sources tell cnn . lawmakers apparently want the governors to figure out what to do about the millions of people who received coverage with the expansion of medicaid under obamacare .
