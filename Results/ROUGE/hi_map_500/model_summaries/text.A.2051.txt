with an official count of 7,041,000 signups under obamacare—a number expected to grow as final tallies are made—president obama enjoyed what both abc and nbc called a " victory lap " in the rose garden today . " many of the tall tales have been debunked , " he said . " there are still no death panels . armageddon has not arrived . " the president said he does n't understand why so many were " so mad about the idea of people having health insurance , " but they better get over it , because the law is working " and it 's here to stay . " another person who used the term " victory lap " was john boehner , but he did so in criticizing obama for celebrating a law that " continues to harm the american people , " reports the los angeles times . meanwhile , dave weigel at slate dubs " confused arkansas guy " as the newest obamacare victim . that 's thanks to a new ad funded by the koch brothers ' americans for prosperity group in which a man complains not that his policy has been canceled , but that it 's now surrounded in a confusing " haze " because of the new law . " it was taken away from us , or it was given back to us , or it was taken , " he says . a main target is democratic sen. mark pryor .
