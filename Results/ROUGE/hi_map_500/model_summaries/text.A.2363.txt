samantha anderson figured she had a work-packed weekend ahead when something happened at breakfast : the then-39-year-old could n't swallow a single bite . " i went to swallow and i couldn ’ t , " says the australian jewelry maker . " it didn ’ t happen . i choked . " the mother of three dismissed it until she could n't eat anything that day and went to a doctor , who diagnosed stress and prescribed valium , then anti-depressants , australia 's news network reports . then , after six months of weight loss and ravenous hunger , an answer : dysphagia—an unusual condition that prevents people from swallowing . " my days became solely about survival , " she writes for the swallowing disorder foundation . " i would set goals for myself—a whole tub of yogurt , a glass of water and two whole strawberries to be consumed by the end of the day . i rarely met them . " doctors told her a bout of shingles had damaged cranial nerves v , vii , ix and x , which triggered her swallowing issue . ( mosaic science notes 7 of our dozen cranial nerves have a role in swallowing . ) more than 18 months later , she had a feeding tube inserted ; it provided a welcome relief from the 13 drinks she had been tasked with trying to choke down each day . the brisbane resident and her husband then contacted us expert peter belafsky , whom she credits with understanding and helping her . " it ’ s like being constantly waterboarded , " belafsky says of dysphagia , which can render patients unable to swallow even their own saliva . some 3.5 years after her fateful breakfast , anderson 's diet has expanded to include mashed potatoes , blueberries , oatmeal , and bread . " i am determined to eat , " she writes , " even though it ’ s a long and arduous battle to get through each and every meal . " ( in another case , a teenager 's bleeding eyes are ruining her life . )
