reviews of justin timberlake 's halftime show sunday have generally not been kind , and mikael wood of the los angeles times delivers a particularly devastating line : " this guy has nothing to say and just wo n't stop saying it . " the sentiment applies not just to the halftime show but to timberlake 's new release , man of the woods . about the best that can said of timberlake 's super bowl performance is that " the tightly choreographed production was impressive from a logistics standpoint , " writes wood . beyond that , there was almost nothing to enjoy . " the performance lacked soul , meaning , humor ; it had no message , nor was it taking any stand—soft , hard or otherwise . " at least timberlake did n't go ahead with rumored plans to perform with a hologram of prince . instead , he settled for a lesser version of the late superstar projected on a screen . but even that is inviting unfavorable comparisons to prince 's 2007 show , " which eclipses timberlake 's in every way , " writes maeve mcdermott at usa today . prince actually sang , " while timberlake let his backing tracks and background singers do the heavy lifting . " both reviews cite the kid with whom timberlake took a selfie , though not in a positive light for the singer , because the teen seemed kind of uninterested in timberlake himself . meanwhile , chris willman at variety finds better things to say of the show . " if it was more a feat of athleticism than aestheticism , you can ’ t say that ’ s entirely inappropriate for the occasion . "
