just days after south africa 's rolene strauss won this year 's crown , miss world organizers have announced it will no longer feature the swimsuit portion of the contest , reports the new york daily news . next year 's competition will be the first year in the event 's 63-year history in which the contestants put on a " beachwear " fashion show instead of parading down the catwalk in bikinis , abc news reports . it 's not exactly clear what " beachwear " means , though a rep for the event frames it as " more of a fashion competition than a bikini show . " the daily news notes that miss world had already stopped airing the bathing suit portion of the competition , and had made it optional . donald trump , who owns the miss universe pageant , puts what elle calls a " strong emphasis " on swimsuits and does n't include interviews or service elements during his contest , as miss world does . after miss world chairwoman julia morley 's husband ( the founder of miss world ) died in 2000 , trump called morley and reportedly asked , " so little lady , are you ready to throw in the towel ? " his remarks spurred morley to get a $ 5 million loan and keep her contest going . as for the latest change , " i do n't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis , " morley tells elle . " it does n't do anything for the woman . and it does n't do anything for any of us . " ( miss world got rid of bikinis in 2013 out of respect to host country indonesia . )
