mitt romney has been doing his opponent some serious favors during his trip to london . he 's managed to offend the british public with remarks about olympic preparedness , prompting a witty comeback from david cameron . he let slip that he 'd met with the boss of mi6 . and he called the leader of the opposition labor party " mr. leader , " not the norm in the uk . it 's " almost too embarrassing " to compare candidate obama 's europe trip with romney 's , writes nicholas watt in the guardian . " obama wooed a quarter of a million people in berlin while romney was mocked by the british prime minister , " watt notes . here 's a tip for the candidate : " try not to offend your host , particularly when he is the leader of your closest sister party in a country that is meant to enjoy a 'special relationship ' with the us . " another romney gaffe , picked up by gawker : he said he was looking " out of the backside of 10 downing street , " which sounds even worse in britain than it does in the states .
