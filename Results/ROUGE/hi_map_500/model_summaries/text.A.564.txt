president trump was teasing a " very big announcement " thursday night in west virginia , cnn reports . and while west virginia sen. joe manchin had hoped it would be " good news " about jobs or the opioid crisis , it appears instead that the state 's democratic gov . jim justice will reveal he 's switching parties . according to politico , no one in the democratic party was warned about justice 's plans . “ obviously we 're pissed . i mean let 's face it , we put a lot of effort in the 2015 election to elect this man as governor , ” a democratic operative in west virginia says . democrats had held the governorship in west virginia since 2001 . while democrats were n't given notice of justice 's switch , they probably should n't be surprised . justice only joined the democratic party in 2015 to run for governor . he had been a registered independent and republican prior to that and even donated to the republican governors ' association a few years before his run as a democrat . he 's also friends with the trump family and sen. mitch mcconnell . plus , the ever-more conservative west virginia is a hotbed of trump support . with justice 's defection , there are only 15 democratic governors in the us and only six states in which democrats control the governorship and both legislative chambers , the hill reports . meanwhile , west virginia becomes the 26th state in which republicans control all three .
