the worst outbreak of bird flu in us history is leaving farmers with huge piles of dead chickens and turkeys to get rid ofâ€”and leaving consumers with less money in their pockets . it 's not just cartons of eggs that have gone up in price with the deaths of millions of hens , the new york times reports , but the liquid eggs used in dozens of products like mayonnaise and ice cream . there are now 15 states with confirmed cases of avian flu , and iowa , which supplies a fifth of the country 's eggs , has been especially hard-hit , with more than 40 % of its egg-laying chickens gone , the times reports . it takes time to build new flocks of laying chickens , and analysts warn that prices are expected to keep climbing , especially for liquid eggs . " we 're starting to see some shortages , because for some of the companies that have lost a large number of these birds , there 's no fallback , " an exec at commodity analyst urner barry tells bloomberg . " you ca n't just go and say , 'oh , i need 2 million eggs today , where can i get them ? ' we 're just not able to replace them that easily . " in a worrying sign , a major south dakota farm that had taken extensive precautions confirmed cases of avian flu this week and all of its 1.3 million hens will be euthanized , the ap reports . " as many poultry farms are discovering , even our extraordinary measures proved ineffective in preventing the spread of avian influenza into one of our barns , " dakota layers said in a statement . ( an egg producer in iowa had to kill 5.3 million chickens last month . )
