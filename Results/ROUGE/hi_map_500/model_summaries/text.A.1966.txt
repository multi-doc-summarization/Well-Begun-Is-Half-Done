some apple users are sick of the company 's new ios 7 operating system . literally . the new zoom and slide animations , and the 'floating " icons on the home screen , are causing motion sickness in many people with vestibular disorders—conditions that affect balance and vision , the guardian reports . " i now have to close my eyes or cover the screen during transitions , which is ridiculous , " says one app developer , who reports headaches and other symptoms associed with motion sickness . " tap an app and it 's like flying through the icon and landing in that app 's micro world—and i 'm getting dizzy on the journey there . " other symptoms from exposure to this kind of animation can include " intense nausea , dizziness and vertigo , " says a spokesperson for the vestibular disorders association . one developer affected by motion sickness has already built an app to disable the offending features , reports stuff . but others say apple itself needs to step up . tech writer kirk mcelhearn says apple was once " at the forefront of providing accessibility options , " but now needs to demonstrate more sensitivity to users like him . " their apparent disregard is disturbing , and shows a trend toward paying lip service to accessibility , but not thinking it through , " he writes on his blog kirkville .
