the amtrak train that derailed in washington state monday morning , killing at least three people , was speeding , officials say , and not by a trivial amount : the train was going 80mph in a zone where the limit was 30mph when it came off the tracks on an overpass between tacoma and olympia , spilling cars onto interstate 5 , national transportation safety board member bella dinh-zarr said monday night . she said it was " too early to tell " why the train , which was making its first run on a new route , was going so fast , the ap reports . washington state transportation department spokeswoman barbara laboe says the train was supposed to slow down dramatically as it entered the curve , and speed-limit warnings were posted two miles ahead of the zone as well as just before it , reports the seattle times . amtrak president richard anderson says positive train control , a system that can slow down speeding trains , was not in use on the stretch of track where the accident occurred . more than 70 people were injured in the crash , at least 10 of them seriously , authorities say . it 's not clear yet whether the three people killed were motorists or people from the train , which carried 80 passengers , five crew members , and a technician , the oregonian reports . state police say 19 uninjured people from the train were reunited with their families . president trump tweeted that the accident showed why his infrastructure plan " must be approved quickly , " though the new york times notes that the accident happened on brand new tracks that were part of a state-funded infrastructure investment program .
