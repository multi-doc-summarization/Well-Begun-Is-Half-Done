barack obama may not be mitt-romney-rich ( or even al-gore-rich ) , but he 's doing all right for himself . the president 's latest financial disclosure forms , released yesterday , reveal that he and michelle had total assets worth somewhere between $ 1.8 million and $ 7 million in 2013 , the ap reports . ( that 's just like 2012 . ) most of that is in us treasury notes , which are worth between $ 1 million and $ 5 million . other assets include vanguard retirement funds and college saving funds . current financial disclosure rules only require politicians to list their assets within a broad range , so it 's hard to pin down exactly how much obama has , the new york times explains . besides his presidential salary , obama makes most of his money off royalties from his books , though the market seems to believe he peaked as a writer in the '90s . his latest , 2010 's of thee i sing , a letter to my daughters , earned between $ 5,001 and $ 15,000 , compared to $ 50,001- $ 100,000 for 1995 's dreams from my father . but even of thee 's numbers probably sound good to joe biden , who made less than $ 201 in royalties last year off of his 2007 book promises to keep .
