joy milne noticed a small difference in her husband just before he turned 40 . " his smell changed , " the scottish woman tells the bbc . " it was n't all of a sudden . it was very subtle—a musky smell . " he was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease six years later and died in june at age 65 . milne found herself supporting the parkinson 's uk charity , where she noticed others had the same distinct smell . she happened to mention her observation to scientists at a talk , and they later put her to the test , presenting her with t-shirts worn by six people with parkinson 's and six without . " she got the six parkinson 's , but then she was adamant one of the 'control ' subjects had parkinson 's , " says a scientist . researchers were impressed and dubbed her a " super-smeller , " per afp . then eight months later , that one control subject returned to tell scientists he had just been diagnosed with parkinson 's . because of milne 's sniffer , scientists now theorize that changes in the sebum—an oily substance produced by the skin—may occur in people with early parkinson 's . now parkinson 's uk is funding a study that will see swabs taken from 200 people with and without parkinson 's and studied by a team of smell experts , including milne . the swabs will also be studied chemically . a proven link between an odor and the disease could make for an easy and clear way to identify a disease that is " incredibly difficult ... to diagnose , " as the scotland director of parkinson 's uk puts it . " it would be absolutely incredible and life-changing . " currently , doctors diagnose the disease largely as they have for the last two centuries : by observing a patient and his or her symptoms . ( the human nose really is amazing . )
