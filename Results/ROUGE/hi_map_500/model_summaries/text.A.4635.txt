the mother of an 11-month-old baby in australia can once again breastfeed her child , but it took the intervention of a court . sydney 's family court today overturned a previous decision barring the woman from breastfeeding because she had gotten a tattoo a month ago , reports 9 news . the earlier judge thought that put the child at risk for diseases such as hiv or hepatitis and ordered the unidentified woman to stop breastfeeding , but a family court judge ridiculed the decision as one that seems to have resulted purely from " surfing the internet . " the unusual case stems from a nasty custody dispute , explains the australian broadcasting corporation . the child 's parent 's are n't together , and the father complained to the court that the mother was unfit , in part because of the tattoo . the woman tested negative for any diseases , but the first judge deemed the results inconclusive . " it is the view of the court that it is not in the best interests of the child that the mother continue to breastfeed , " he ruled , per the sydney morning herald . the strange thing is that he cited guidelines from the australian breastfeeding association , but the leader of that group thinks he overreacted . " women do need to be careful , " she says . " but it does n't mean that you have to wrap yourself in glad wrap . " ( dad can take heart : he lost , but his kid may end up earning more in the long run . )
