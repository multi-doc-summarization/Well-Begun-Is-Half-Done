" lagerfield said he 's used faber-castell pencils since he was a kid and began sketching his own designs . " i wanted to become an illustrator , so i studied every book of costume design from any kind of period , " says the chanel impresario , per quartz . he tested out his skills for the 2014 coco chanel the allure of chanel . ( what offends lagerfeld 's design sensibilities ? lots of things . )
