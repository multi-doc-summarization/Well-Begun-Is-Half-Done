" some viewers may consider it cruel to ask a criminal to do an interview when they are about to be executed . on the contrary , they want to be heard , " she said . " some criminals i interviewed told me : ' i 'm really very glad . i said so many things in my heart to you at this time . in prison , there was never a person i was willing to talk to about past events .
