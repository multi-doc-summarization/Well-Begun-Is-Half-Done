in a move that 's being called " outrageous " and " luxury on steroids , " ford has debuted a new pickup truck ... that costs $ 94,445 . to be fair , you do n't have to spend nearly $ 100,000 to get your hands on a 2018 f-450 super duty limited truck , but should you " check every option box , " as ford puts it in a press release , that is how much you 'll spend . starting prices for the trucks in the f-series super duty line , which debuted thursday at the state fair of texas and also includes an f-250 and an f-350 , range from $ 80,835 to $ 87,100 . so what do you get for that amount of money ? well , the f-450 can tow trailers weighing upwards of 30,000 pounds ( cnet calls it " a luxury condo that can tow a jet " ) ; standard features on the line include 360-degree camera coverage , a panoramic moon roof , heated and ventilated seats , and a leather-trimmed heated steering wheel , among other things , usa today reports . " i know it â€™ s tempting for us to laugh at a solid-axled , body-on-frame pickup that pushes six-figures , but there are rich folks out there who make a living by doing honest , hard work , " writes david tracy at jalopnik . " and if they want to treat themselves with a bit of supple leather rubbing against their butt-cheeks , who are we to judge ? "
