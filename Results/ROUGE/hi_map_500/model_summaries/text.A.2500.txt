" in a financial release , ford said that it plans to transition to just two cars over the next few years : the ford mustang and the new ford active , a " crossover " vehicle to be released next year . ford currently sells the fiesta , focus , fusion , c-max , mustang , and taurus sedans and coupes in north america reports techcrunch , which notes that the lincoln sedans are also expected to vanish . ford has n't said exactly when the taurus and other models will be phased out , but the company 's statement says almost 90 % of its north america portfolio will be trucks , utilities , and commercial vehicles by 2020 . auto industry experts say the move is a bold one , but not totally unexpected , given the continuing shift among consumers away from cars and toward suvs. " ford ’ s announcement to pretty much get out of the car business ... comes as no surprise , " says analyst michelle krebs , per the detroit free press . " ford ’ s car sales have been dismal for the past couple of years , and there ’ s no end in sight to the decline of traditional cars . "
