this exhibit is n't likely to get much a-list approval : florida 's cory allen contemporary art showroom plans to include some of the recent hacked nude photos of celebrities as part of an art show titled " no delete . " the st. petersburg gallery tells fox news that the october show is " about invasion of privacy " and " has been in the works for about two years now . " after photos of jennifer lawrence , kate upton , and others leaked , los angeles artist xvala decided to add them to his work , the gallery explains . e ! reports the collection also will include intimate and nude images of celebrities taken from google over a seven-year period , printed " life-size and unaltered . " " in today 's culture , everybody wants to know everything about everybody , " says xvala in a statement . " an individual 's privacy has become everyone else 's business . " the gallery is using a this-is-art rationale to defend the piece and say it 's within the law , but mtv sounds skeptical it will happen considering that the photos are now part of an fbi investigation and celebs are promising to prosecute those who share them . it also notes that xvala 's decision to show the exhibit in florida rather than his native state " might have something to do with the fact that in california , posting nude photos without consent and with the intention of causing distress is actually against the law .
