the senate voted to begin debate on a bill based on barack obama ’ s tax cut deal last night , with the final vote expected to be held monday . the senate ’ s version of the bill will add $ 858 billion to the deficit over 10 years , the wall street journal reports . though the bill largely follows the white house outline , lawmakers tacked on an extension of subsidies for ethanol and alternative energy sources to sweeten the deal for democrats . the previously-reticent harry reid is now behind the bill , and predicts it 'll pass with nearly all republicans and many democrats supporting it . the house , on the other hand , is in open revolt ; yesterday , in a closed-door session , democrats were actually chanting “ just say no , ” as they voted against bringing the proposal to the floor . " if it 's 'take it or leave it , ' we 'll leave it , " one democrat told the ap . but a reid spokesman had this to say about the house : “ this vote demonstrates they may be irrelevant to this process .
