those who complain baseball is too slow may be heartened to hear a quicker pace is on its way . based on a tuesday evening tweet from espn 's howard bryant , sports illustrated reports that , starting with the 2017 season , mlb pitchers will no longer have to waste time lobbing four pitches at batters they plan to intentionally walk . instead , teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works , and the runner can immediately saunter over to first . this change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game , per estimates by the wall street journal . the washington post notes " not everyone is thrilled " with the change , including those who enjoy watching what happens when intentional-walk pitches go wild or batters go for them anyway . others wonder if the time savings is worth the effort , with one commenter noting : " is the automatic ibb really gon na fix pace of play ? " ( start reading about baseball 's " most interesting pitcher " with all that time you just gained . )
