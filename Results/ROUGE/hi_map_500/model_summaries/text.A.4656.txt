melania trump is holed up in new york city until at least the end of son barron 's school year , already redefining the role of first lady . the new york times reports on that upended role , and whether melania will even play much of one at all , noting it was trump 's daughter ivanka , not his wife , who accompanied him to dover air force base to honor a us navy seal killed during last weekend 's yemen raid . a first-lady historian tells the times that melania is " far behind the curve " in terms of conventional duties , including organizing the tour requests that are already stacking up . people said to be close to mrs. trump , though , say she 'll eventually increase her presence but is in no rush to do so . other ruminations about the first lady from around the web : afp expands on the " low-profile " first lady , with a connecticut college professor observing that the first lady 's agenda has traditionally emerged in march or april of inauguration years . melania has made one major move : she hired lindsay reynolds , a private fundraising organizer , as her chief of staff , per politico , which calls the first lady 's office the " loneliest place in the white house . " despite an us weekly report earlier this week that melania and 10-year-old barron may never leave new york , an aide to the first lady tells abc news that melania ( and presumably barron ) will indeed relocate to dc at the beginning of the summer . the rep adds mrs. trump takes " the role and responsibilities of the first lady very seriously . " melania 's defamation lawsuit against the daily mail was tossed by a maryland judge because the state court did not have jurisdiction to take on a foreign entity , buzzfeed reports . her suit against a blogger continues .
