brooklyn nine-nine star terry crews has a lot to be thankful for now that his show has been rescued by nbc after fox nixed the beloved series last week . crews seemed especially grateful to several actors who voiced their support for the show along with its many fans . on saturday , he name-checked some fellow celebrities to thank them for amplifying the show 's cause , including star wars actor mark hamill . " i want to personally thank you mark for using the power of the force to save brooklyn nine nine ! *wipes dirt off shoulder* , " crews tweeted . per the hollywood reporter , crews also gave shout-outs to actor sean astin and broadway star lin-manuel miranda . by sunday , however , it began to seem like crews ' gratitude may have been misdirected . while the fan outcry was heartening , nbc entertainment chairman robert greenblatt told the ap that because of business considerations , the pickup already was in the works . the show is made by a studio owned by nbc universal . greenblatt said if he had known earlier in the series ' development that andy samberg was going to star in brooklyn nine-nine , nbc 's studio never would have sold it to fox in the first place . " it was a missed opportunity for us from the beginning , " he said . " we jumped on it really quickly , and we 're thrilled to have it . "
