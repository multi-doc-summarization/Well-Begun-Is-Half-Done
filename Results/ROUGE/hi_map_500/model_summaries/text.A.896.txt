despite once expressing a desire to punch him , robert de niro now says he 's open to working president trump—at least indirectly—on exploring the debunked link between autism and vaccines , the washington post reports . " if he does the right thing , he does the right thing , " the actor said following a panel wednesday at the national press club . the panel was led by robert kennedy jr. , chairman of the world mercury project . according to buzzfeed news , kennedy believes journalists are working with the cdc to bury the truth about a vaccine ingredient called thimerosal causing autism in children , and he offered a $ 100,000 reward to anyone who can produce a study that finds vaccines with the ingredient are safe for kids and pregnant women . de niro , who was mostly quiet during the panel , did speak up to say he agrees with kennedy " 100 % . " science , on the other hand , does not . doctors , medical organizations , and the cdc say kennedy 's beliefs are unequivocally false . the director of a vaccine education center says seven studies published between 2000 and 2007 alone show that . furthermore , thimerosal has n't been used in children 's vaccines since 1999 and is barely used in flu vaccines anymore , but autism rates are rising anyway , notes buzzfeed . kennedy met with trump in january about heading a commission on vaccine safety . he says he 's spoken to aides three times about the commission since then and expects it to happen , stat reports . with that on the horizon , 350 medical organizations , including the american academy of pediatrics , sent a letter to trump last week reasserting the safety of vaccines .
