darrell issa is upping his attack on president obama following the president 's use of executive privilege in an attempt to bail out eric holder . a letter to obama released today minces no words : " either you or your most senior advisors were involved in managing operation fast & furious and the fallout from it , " it reads , " or , you are asserting a presidential power that you know to be unjustified solely for the purpose of further obstructing a congressional investigation . " the white house has continued to insist it has not been working with the doj during the congressional investigation into the failed atf gun-walking operation , but issa says obama 's use of executive privilege raises doubts about that assertion . politico notes that the letter probably wo n't force obama to do anything , but will definitely get attention . this week is a particularly tense one for the white house : it 's very possible the house 's decision on whether to hold holder in contempt will come on the same day as the supreme court decision on obamacare . meanwhile , democrats are looking to spin the contempt motion—as an assault on minority rights that could possibly suppress voters , seeing as the doj is currently fighting against voter id laws . al sharpton and a number of other civil rights leaders will hold a press conference on the issue today . " i ’ m not saying that this is because holder is black , and i ’ m not calling [ republicans ] racists , " sharpton tells the hill . " i ’ m saying what they ’ re doing has a racial effect , and that ’ s what we ’ re going to talk about . "
