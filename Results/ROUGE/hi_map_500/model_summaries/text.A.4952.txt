bristol palin got the boot from dancing with the stars : all-stars last night—even though she and partner mark ballas actually did not get the lowest score of the week , for the first time in the entire competition . that slot went to kirstie alley and partner maks chmerkovskiy , the hufington post reports , but the audience still voted palin out . " i had an awesome time and an awesome partner and i wish everyone the best of luck , " palin said before leaving the stage—but once backstage , she refused to talk to press , which was a little odd , e ! notes . ballas explained that she was " preparing for the schedule that lays ahead , " which may have meant their appearance on jimmy kimmel live ( in which palin asked kimmel to apologize for all his jokes about her mother ) . ballas also said he was " really proud " of his partner . " for someone like that with zero entertainment experience , she did n't go down without a fight , " he said , adding that she was " more vocal about what she wants " since her first appearance on the show . one thing she did n't want : matching bunny costumes for this week 's dance , people reports . ballas gave up on the costume idea , but after the elimination he bemoaned bristol not being more " open-minded " and willing to step " out of the box .
