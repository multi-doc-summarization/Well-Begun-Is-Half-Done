the tale of the demise of easter island 's people may have to be rewritten . the story has long held that infighting as resources ran out was one of the main drivers of the collapse , but a new study published in the journal of pacific archaeology suggests a different scenario . cnn reports on the " unlikely method " of examining the society via of some of the stone tools used to carve the island 's famous stone figures : researchers performed a chemical analysis on four of the statues and fragments from 17 of the roughly 1,600 basalt tools , called toki , that had been excavated . the goal was to determine where the basalt had come from . there were three quarries on the island that were potential sources of the volcanic rock ; the key discovery is that there was " near exclusive " use of a single quarry to make the toki . here 's the jump researchers are making from there , per a press release : lead study author dale simpson jr. sees that as " solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups . ... the idea of competition and collapse on easter island might be overstated . " but jo anne van tilburg , who led the excavations , cautions against coming to an overstated conclusion in this case . she says the findings bolster the view " of craft specialization based on information exchange , but we ca n't know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative . it may also have been coercive in some way . human behavior is complex . " ( this separate study pushes the same theory but based on different evidence : obsidian . )
