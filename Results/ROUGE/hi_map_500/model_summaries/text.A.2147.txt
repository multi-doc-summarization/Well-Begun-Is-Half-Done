america can once again boast that it is home to the world 's fastest supercomputer . ibm 's sequoia system knocked japan 's k computer into second place after clocking in at a staggering 16.32 " petaflops " —that 's 16 quadrillion calculations per second , reports the wall street journal . the supercomputer—which takes up 96 racks , each bigger than a fridge , at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california—can compute in one hour what it would take everybody in the world 320 years working non-stop using hand calculators to compute , the bbc notes . this is the first time an american computer has taken top spot since 2009 , and sequoia also won praise for energy efficiency : it consumes 7.9 megawatts compared to the k computer 's 12.6 megawatts . the department of energy will use sequoia to run simulations designed to help extend the life of aging nuclear weapons , eliminating the need in these cases to run underground nuclear tests . quips engadget 's sean buckley , " more computers , less explosions . we ca n't think of a better thing to do with 98,304 compute nodes , 1.6 million cores , and 1.6 petabytes of memory spread across 96 racks—can you ?
