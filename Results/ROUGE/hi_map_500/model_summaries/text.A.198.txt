a new york city high school senior grabbed plenty of headlines yesterday after being named one of new york magazine 's " reasons we love new york . " what was so loveable and new york-y about mohammed islam ? as the headline of reporter jessica pressler 's piece proclaimed , " because a stuyvesant senior made $ 72 million trading stocks on his lunch break . " except the 17-year-old totally did n't , mohammed now tells the observer 's ken kurson . in an interview that took place in the offices of his newly engaged pr firm , with a lawyer by his side , mohammed says " no , no , yes " as answers to the following : did he , as pressler wrote , make eight figures ? has he invested and made anything off it ? is the story complete fiction ? he tells the observer that he does run an investment club at his school , and that his simulated trades ' return was pretty impressive . and , yeah , he did lead pressler to believe " i had made even more than $ 72 million on the simulated trades . " but as the head of his new pr firm says in a statement to nbc news , " a 17-year old boy who lives in elmhurst , queens , responded to a reporter 's inquiry and created an inaccurate story . ... his millions are about as real as monopoly money . " kurson 's take ? a few minutes with a calculator would have prevented another fact-checking mess . " even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $ 100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at stuy high , he ’ d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796 % over the three years since . c ’ mon , man . " new york , for its part , maintains that " mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures , and he confirmed on the record that he ’ s worth eight figures . "
