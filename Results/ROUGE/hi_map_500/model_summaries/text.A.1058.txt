osama bin laden didn ’ t die after a 45-minute gunfight , according to a new book—he died 90 seconds into the raid , according to seal target geronimo . the new book is by former seal team six leader chuck pfarrer , who says he interviewed the team that killed bin laden . the book says seals landed on the roof , not the ground floor , bursting right into osama ’ s bed chamber , according to advance looks from the daily beast and telegraph . only 12 bullets were fired in the entire raid . but team members confirm there was no kill order , and that they would have captured bin laden if possible . perhaps more damaging for the obama administration is the assertion that the seals resent the president for announcing bin laden ’ s death so quickly . if he hadn ’ t , they believe they could have used intelligence from the raid to launch surprise attacks on al-qaeda leaders—potentially rolling up the organization in six months . us officials , however , have dismissed the book as “ plain wrong . ”
