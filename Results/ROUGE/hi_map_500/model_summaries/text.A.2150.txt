it could finally be tunnel time at stonehenge . nbc news reports that the 1.3 million annual visitors to the famous landmark have been dealing with increasing traffic on a nearby highway for years . officials first proposed a tunnel to cut down on noisy and unsightly traffic yards away on the a303 nearly 30 years ago , but it never materialized . now the british government has finalized plans to build that tunnel , according to the bbc . the 1.8-mile tunnel would include four lanes and cost an estimated $ 1.7 billion . the secretary of england 's department of transport says the tunnel will reduce traffic and travel times near stonehenge . but the tunnel remains controversial , with stonehenge fans weighing in on both sides . one supporter says tourists will " once again be able to hear the sounds of skylarks " instead of traffic . and unesco , which lists stonehenge as a world heritage site , is in favor of the tunnel . but the council for british archaeology is against it , the guardian reports . the council 's president says the area around stonehenge is the " world 's most significant and best-preserved stone-age landscape . " that 's why the stonehenge alliance also opposes the current tunnel plan . the group wants the tunnel length increased to at least 2.7 miles to reduce disruption to the immediate area . officials are accepting public comment on the tunnel through the beginning of march .
