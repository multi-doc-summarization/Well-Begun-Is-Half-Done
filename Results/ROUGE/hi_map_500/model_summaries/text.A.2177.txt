perhaps you expected bad reviews . after all , popstar : never stop never stopping is a mockumentary about a ridiculous bieber-like rapper whose star is fading . but you 're in for a nice surprise . critics are raving about this spoof on celebrity culture , starring andy samberg and a sea of music-industry celebs . here 's what they 're saying : it has all the makings of an " easy-to-watch and enjoyable film . but popstar is smarter than that , " writes anne t. donahue at the globe and mail . " it 's a legitimate look at celebrity culture delivered in a way that 's as funny as it is thought-provoking . " yes , there are dick jokes—which are " great " —but it effectively " holds a magnifying glass up to the culture that we 've all had a hand in creating . " fans of the lonely island , the name given to the comedy trio of samberg , akiva schaffer , and jorma taccone , are in for a " nonstop party time , " writes peter travers at rolling stone . the flick is n't just funny—it 's " insanely funny " and comes " with a surprising amount of heart , " he says , noting " everyone from bieber to kanye gets ribbed in this hilarious mockumentary . " it 's " a pitch-perfect take satirizing modern-day pop stardom " and " front and center , carrying the film , is samberg in what is easily the most winning film performance of his career , " writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times . " it 's funny because it gets it right without ever being too mean-spirited . even the jokes referencing anne frank and osama bin laden are good-natured and almost sweet . almost . " ty burr , however , gives it a 6 or 7 out of 10 . he enjoyed the " sneaky wit of its take on celebrity culture " and the " patented lonely island music numbers , " but he found popstar to be " genial , silly , and instantly forgettable , " he writes at the boston globe . he was particularly bummed to see sarah silverman , tim meadows , and joan cusack " get lost in the shuffle .
