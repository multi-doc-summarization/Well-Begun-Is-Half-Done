bill maher opened his mouth on jimmy kimmel live last night and added his ever-controversial two cents to the discussion of yesterday 's deadly shooting at charlie hebdo . while " most muslim people " would n't carry out such an attack , maher said " hundreds of millions of them support an attack like this . they applaud an attack like this . " maher continued , per raw story , " when you make fun of the prophet , all bets are off . " the daily beast reports an apparently stunned audience was noticeably subdued throughout his rant , in which he said all religions are " stupid and dangerous . " " it 's not my fault that the part of the world that is most against liberal principles is the muslim part of the world , " he said . asking the audience to " turn toward the truth , " he proceeded to attack how muslim countries treat women , gay people , and those who leave islam . " they chop heads off in the square in mecca . well , mecca is their vatican city . if they were chopping the heads off of catholic gay people , would n't there be a bigger outcry among liberals ? " maher said . america 's politically correct liberals were n't free from his critique , either . the daily beast notes maher said those who argue for sensitivity to muslim sensibilities have transformed the us into " pussy nation . "
