karl smith took the witness stand last week in illinois and dropped a bomb on a cook county courtroom as the twin brother he had n't seen in years looked on : " i 'm here to confess to a crime i committed that he was wrongly accused of , " smith said . the part of the story that makes it especially dicey , reports the chicago tribune , is that smith 's identical twin , kevin dugar , has been jailed for the murder of a rival gang member since 2003 . ( the brothers have different last names because smith adopted his mother 's maiden name . ) authorities are skeptical , however . they say smith is falsely confessing because he has exhausted his own appeal of a 99-year sentence for a 2008 home invasion and figures he may as well take the fall for his bother . smith 's " got nothing to lose , " an assistant state 's attorney says , adding that the confession does n't mesh with eyewitness accounts . smith , though , says he let his brother sit in prison because " i did n't have the strength to come forward " and because " i thought it was the job of the police to catch me . " he contends that he decided to come forward after a religious conversion . a judge will decide if dugar will get a new trial . says smith 's mother : " he would n't lie about that . " the bizarre nature of the case is drawing widespread attention , with coverage in the american bar association 's aba journal and oversesa outlets including itv news ( " shocking " ) australia 's perth now ( " stunning " ) . ( in france , authorities struggled to figure out which twin was a rapist . )
