some stores are trying to resist black friday madness by refusing to open on thanksgiving , but for die-hard shoppers , it 's never too early to get ready for the mega-sales . take vicky torres and juanita salas , who were already bundled up and camped out in front of the beaumont , calif. , best buy weeks before everyone starts defrosting their turkeys . they 've been there since last wednesday , abc 7 reports , and they 're " good to go " for the duration , torres says , with warm clothing , hot coffee , and food . " the point is to get the sales , because everybody is on a fixed income and we do n't have that kind of money to splurge , " says salas ' husband , jacob alva . the two women alternate who stays overnight to save their places in line , though there 's no indication from reports that anyone else is actually in said line yet . if both women have to leave for a bathroom break or for any other reason , alva takes over , he tells the san bernardino county sun ; he also charges their phones and brings them sustenance . he 's not particularly worried about his wife 's safety , claiming " the cops and security out here are really good . " torres and salas did the same " fun " thing last yearâ€”best buy 's beaumont manager tells the sun " we love vicky here . " so what 's their holiday must-have this time around ? a 50-inch high-def tv for $ 199 , they tell abc . ( cyber monday might be even bigger than black friday . )
