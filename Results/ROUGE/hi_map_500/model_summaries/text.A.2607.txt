north carolina passed a controversial voter id law in july , but if the department of justice has its way , the law—said to be the most sweeping of its kind in the nation—may never be enforced . the doj will file suit against the state today , a source tells politico and the charlotte observer ; eric holder is expected to make the announcement later today . the suit accuses north carolina of violating the voting rights act by discriminating against black voters , and asks that the state be barred from enforcing the law—which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2016 elections . it also seeks to put north carolina back on a " preclearance " list , meaning all changes to voting laws and procedures would need to first be approved by the doj or a federal court . forty north carolina counties were subject to preclearance until june , when the supreme court struck down part of the voting rights act . but the doj can use another vra provision to attempt to put states back under preclearance , as it is also doing in texas . the problem with the voter id law , as the doj sees it : just 22 % of registered voters in north carolina are african american , but they make up 34 % of the voters who do not have a dmv-issued id ( and thus would not be allowed to vote ) . the doj suit will also take issue with three other parts of the law : the elimination of provisional ballots for voters who go to the incorrect polling place ( 30 % of out-of-precinct voters last year were african american ) ; the elimination of some early voting days ( 29 % of early voters last year were african american ) ; and the elimination of same-day voter registration during early voting ( 41 % of voters using same-day registration were african american ) .
