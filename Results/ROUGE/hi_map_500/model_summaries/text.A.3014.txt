a florida schoolteacher has filed a workplace discrimination lawsuit against her employer for turning her down for a job teaching spanish—even though she does n't speak spanish , the news & observer reports . tracy rosner , who teaches third grade at coral reef elementary in palmetto bay , alleges in her federal complaint against the miami-dade county school board that she applied to be reassigned to teach the extended foreign language ( efl ) track—one of three tracks the school offers its students , in addition to college prep and gifted , per the miami new times—which would require her to teach one hour of spanish per day . rosner says her request was denied , even though she 's " otherwise fully qualified " for the job , and that after she was rejected , the principal upped her workload in retaliation . how rosner says she would get around that pesky fluency requirement : she 'd have another spanish-speaking teacher come in for that one hour a day to instruct her students . she notes in her suit that non-spanish speakers are in the minority in miami-dade county , which " disproportionately affects " her ability to find a suitable job . " ms. rosner was provided a less desirable position and has damages including emotional pain , suffering , inconvenience , mental anguish , [ and ] loss of enjoyment of life , " the suit states . it 's not clear which track rosner had previously been teaching or why she had asked for the reassignment . ( the owner of a milwaukee frozen-custard stand does n't want any language other than english spoken at work . )
