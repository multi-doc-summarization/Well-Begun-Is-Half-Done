a video of defense chief james mattis giving an off-the-cuff pep talk to us troops is gaining traction online . in the clip—see it here—mattis asks the troops to " hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it , " per the guardian . it 's not precisely clear where or when mattis was speaking , but the best guess is that the impromptu speech was delivered in jordan during mattis ' trip there last week , reports the hill . the video was posted to a facebook page called “ us army wtf moments , " apparently because it 's seen as a veiled criticism of president trump and the turmoil generated in the wake of the violence in charlottesville . “ the only way this great big experiment you and i call america is gon na survive is if we ’ ve got tough hombres like you , " mattis tells the troops . " you ’ re a great example for our country right now . it ’ s got some problems . you know it and i know it . it ’ s got problems that we don ’ t have in the military . " at another point , mattis suggested that america had lost its " power of inspiration , " but would get it back . he added that the us has a second power— " the power of intimidation , and that ’ s you , if someone wants to screw with our families , our country and our allies. ” the video was shot before trump signed a memo blocking transgender enlistments but also giving mattis leeway on how to deal with transgender troops currently serving .
