" the numbers require some guesswork , but the lat thinks he went from somewhere between $ 25 million and $ 30 million down to about $ 20 million . finke 's numbers are higher . according to both accounts , leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs , though at least 20 people got layoffs . why the downsizing ? finke says it 's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue , but because parent company comcast is demanding cuts all around . she says the show is still a " cash cow . " the lat , meanwhile , says leno 's prime-time budget never got shaved when he moved back to later hours .
