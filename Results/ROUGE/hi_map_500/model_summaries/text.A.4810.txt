new research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid canada were the most colicky . british babies came in second , followed by italy . the most tranquil tots , meanwhile , live in denmark and germany . writing in the journal of pediatrics , psychologists at the university of warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic—a harmless , if nerve-jangling , condition—by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks . the longest crying jags were clocked in canada , reports the guardian , where 34.1 % of babies wailed more than three hours a day , at least three days a week . in the uk , the tally was 28 % and in italy 20.9 % . relatively blissful danish babes scored 5.5 % , with germany at 6.7 % . the first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks , peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks . happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere , crying time is halved by week 12 , per a press release . lead researcher dieter wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying , allowing the infant to self-soothe . " they don ’ t get all worried about it , " wolke tells the telegraph . then again , he notes , danish babies may enjoy a bit of " genetic bias " since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys . in any case , new parents should learn to chill . " if you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby , " wolke says . ( crying saved this baby 's life . )
