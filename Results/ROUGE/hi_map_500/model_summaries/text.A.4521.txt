three republican state senators in idaho skipped the chamber 's daily invocation yesterday because they objected to the guest chaplain 's religion . the three did n't take their seats until after hindu cleric rajan zed had finished his prayer , which focused on selflessness , the ap reports . " hindu is a false faith with false gods , " said sen. sheryl nuxoll . " i think it 's great that hindu people can practice their religion , but since we 're the senate , we 're setting an example of what we , idaho , believe . " another of the three , sen. steve vick , had tried to have the prayer stopped , warning that a non-christian prayer could " send a message we 're not happy with the way america is , " reports the spokesman-review . " they have a caste system . they worship cows , " vick complained , saying he had plenty of support from constituents who wanted the prayer stopped . several other lawmakers missed the prayer , but they said it was because they were running late . after the prayer , zed—who has delivered hindu prayers for the us house , us senate , and other state legislatures—said hinduism is very inclusive and he did n't mind that some lawmakers had boycotted the prayer . " most of them welcomed me , " he told the spokesman-review . " they came out and shook my hand—some of them hugged me . it was good . there are multiple viewpoints . ... that is what makes the country great , you know ? different viewpoints . "
