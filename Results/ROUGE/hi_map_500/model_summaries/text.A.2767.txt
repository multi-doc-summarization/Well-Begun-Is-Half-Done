lady gaga lays to rest rumors that she 's mixed gender and replaces them with visions of masochistic lesbian love in her latest eye-popping music video . " i told you she did n't have a dick , " one buff female prison guard tells another after stripping lady g in a cell in the video ( watch it here ) for telephone . " too bad , " remarks the other . gaga then struts her stuff in a barely-there thong ( or just evidence tape ) with little space to hide anything along with a chorus of cons and later beyoncé , who kills off a male lover with the help of an über-vamped-up gaga . mtv dubbed the high-budget , 9-minute extravaganza a " hyperkinetic pop-culture joyride " with homages to films like caged heat and kill bill . in fact , bill director quentin tarantino acted as a kind of consultant on the video . " there certainly is a tarantino-inspired quality in the video , " gaga explains to e ! online . " i was telling him about my concept for the video and he loved it so much he said , 'you got ta use the pussy wagon ' " —which is what beyoncé uses to whisk gaga out of prison .
