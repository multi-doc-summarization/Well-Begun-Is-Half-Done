lululemon 's see-through yoga pants sound scandalous , and a scandal is what the company appears to have on its hands . the taiwanese supplier of the pants is hitting back after the yogawear chain blamed its massive pants recall on the manufacturer . " all shipments to lululemon went through a certification process which lululemon had approved , " eclat 's cfo tells the wall street journal . " all the pants were manufactured according to the requirements set out in the contract with lululemon . " writing for the atlantic wire , adam clark estes sums up the drama thusly : " so which one is it ? did eclat make a bad batch of $ 100 yoga pants , or did lululemon just design transparent $ 100 yoga [ pants ] and milk the market for as long as it could ? " for now , it remains unclear , and lululemon may have larger problems on its hands than some potentially see-through pants : this is the fourth quality control issue the chain has experienced in the past year , and some analysts are expressing concern that the company " does not have the appropriate presence in and around its factories . it appears that there is not appropriate oversight in place .
