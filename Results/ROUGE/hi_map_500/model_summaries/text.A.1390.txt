playing pranks on your successor is a tradition among virginia governors . when mark warner moved out of the governor 's mansion in 2006 , for example , he left a life-size cutout of himself in the shower for the recently elected tim kaine , the washington post reports . kaine paid that favor forward four years later when he occasionally called cell phones he 'd left in the elevator shafts to irk his successor , robert mcdonnell . but outgoing gov . terry mcauliffe may have taken the cake saturday night , greeting new gov . ralph northam and his wife , pam , with pillowcases on their new bed plastered with mcauliffe 's image . and right above the image was one of mcauliffe 's favorite lines : " sleep when you 're dead . " northam took his hazing in stride , spending his first night in office with his head rested on the portrait of his predecessor . he also showed a picture he had taken of the pillowcases to reporters at a brunch the next morning . but mcauliffe 's mischief did n't stop there , cbs news reports . he also left pictures of himself throughout the governor 's mansion . and , according to northam , an alarm went off at 3am that first night , an alarm northam has yet to find . " i texted him and thanked him , " northam said , " and he said there was more to come . "
