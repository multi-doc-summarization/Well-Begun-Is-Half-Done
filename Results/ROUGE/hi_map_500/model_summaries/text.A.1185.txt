dining out anytime soon ? true/slant blogger ( and former waitress ) susannah breslin has a little advice on how to treat your server . check out the full list here . a sampling : eye contact : too many people treat servers like they ’ re invisible . do n't be one of them . “ look your server in the eye . the goal of dining out is great service . treating your server like a human being is one way to get it. ” tip : at nice spots , it ’ s 20 % , so deal with it . “ if i just spent several hours running around … and basically acting like your personal slave for the evening , i ’ d like to be reimbursed for it. ” speak up : if you do n't like something , say so . competent servers will deal with it because it 's in their interests to keep you happy . don ’ t make a mess : you may think you ’ re helping by piling up your scraps and dishes . " you are not helping . you are sabotaging . ... leave it . let us get it. ” stay out of the kitchen : self-explanatory . don ’ t be like this guy , who breslin thinks is both " self-indulgent " and " arrogant .
