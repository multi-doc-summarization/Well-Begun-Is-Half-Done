" in a way her strength gave me a strength to keep going , " findlay tells the bbc . " no one believed she was going to make it except us , " adds wilkins . " it 's beyond a miracle . " a pediatric cardiologist says vanellope " has proved very resilient . " the main focus now is to prevent infection , but " in the future we may be able to put in some internal bony protection for her heart , perhaps using 3d printing or something organic that would grow with her .
