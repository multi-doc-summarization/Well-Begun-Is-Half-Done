in a rolling stone cover story on donald trump and his campaign , one particularly crass comment is getting the most attention : writer paul solotaroff says trump made fun of gop rival carly fiorina 's looks when she appeared on tv news , saying , " look at that face ! would anyone vote for that ? can you imagine that , the face of our next president . " solotaroff says trump added , " i mean , she 's a woman , and i 'm not s'posedta say bad things , but really , folks , come on . are we serious ? " trump 's derogatory remarks about women led to his feud with fox news ' megyn kelly , and on kelly 's show last night , fiorina said his remarks about her suggest she may be " getting under his skin a little bit , " the ap reports . analysts tell cnn that the fiorina remarks could cause trump problems at next week 's gop debate , although similar episodes have n't done him much harm . " if you 're waiting for trump to blow himself up in a hindenburg of gaffes or hate speech , you 're in for a long , cold fall and winter , " solotaroff concluded after 10 days with the trump campaign . " donald trump is here for the durationâ€”and gaining strength and traction by the hour . " ( stephen colbert targeted trump on his late show debut . )
