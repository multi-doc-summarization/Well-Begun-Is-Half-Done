mild-mannered bbc political editor nick robinson was transformed into a ball of rage by an anti-war sign being waved in the background as he broadcast from westminster . robinson delivered his broadcast calmly , then turned around , grabbed the sign from the protester , tried to rip it apart , and stamped on it , the independent reports . robinson later wrote on his bbc blog that he regretted losing his temper and erupting in " sign rage . " however , he wrote , " as i explained afterward to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast , there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera .
