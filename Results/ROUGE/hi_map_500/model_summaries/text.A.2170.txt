after more than two weeks of controversy , the associated press has deleted an aug. 23 tweet about the clinton foundation that critics—including hillary clinton—said was misleading . " more than half those who met clinton as cabinet secretary gave money to clinton foundation , " read the tweet . politico notes that the tweet failed to mention that the ap 's analysis of clinton meetings looked only at discretionary meetings and not meetings with federal officials or representatives of foreign governments , which tend to make up the majority of any secretary of state 's meetings . " the tweet fell short of ap standards by omitting essential context , " ap vp for standards john daniszewski writes in a blog post , setting out a new policy for removing tweets , an action that the ap used to see as " retroactively editing a conversation . " clinton and her campaign slammed the tweet and the clinton foundation story soon after it appeared , usa today reports . " it draws a conclusion and makes a suggestion that my meetings with people like the late , great elie wiesel or melinda gates or the nobel prize winner muhammad yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders , " clinton told cnn last month .
