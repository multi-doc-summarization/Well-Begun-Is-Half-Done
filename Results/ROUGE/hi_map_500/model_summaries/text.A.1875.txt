weapons supplied by the us and saudi governments to syrian rebel groups landed in the hands of isis fighters , in some cases in a matter of just weeks , according to a conflict armament research study . the organization 's study of more than 40,000 items retrieved from isis positions in iraq and syria , including guns and ammunition , found that many weapons the us government bought from european suppliers were diverted to isis , including an anti-tank missile component that was found with isis fighters in iraq just 59 days after it left a bulgarian factory and was sold to the us , nbc news reports . car says around a third of isis ' weapons were made in the eu . more than half came from china and russia . " international weapon supplies to factions in the syrian conflict have significantly augmented the quantity and quality of weapons available to is forcesâ€”in numbers far beyond those that would have been available to the group through battlefield capture alone , " car said in its report . the report also detailed unusual finds , including a german rifle from 1941 found with fighters in baghdad , and a cache of 122 chinese-made machine guns found near mosul , each with a pouch of amphetamines attached . car warns that even though isis has now lost most of its territory , it now has the ability to manufacture its own weapons and remains a worldwide threat , deutsche welle reports .
