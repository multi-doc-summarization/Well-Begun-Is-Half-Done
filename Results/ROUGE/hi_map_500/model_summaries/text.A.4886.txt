an illinois woman with five kids was arrested july 7 and briefly thrown in jail for an offense that the town of cahokia obviously feels strongly about : not mowing her lawn , the week reports . single mom ebony conner tells kmov she was verbally warned by a municipal code-enforcement officer back in june and also told to get rid of garbage and broken-down cars from her driveway—but she thought she had more time to fix things , and she definitely did n't think she 'd be hauled off to jail . " i understand i violated a code , but … give me a ticket first , make me appear in court , " she says . " i know there 's got ta be channels other than , 'if you do n't cut your grass , we 're arresting you right now . ' " conner says she hails from wisconsin and has spent time in st. louis , mo. , and she 'd never heard of such a thing in either place . while she was detained ( cops say she was held for about a half-hour in jail ) , her five children remained at home , with just a code enforcement officer patrolling the outside of her house , conner says , adding , " i said ' i do n't trust him . i do n't know him at all . ' … and they still hauled me off . " she says she would 've cut her grass by hand if she had known her long grass was an arrestable offense . the institute for justice lists similar cases that some consider to be an abuse of municipal code enforcement , including those in the town of pagedale , mo. , where residents can be slammed with fines and tickets for such offenses as barbecuing in front of one 's house , having mismatched curtains , and walking on the left-hand side of a crosswalk . ( postal workers mow residents ' lawns in finland . )
