there will be no free ice cream for the 2,000 employees set to fill facebook 's new office in mountain view , calif. , later this year . like many other tech companies in silicon valley , facebook fills the bellies of its employees with free food , from oven-baked pizza to hand-rolled sushi . but that appears to be changing : in an effort to lend support to local restaurants , the city of mountain view has blocked facebook from subsidizing cafeteria meals by more than 50 % , though it can fully subsidize meals had at outside restaurants . " we wanted to make sure businesses that were there were successful , " councilman john mcalister tells the san francisco chronicle of the 2014 agreement , which he says came in response to complaints that google 's free employee meals were hurting local businesses . the goal was " to make sure we did n't have 400,000 square feet of office space with people that never left the building " to visit a local business , says former mountain view mayor michael kasperzak . it 's an idea that caught officials ' attention in san francisco . though it " could mean losing well-paid [ cafeteria ] jobs to minimum-wage jobs in nearby restaurants , " per the guardian , two city legislators on tuesday announced a proposal that would ban workplace cafeterias in new developments . " you get more foot traffic , restaurant and retail patrons , and overall vitality in the streets , " says a rep for the golden gate restaurant association , which is in support of the proposal . " if people are bussed in , go to work and never leave the building , the effect is n't felt . "
