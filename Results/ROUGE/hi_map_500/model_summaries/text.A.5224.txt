a new study on cancer wo n't make for pleasant reading for tall people . consider this quote from lead researcher leonard nunney of the university of california riverside : " if you were comparing a 5-foot guy to a basketball player who 's over 7 feet tall , then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board , " he tells australia 's abc . yes , nunney 's study in the proceedings of the royal society b suggests that taller people are at greater risk for cancer . the surprisingly simple reason ? they have more cells , and thus more things go can wrong in those cells , explains the guardian . specifically , the study found that cancer risk rises by 10 % for every 4 inches people are above average heightâ€”5 feet 4 for women and 5 feet 9 for men , reports cnn . the findings held true for 18 of 23 cancers studied . " now , you ca n't do anything about your height , but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this , and if they have any concerns , to get checked , " says nunney . cancers of the colon and kidney were among those with the strongest correlation to height . a researcher not involved with the study says it backs up previously seen links between height and cancer , but she said tall people should n't worry too much . " the increased risk is small , and there 's plenty you can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer , such as not smoking and keeping a healthy weight , " says georgina hill of cancer research uk .
