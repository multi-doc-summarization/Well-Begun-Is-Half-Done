when harold hayes said he had one helluva war story to tell , he was n't kidding . the 94-year-old , who died on sunday , was the last survivor of 30 intrepid americans who crash-landed behind nazi lines during world war ii , plunging them into a surreal odyssey that included german attacks , blizzards , illness , and near starvation as they trekked 600 miles until their eventual rescue 63 days later . details of their saga was a " long-held-secret " for decades , the new york times reports . it all began on a clear day in november 1943 when a cargo plane carrying nurses and medics from sicily to bari , italy , was blown off course by a major storm and fired on by german flak guns . after ditching in a remote area , the group learned they were in albania from locals . under constant threat of capture , hayes , then 21 , and the others bunked with peasants with little to share except lice-infested blankets . they boiled tea from straw and ate berries . their limbs froze as autumn gave way to white-out blizzards . " when you 're hungry , cold , and tired , you forget about almost everything else and are only thinking about surviving , " hayes said , per national geographic . a british spy found them too sick to go on , and arranged a us air rescue that failed . crushed , the group managed to continue moving west and reached the adriatic coast on jan. 9 . to protect their albanian saviors , they stayed mum during the war and for years after during the communist years . hayes " rarely talked about his ordeal , " author cate lineberry tells the times . ( this lost wwii sub was found off hawaii . )
