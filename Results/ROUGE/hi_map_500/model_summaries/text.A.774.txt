technophobes may be alarmed to learn that new sperm-like robots could soon be performing many activities—including fertilizing human eggs . researchers say the tiny bots , dubbed " magnetosperm , " were inspired by the shape and movement of sperm cells and can " swim " to their target with incredible accuracy , livescience reports . they believe the sperm bots could be useful in nanomanufacturing as well as for medical uses including unclogging arteries , drug administration , and in vitro fertilization . the robots have a metal head and a body of flexible polymer , and are steered through a field produced by electromagnetic coils . " the magnetic head is used to orient it in a certain direction and then , just by flapping its tail , it starts to move forward , " the lead researcher explains to the bbc . " the flapping happens because we change the current in the coils , " he says , predicting that the tiny bots will prove useful where it is necessary to reach " precise locations . " the bots are still a lot slower—and around six times bigger—than human sperm , but the magnetosperm team says it is working on creating smaller , faster versions . ( meanwhile , scientists have recently found the world 's oldest sperm . )
