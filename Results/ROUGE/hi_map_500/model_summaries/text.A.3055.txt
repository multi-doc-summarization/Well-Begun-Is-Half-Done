in case you 've somehow managed to erase this detail from memory , usa today reminds us that exactly one year ago , dennis rodman was singing " happy birthday " to " best friend " kim jong un . today is indeed believed to be the north korean leader 's birthday , but it 's unclear whether he 's 31 , 32 , or 33 . kim 's birth year , per the south korean government , was likely 1982 , 1983 , or 1984 . and while yonhap reports that china sent him birthday wishes , usa today notes there is no elaborate public celebration to mark the day , as was the case with his father 's and grandfather 's birthdays . " there 's a lot of speculation why that 's the case , " a south korean professor tells cnn . " kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy , " or he could just be trying to downplay the fact that he 's young . " when you start marking his birthday , then the whole north korean people will start to wonder , then what 's his age ? " usa today speculates that when his age is finally revealed , 1982 will be the year named , perhaps regardless of whether that 's the truth : his grandfather was born in 1912 , and his father 30 years later . forty years after that is ... 1982 . ( meanwhile , kim 's eyebrows are shrinking . )
