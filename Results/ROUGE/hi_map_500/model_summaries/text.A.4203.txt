it might be the strangest advice imaginable for survivors of a nuclear attack : do n't use hair conditioner . but it turns out to be sound advice as well , reports live science . the matter came up when guam , under threat of an attack by north korea , recently issued safety guidelines to the public . and there among the usual seek-shelter nuggets was the warning that people should use soap and water to rid themselves of toxic dust but avoid the conditioner . it 's all because of how the stuff works , and the upshot it that it could actually cause radioactive particles to bind to your hair . hair is shaped almost like scales , which can open up and come apart throughout the day . conditioner uses compounds like silicone and cationic polymers to pull these scales back down and smooth it , one cosmetic chemist tells racked . conditioner is also oily , and any oily products like lotions or cosmetics are likely to encourage fallout to stick around . so there you have it : wash with soap and shampoo , but let your hair frizz out . npr also took a look at those safety guidelines and highlights one that would come in handy should doomsday arrive : if you see a flash , get inside anywhere as fast as you can to reduce exposure to fallout , and remove your outer layer of clothing . ( dandruff shampoo could be harming our water . )
