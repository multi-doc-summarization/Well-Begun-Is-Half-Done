" mama ’ s done playing games and being a doormat . " that was an australian mother 's message to her 13-year-old son when she decided to charge him more than $ 700 a month for rent , electricity , internet , and food , kidspot reports . according to cbs news , it all started when the single-mother 's son told her she could n't control him and bragged , " at least one of us is making money , " during a fight over homework . she 's unemployed , and the teen apparently makes a small income from his youtube channel . deciding her son was acting more like a bad roommate , the woman—going by estrella havershim—wrote a letter to him outlining his new bills and shared it on facebook , where it went viral , seventeen reports . it 's been shared more than 160,000 times as of this story . in addition to the above bills , the letter and its accompanying facebook post assigned the teen chores in lieu of a $ 30 maid 's fee and a $ 3 per day charge for renting his clothes , kidspot reports . " if you decide you would rather be my child again , instead of a roommate , we can renegotiate terms , " the letter concludes . though she took flak from people calling the letter too harsh , she also drew support from people around the world , with one facebook comment reading , “ kids these days need a hard lesson so that they become better adults . " cbs notes another stated , " we need more parents like you . " the tough-love letter apparently worked , with the rebellious teen eventually paying with chores and an apology instead of money . ( for parents with bratty kids , there 's hope on another front , too . )
