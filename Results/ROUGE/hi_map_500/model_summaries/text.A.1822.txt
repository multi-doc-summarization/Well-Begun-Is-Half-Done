an indiana mom made a heart-wrenching choice , and now her community is rallying around her . dozens showed up for a candlelight vigil sunday in richmond to support mary york , who called 911 thursday to warn that her son was going to dennis intermediate school with a gun , per abc news and wthr . police confronted 14-year-old brandon clegg at the school and engaged him in a shootout before he took his own life . clegg 's family says he had been bullied at school , which they say is no justificationâ€”just an explanation of what happened . " it destroys me to think that a kid would have to go and show his anger at a school and that he would go as far as shooting at people ... " says his cousin , thomas york . " it sucks . " but most of the attention is going to brandon 's mom , 42 , who made a difficult phone call that almost certainly saved lives . " she 's a human . she 's a mother , " says vigil organizer shawn wright . " she lost her child . " as an indiana state police superintendent tells wcpo : " if [ york ] had n't made that call , we 'd be having a much different conversation right now . " ( on the sixth anniversary of sandy hook , there was a nerve-wracking morning . )
