scott pruitt is no longer head of the environmental protection agency , but the saga of his $ 43,000 phone booth is n't quite over . the washington post is out with one last financial tidbit courtesy of the sierra club , which sued the epa to access records related to pruitt . it learned , per verizon phone logs , that pruitt made a single outgoing call from the soundproof phone booth . the five-minute call was placed to the white house on jan. 29 . the epa on monday said it learned it could n't provide the incoming call logs without subpoenaing verizon , so any details on calls pruitt may have received from the white house in the booth are n't available .
