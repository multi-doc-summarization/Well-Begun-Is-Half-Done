the passengers on southwest flight 3606 were somewhere over idaho sunday when their captain came over the pa with a message : they were headed back to seattle . that 's because there was a " life-critical cargo shipment " that had been left on board , per the seattle times : a donated human heart . the heart should have been left in washington after arriving from sacramento , but instead it stayed on the plane and was dallas-bound before the airline realized it had n't been removed at sea-tac airport . cnn and its affiliate ktxl note that this heart was n't intended for a full transplant ; it was donated for its valves alone . that means a ) it was in a thermally controlled box in the cargo hold , making it easier to forget , and b ) it had , per ktxl , a " much longer transportation window " than if it had been intended for a heart transplant . luckily , no damage came to it , and the heart got to where it needed to go on time , per the sierra donor services nonprofit . the passengers , meanwhile , were n't too irked , as they were " happy to save a life , " one man on board tells the times . ( another organ donor was 107 years old . )
