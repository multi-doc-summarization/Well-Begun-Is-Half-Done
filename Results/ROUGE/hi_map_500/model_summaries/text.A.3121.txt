an aussie tv personality has worn the same suit on-air for a full year , and not because he likes the smell . karl stefanovic , a presenter on australia 's morning news show today , says he kept wearing the blue burberry knock-off to make a point : " no one has noticed ; no one gives a s -- t , " he says . " but women , they wear the wrong color and they get pulled up . they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them . " and stefanovic has seen co-host lisa wilkinson—with whom he 's had an admittedly rocky relationship—raked over the coals because her outfit happens to offend a few fans , reports the sydney morning herald . unlike wilkinson , " i 'm judged on my interviews , my appalling sense of humor—on how i do my job , basically , " stefanovic says . he was particularly offended when the telegraph ran old photographs of a female co-host on a rival morning show , dressed in comfortable clothes while running errands . " she 's a mate and she was hurt by that , " says stefanovic , who offered her his support . " and i can understand . " hundreds of tweets ( mostly favorable ) reacted to stefanovic 's well-worn suit , the age reports , with comments like " i loved this so much ! bloody double standards , well played karl xx " and " absolutely brilliant stuff . " others , not so much : a member of a feminist facebook page called the suit experiment " superficial , " while an analyst on jezebel saw nothing new : " as hilarious and interesting as this is , he simply proved something we all already know , the double standard women deal with on a day-to-day basis , " isha aran writes . ( another recent viral video shows a woman getting 108 catcalls in 10 hours while walking around new york city . )
