an estimated 200,000 salvadorans and their 190,000 us-born children are n't the only people stressed out about the administration 's decision to withdraw temporary protected status : the government of el salvador , which estimates 95 % of tps holders are employed or own businesses in the us , says it will " face a great challenge " if tens of thousands are deported after sept.19 , 2019 , when the protection from deportation introduced after two deadly earthquakes in 2001 expires . but salvadoran officials do n't think it will come to that . foreign minister hugo martinez tells the washington post that the government will lobby congress to find a way for people losing tps status to remain legal us residents . " we think we have sufficient time and will work hard for this alternative , " he says . congressional democrats support finding a way for the salvadorans to stay , though they have multiple other immigration issues to deal with , reuters reports . advocates warn that el salvador has one of the world 's highest murder rates , making it a dangerous place to deport people to—and that its economy will be devastated if it loses billions of dollars in remittances from the us . " this is really bad news for our country , " nayib bukele , the mayor of san salvador , tells the los angeles times . " our country does n't create opportunities for the salvadorans who live here . imagine what we 're going to do with 200,000 more coming in . " experts say that if there are mass deportations , many former tps holders are likely to try to move to the us illegally—as will some salvadorans displaced by the skilled and bilingual new arrivals .
