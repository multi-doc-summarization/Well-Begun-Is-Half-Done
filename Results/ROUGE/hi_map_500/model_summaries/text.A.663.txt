the wife of an alabama state senator helps run his facebook account , so she 's plenty familiar with all the women sending her husband come-hither photos and messages . " no more ! " wrote heather mcgill on facebook on monday night , in a diatribe spotted by gawker . " it is a shame that people are so heartless that they would try to split up families , " wrote mcgill , who warned that she 's going to start publicly naming people if it continues ( though she noted that these women " may not even be real " ) . husband shadrack says he supports his wife 's post and tells al.com that it also stems from some real-life incidents during his last campaignâ€”including one in which two strippers showed up at the family 's home late one night . he also says his facebook page got " hijacked " more than once , and " women sent me pictures of themselves half-naked , saying , ' i had a great time last night with shadrack mcgill . ' that sort of thing . " his wife wants to put an end it to it all , he says . ( the last time the lawmaker made headlines was when he cited " biblical principle " to argue against giving raises to teachers . )
