bernie sanders is raising a lot more money than many people expected , and he 's doing it a lot faster . his campaign announced just before the wednesday filing deadline that it has received more than a million online donations , making him the first 2016 candidate to pass that milestone and the first ever to pass it so early , reports the wall street journal , which notes that the obama campaigns got there in february 2008 and october 2011 . according to the filing , sanders ' fundraising is rapidly catching up with hillary clinton 's , with the vermont senator raising $ 25 million in the third quarter of this year , not far off the $ 28 million his rival raised during the same period , although her second-quarter numbers were much higher , cnn reports . most of clinton 's cash in the third quarter came from the 58 fundraising events she headlined that asked donors to pay $ 2,700 , cnn reports , while almost all of sanders ' take came from the online operation , which had an average donation of $ 24.86 . but he has had to spend money to make money : the new york times estimates that the sanders campaign has already spent $ 15 million , mostly on hiring staff and on online fundraising , without spending much on commercials or polling . politico calls his haul " eye-popping " and notes that it undercuts arguments that sanders could n't compete with a well-funded republican . clinton , however , has affiliated super pacs on her side and sanders shuns such groups . ( polls show that clinton is falling behind in new hampshire . )
