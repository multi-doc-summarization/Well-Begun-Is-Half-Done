day three of the brett kavanaugh confirmation hearing has opened with a bang : democratic sen. cory booker says he has ordered his staff to release a kavanaugh email even though it 's supposed to remain under wraps . it 's not clear yet what the email says , but nbc news reports that it concerns racial profiling . booker called his act one of civil disobedience , reports npr . " i openly invite and accept the consequences , " he said , per cnn . " the penalty comes with potential ousting from the senate . " indeed , senate majority whip john cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges " the secret or confidential business " of the senate faces expulsion , reports the washington post . " bring the charges , " said booker . " all of us are ready to face that rule , " added fellow democrat richard blumenthal . democrats have been chafing that too many of kavanaugh 's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing . booker 's stand comes after the new york times obtained some of those off-limits emails . in one from 2003 , when kavanaugh was working in the white house of george w. bush , he objects to language that roe v. wade is " settled law . " he was going over a draft opinion stating that " it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that roe v. wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land , " but he took exception to the phrase . " i am not sure that all legal scholars refer to roe as the settled law of the land at the supreme court level since court can always overrule its precedent , and three current justices on the court would do so , " he wrote at the time . as the times notes , kavanaugh did n't state his personal opinion on the matter .
