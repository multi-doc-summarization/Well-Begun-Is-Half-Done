score one for cnn over the white house . a federal judge on friday ordered the trump administration to immediately return the white house press credentials of reporter jim acosta , per the ap . us district court judge timothy kelly , an appointee of president trump , announced his decision following a hearing in washington . cnn had asked for acosta 's credentials restored while a lawsuit over his credentials ' revocation goes forward . “ i just want to thank all my colleagues in the press who supported me this week , " said acosta , per the washington post . " i want to thank the judge [ for this ruling ] . and let ’ s go back to work. ” the white house revoked acosta 's credentials after he and trump tangled during a press conference last week . the judge said the government could not say who initially decided to revoke acosta 's hard pass . the white house had spelled out its reasons for revoking his credentials in a tweet from white house press secretary sarah sanders , who accused acosta of " placing his hands " on a female intern trying to take away his microphone . but the judge said those " belated efforts were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process . " the judge also found that acosta suffered " irreparable harm , " dismissing the government 's argument that cnn could just send other reporters to cover the white house in acosta 's place . ( video of the dispute was controversial , too . )
