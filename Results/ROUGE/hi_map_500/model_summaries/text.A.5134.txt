eman ahmed abd el aty 's family says the 36-year-old egyptian woman has n't left her home in 25 years , the bbc reports . her extreme weight forced her to crawl instead of walk by age 11 , and an ensuing stroke left her bedridden . her family says she weighs more than 1,100 pounds , which would make her the heaviest woman alive—the current guinness record-holder is only 643 pounds—and close to the heaviest woman ever , according to the washington post . while abd el aty 's weight has n't been confirmed , dr. muffazal lakdawala in india estimates she is at least 990 pounds based on photos of her . " my initial reaction was ' ‘ how is she even alive ? ' " he says . his next reaction was to try to save her . abd el aty is expected to arrive in mumbai for surgery in the next 10 days , but it wo n't be an easy journey . " in every sense , she 's a challenge , " lakdawala says . the bariatric surgeon has been raising money to get her to mumbai and will be operating pro bono , the times of india reports . but it 's not just money that 's an issue . because she ca n't leave her room , abd el aty was unable to make it to the indian embassy to be fingerprinted for a visa ; only a personal plea from lakdawala secured her an exemption . and while transporting abd el aty will be challenging in its own right , lakdawala says the surgery itself is " very high risk . " he says he 's " hopeful " but not " confident " he can help abd el aty lose up to 300 pounds . ( for the obese , objects are closer than they appear . )
