defendants in federal drug cases are getting unfairly sentenced , thanks to mandatory minimums and unchecked power wielded by the justice department , according to a human rights watch report . prosecutors basically " force " defendants into pleading guilty with threats of lengthy sentences and stacked-up charges if the case goes to trial , the study states . " prosecutors can say , 'take these 10 years or , if you get a trial and are convicted , you 're going to look at life , " study author jamie fellner tells the huffington post . " that 's a pretty amazing power that unfortunately they are more than willing to wield . " just 3 % of cases went to trial last year , and of those , 89 % of defendants lost . on average , they were given an extra 11 years in prison compared with those who took a plea deal , npr reports . in one case , a 53-year-old woman with no prior convictions was given " effectively a life sentence " of 45 years for dealing meth and having guns in her house ; she had refused a plea deal of 17 years . " when you have innocent people tempted and also maybe pleading guilty just to avoid the possibility of a really long sentence , that does n't give you a whole lot of faith in the integrity of the system , " fellner says . as for eric holder 's promised reform : fellner says she 's already found cases where prosecutors have failed to take his advice .
