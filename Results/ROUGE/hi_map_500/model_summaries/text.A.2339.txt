a recent essay on quartz by kristi coulter has been making waves on social media , with a ( now-sober ) coulter saying she thinks 21st-century women guzzle too much hooch to forget about the sexist world we live in . ann friedman offers her own take , writing for the washington post that even though she takes some of coulter 's " well-written " points to heart , she 's not completely on board with coulter 's conclusion , noting it 's " difficult to separate what is and is n't related to the patriarchy . " " did i get drunk last night because of the patriarchy ? who knows , " she says , listing other woman-related issues ( e.g. , a penchant for short hair , picking at one 's cuticles ) that could theoretically be linked to a male-dominated society . friedman lays out why she 's reluctant to fully toast coulter 's thesis , noting many men also drink to deal with the day-to-day , and that pop culture—especially via boozy women protagonists on tv and in the movies—has much to do with it , too , presenting alcohol " as both a coping mechanism and a bonding tool . " and she cites her own personal imbibing , relaying how her boozing sessions tend to serve a more active " plotting " purpose to direct her " outrage , " with her drinking buddies serving as sounding boards . " maybe patriarchy does drive us to drink , just as patriarchy drives us to shave our legs and wear bright lipstick , " she concludes . " or maybe it doesn ’ t , and we get drunk for the same reasons that men do . either way , i 'm less concerned about what draws women together over a bottle of wine , and more interested in what we do once we get there .
