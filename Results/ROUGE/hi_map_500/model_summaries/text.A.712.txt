president trump thinks tiger woods ' interviewing skills are as good as his golf ones , or so he suggested in a monday tweet . after finishing up the northern trust tourney sunday , the golfer was asked by the press about his relationship with trump , whom he has golfed with on several occasions . woods said simply , " i 've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency , " adding that they 've both golfed and dined together . espn reports he was then " pressed " about what appears to be a warm relationship . his response : " well , he 's the president of the united states . you have to respect the office . no matter who is in the office , you may like , dislike personality or the politics , but we all must respect the office . " he was finally asked if he had comments about race in america , and said , " no . i just finished 72 holes and am really hungry . " trump 's monday reply on twitter : " the fake news media worked hard to get tiger woods to say something that he didn ’ t want to say . tiger wouldn ’ t play the game - he is very smart . more importantly , he is playing great golf again ! " the great golf part is debatable : the ap reports he tied for 40th place , 14 shots behind winner bryson dechambeau . ( though he did come close at the british open . )
