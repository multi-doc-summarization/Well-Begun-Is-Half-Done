when friday 's blue moon arrives , do n't expect it to be blueâ€”a blue moon is n't actually that color , reports cnn , though some full moons can indeed have a bluish hue . the phrase " once in a blue moon " refers to something that is rare , and it was once used this way in the maine farmers ' almanac when describing the third full moon in the rare season that has four ( typically , there is only one full moon a month , thus a three-month season will have three full moons ) . but in 1946 , sky & telescope magazine published an article that misunderstood this definition , instead calling the second full moon in a calendar month a blue moon . and it is indeed fairly rare : it happens once every 2.7 years or so . this has become the modern definition and is used to describe friday 's full moon , which is the second this month ( the first was on july 2 ) ; it 'll be the last of its kind until january 2018 . interestingly , while the most recent blue moon according to this modern definition occurred at the end of august of 2012 , the most recent blue moon according to the original definition occurred more recently , in august of 2013 , when the full moon was the third of four that summer . as for the blue moon on july 31 , while it may seem to last all night , it 's technically an " instantaneous event " that occurs at 6:43am edt on the nose , reports space.com . ( earlier this month , a man took an incredible picture of the international space station passing in front of the moon . )
