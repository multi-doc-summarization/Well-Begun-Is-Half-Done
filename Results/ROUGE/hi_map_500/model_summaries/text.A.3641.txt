after a kayaker 's close call was followed by massachusetts ' first great white shark attack since 1936 , authorities have some advice for cape cod swimmers : stay away from seals . more than 300,000 grey seals now live in the area—30 times more than in the '60s—and their presence has attracted plenty of great whites , notes the globe and mail . the seal-hunting sharks lurk offshore as seals leave or return to beaches , making the area where the bottom drops off a very bad place to swim if you do n't want to be mistaken for a seal by a hungry shark , experts say . tourism officials hope the attack wo n't be too bad for business . " not to downplay the nasty experience the bitee has had , but there are sharks in the ocean , " the director of the state 's tourism office says . " there ’ s a lot of signs and notices about where it is safe to swim and where it is not . people should stay away from seals . " the bitee himself , a 50-year-old man from denver , suffered serious leg injuries but was released from the hospital yesterday—and he is n't holding a grudge against the shark . " i ’ ll be biting into a nice steak tonight and probably not thinking too hard about it , " he told the boston herald . " so i can ’ t get too mad at the shark either . "
