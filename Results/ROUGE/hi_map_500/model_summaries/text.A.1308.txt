less than a third of political donations come from women , according to a new study . researchers analyzed the money given to candidates , political action committees , and party committees in 2010 and discovered that only 26 % of federal contributions came from female donors , a dip from 31 % in 2008 , and 27 % in 2006 , reports the daily caller . “ women are far more motivated to want to see changes in their neighborhood and city on a social level than men are , but they have not yet made that connection [ with politics ] , ” says the president of the group she should run , which co-released the study . “ in fact , women , far more than men , see the hard , sausage-making dimension of politics as something they are not willing to be engaged in . they find it distasteful . ”
