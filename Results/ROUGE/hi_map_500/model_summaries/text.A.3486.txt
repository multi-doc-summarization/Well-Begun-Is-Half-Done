a july report describing near starvation in myanmar 's rakhine state has been expunged from the un websiteâ€”at myanmar 's request . myanmar was upset with the report 's claim that military forces were blocking access to food for the rohingya even before a government crackdown led 537,000 to flee to bangladesh , per npr . but the guardian reports the un 's world food program might have its own reasons for wanting the report erased . according to one source , un officials knew the report was " potentially damaging , " as it suggested wfp food aid cuts to the rohingya over a two-year period were causing harm , even starvation . " there was a real sense that they had things to hide , " the source says . the wfp tells a very different story : the agency " stands by its original assessment " that 80,000 rohingya children under the age of five were suffering from potentially fatal weight loss in rakhine in july . however , the food situation will have changed since an " upsurge in violence " in august , " just months before the next harvest , " a rep tells the telegraph . " in a dynamic and evolving situation , it is important to coordinate closely with all partners , including the government , " wfp adds , noting its decision to scrap the previous report came " following a request by the government to conduct a joint review . " that review has stalled with myanmar keeping agencies out of the conflict zone , however . the wfp says it 's continuing to push for access .
