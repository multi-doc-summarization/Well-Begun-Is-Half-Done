a kayaker hoping to reel in some salmon on lake michigan instead found himself face-to-snout with a 4-foot alligator on monday . david castaneda was fishing off waukegan harbor when he spotted the reptile swimming slowly with its mouth taped shut , reports the lake county news-sun . " i was just in shock , " says castaneda , who sent authorities a video to confirm the alligator was n't a toy . once rescued , it was taken to wildlife discovery center in lake forest , where officials hope to nurse it back to health . though the animal 's condition remains unclear , curator rob carmichael says the gator was thin and likely would 've died within a couple of weeks as " lake michigan is only getting colder and colder . " an effort is now being made to trace the foreigner ; an investigation will examine whether the exotic animal was abandoned against the law , says city spokesman david motley . " these creatures are not indigenous , " he tells the milwaukee journal sentinel . " you can imagine the skepticism that came with it . "
