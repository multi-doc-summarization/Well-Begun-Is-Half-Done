authorities are ready to release tamerlan tsarnaev ’ s body to his family , but family members—so far—have nowhere to hold the funeral . the boston-area mosque the family attends declined a request to hold the suspected boston bomber 's burial and funeral there , tsarnaev 's aunt tells nbc news . and over the weekend , the leader of an organization that arranges islamic burials and funerals in the boston area told the huffington post , " i would not be willing to do a funeral for him . " " this is a person who deliberately killed people , " says the aforementioned leader . " there is no room for him as a muslim . he already left the fold of islam by doing that . in the quran it says those who will kill innocent people , they will dwell in the hellfire . " dozens of other islamic organizations and mosques have distanced themselves from the tsarnaev brothers , but an imam from boston 's biggest mosque says that while he would n't feel ethically comfortable leading a prayer for tamerlan , " i would not stop people from praying upon him . "
