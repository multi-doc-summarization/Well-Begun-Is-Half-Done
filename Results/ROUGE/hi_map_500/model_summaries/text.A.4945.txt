pooping in space " is n't glamorous , but it is necessary for survival , " an astronaut explainsâ€”yet it 's presenting quite a challenge for nasa . see , while the international space station has a pretty fancy toilet , an astronaut must wear a diaper during launch and landing activities or while spacewalking . but as nasa looks toward future missions in deep space , it 's also looking for a way for astronauts to relieve themselves while remaining in their space suits for up to six days , reports time . that 's where you come in . the agency is offering a $ 30,000 prize in a " space poop challenge " if someone can create " a system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body , without the use of hands . " there are plenty of stipulations . for example , the system " needs to take no more than five minutes [ to set up ] " as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency , per space.com . while such a challenge might seem humorous , a solution " could be the difference between life and death , " notes the contest website . " you do n't want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days , " nasa adds in a release . " given enough time , infection , and even sepsis can set in , " says astronaut rick mastracchio in a video . inventors have until dec. 20 to submit their entries . nasa plans to test the top entries next year , with a solution executed within three years . ( a scientist thinks humans could get to mars in a month . )
