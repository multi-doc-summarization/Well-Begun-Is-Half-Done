a faith ministry in nebraska has started a fundraising campaign to buy out four stores that sell millions of cans of beer each year in a tiny village next to a south dakota indian reservation plagued by alcoholism . the lakota hope street ministry in whiteclay , neb. , is looking to raise at least $ 6.3 million to close the stores , which are only about 200 yards from the pine ridge indian reservation . the officially dry reservation is plagued by high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome and encompasses some of the nation 's poorest counties . whiteclay only has about a dozen residents , yet the four stores sold 3.5 million cans of beer in 2015 . the beer stores have remained opened for decades despite state investigations into alleged liquor law violations , lawsuits , and protests that occasionally turned violent , reports the ap . ministry founder bruce bonfleur and his wife have lived in whiteclay for nearly two decades , feeding people on the streets and launching programs designed to help members of the oglala sioux tribe . bonfleur said he has talked with the businesses , and " we believe that the beer store owners are ready to sell out . " the stores have been facing increasing legal and political pressure , and the nebraska liquor control commission is set to meet march 7 to discuss the stores ' liquor licenses amid complaints that the village lacks adequate law enforcement . last month , the local county board with jurisdiction over whiteclay recommended that the state renew the licenses , partially amid concerns that closing the stores would lead to an increase of intoxicated drivers in nebraska .
