family guy humor works on the family guy , but not , apparently , on a drinks ' menu . a staten island bar and restaurant has retired its " roofie colada " and apologized to patrons offended by what they saw as a date-rape joke , reports fox news . the phunky elephant put the vokda and kahlua drink on the menu over the summer as a salute to the animated show , whose character quaqmire is known to order it for his dates . complaints began surfacing in person and online , but the restaurant initially shrugged them off , reports staten island live . " for the record , you know that there are n't any 'date rape ' drugs in this dessert , right ? " went one facebook reply from the restaurant a while back . but with criticism gathering social-media steam , patricia gaja pulled the drink and said it would be renamed . " we certainly did not intend to create an impression of reckless or negligent behavior , " she wrote . " nor did we mean to make anyone feel uncomfortable or insulted . "
