some people believe kim kardashian is a menace to the thinking public , but peta has stronger words for the reality-tv star : the animal rights group is calling her downright " dangerous " and " intrusive " to animals after kim k posted an instagram video of her cruising around on captive dolphins and puckering up for a sea lion during a mexican vacation , reports radar online . " touch tanks and 'swim-with ' programs … invade the animals ' already diminished world , " says a peta spokeswoman . peta 's website also notes that " animals in 'petting pools ' can become injured and anxious as a result of constant poking and prodding , and exposure to bacteria that they are not immune to can make them ill. " it 's not the first-time kim k has had a run-in with peta : in 2012 , the organization railed against her for threatening to sue a woman who tossed flour on her for wearing fur—a move that prompted sis khloe to snatch her support for the group . peta does n't appear to care one iota what khloe or any of the kardashians think about its animal advocacy . “ kim is free to leave the pool , but for the dolphins , it ’ s a lifetime sentence , ” the spokeswoman says . ( peta presumably would not be a fan of kim 's face turning up on the $ 20 bill . )
