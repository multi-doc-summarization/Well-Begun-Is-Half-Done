ken bone and his bright red sweater became internet famous sunday night when he rose to ask a question on energy policy of hillary clinton and donald trump . ( the " real hero of the debate , " pronounced quartz , which rounds up some of the social media love . ) bone , for his part , seems to be taking it with a dose of good humor . he appeared on cnn monday morning , deliberately re-wearing his now-famous sweater . “ i had a really nice olive suit that i love a great deal and my mother would have been very proud to see me wearing on television , but apparently i have gained about 30 pounds , and when i went to get in my car the morning of the debate i split the seat of my pants all the way open , ” he explained . “ so the red sweater is plan b , " he said , per politico . " i ’ m glad it worked out . " as for the debate itself , bone said it got " very uncomfortable " at times because of the personal digs , almost " like watching mom and dad fight . " he added that he 's more confused than ever about who to vote for , though he chided trump for dredging up bill clinton 's scandals , which " has very little to do with hillary clinton 's ability to be president . " bone is evidently a former domino 's pizza manager from missouri and a classic-car enthusiast , reports slate . and the atlanta journal-constitution has you covered if you want to buy a similar sweater .
