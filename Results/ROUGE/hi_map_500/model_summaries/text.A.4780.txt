the engineer apparently knew the amtrak train that derailed monday in washington state , killing three people and injuring more than 70 , was going too fast . he just did n't know it in time . in a preliminary report , the national transportation safety board states the engineer , who was in the cab with the conductor , commented on " an over speed condition " just six seconds before the crash , nbc news reports . it remains unclear why the train , the first run on a new route , was going nearly 80mph as it entered a 30mph zone . the ntsb review also found neither the conductor nor other crew were using cellphones or other personal electronic devices , as had been the case in previous crashes , according to the los angeles times .
