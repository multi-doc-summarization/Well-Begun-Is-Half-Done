colorado 's animas river is n't always bright orange , but that 's how it looks today after the epa accidentally spilled a million gallons of mine waste into a tributary . officials in san juan county say state officials and the epa were actually trying to access contaminated water at gold king mine in southwest colorado on wednesday when they " unexpectedly triggered a large release of mine waste water into the upper portions of cement creek , " report time and the durango herald . the acidic water—described by one witness as " the filthiest yellow mustard water you 've ever seen " —contains sediment and metals that could irritate the skin , reports the ap . there 's no risk to drinking water , but residents of communities along the river have been urged to cut back on water usage until the plume moves on . yesterday the plume reached durango , colo. , which had stopped pumping water out of the river on wednesday . " it 's really , really ugly , " says a la plata county official . " any kind of recreational activity on the river needs to be suspended . " the waste is now making its way to new mexico , as the animas river meets up with the san juan river in that state before the san juan joins the colorado river in utah . officials have placed cages of fish in the river to identify any ill effects and are testing the water to identify the specific metals released . an expert guesses the water contains high concentrations of iron , aluminum , cadmium , zinc , and copper , based on previous contamination . it may also contain mercury , lead , and arsenic , he says , " but there 's no evidence of that at this point . " ( one texas town recently experienced a creepy water problem . )
