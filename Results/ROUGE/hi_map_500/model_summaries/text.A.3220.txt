leading tea partier martin williams labeled president obama a " half-white " racist in an email to other tea party express leaders unearthed by tpm . williams appears to be responding to accusations of racism himself in the email , which refers to a cnn interview in which anderson cooper made " false allegations " that he had called obama a nazi . in the email , williams claims to have a strong civil rights record and , apparently jumbling his words , writes : " i will defend my record on race to no one under any circumstances . " williams ' tea party express branch has been slammed as " astroturf " by other factions of the movement . " williams is not someone i would want being my spokesman , " a leader of the tea party patriots wrote to the huffington post . " he comes off as an arrogant , self promoting , egotistical jerk . "
