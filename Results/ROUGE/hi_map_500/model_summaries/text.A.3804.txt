there 's a burning question in the days leading up to this year 's burning man : who let the bugs out ? and while that may seem like an ordinary question at the start of any burning man , this year it 's particularly literal as early-arriving burners photograph an apparent infestation ahead of the festival 's start on aug. 30 , reports business insider . the complaint originated on the burning man blog , where john curley wrote : " it ’ s not a localized occurrence , it ’ s everywhere . we don ’ t know where they came from , but there are two main theories : one is that all the spring and summer rain has hatched critters that lie dormant , or usually come to life at a different time of year . or maybe they hitchhiked in on a load of wood . " the bugs are clearly bloodthirsty , reports sf weekly , with images of bites now making the rounds . one woman reportedly had a bug fly into her mouth and lodge itself between her teeth . ( apparently they taste bitter . ) another wrestled one out of her bra . a self-described entomologist is calling them winged ants and stink bugs . time will soon tell if the bugs put a damper on the impending festivities , because the critters are clearly no picnic . " they bite , " curley writes . " they crawl all over you . they get up and in you . " and so far , they do n't seem to mind the burning hot desert sun .
