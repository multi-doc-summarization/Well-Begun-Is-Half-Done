there are a lot of cats in the united states . perhaps close to 95 million live with us as pets , reports the times-picayune . but does our affection for these feline friends move in just one direction ? new research in the journal plos one suggests that domesticated cats are more independent than dogs because they have less " secure attachment " to their owners . in this case , attachment " is not simply an affectionate bond , " the researchers write , but relates to " the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments . " past research has indicated that some cats whose owners leave them alone display signs of separation anxiety , as dogs do . " but the results of our study show that they are in fact much more independent than canine companions , " says lead researcher daniel mills . " it seems that what we interpret as separation anxiety might actually be signs of frustration . " behavioral scientists at the university of lincoln in the uk tested this by observing cats in unfamiliar environments with their owners , with strangers , and alone . they were looking for three distinct characteristics of attachment : the amount of contact a cat sought , its level of passive behavior , and its distress when the owner was absent . cats were , it turns out , more vocal when their owners left them than when strangers did , but they demonstrated no other signs of attachment , hence the possibility that the vocalization was not one of longing ; the researchers posit it could indicate frustration or just be a " learned response . " " our findings don â€™ t disagree with the notion that cats develop social preferences or close relationships , " says mills , " but they do show that these relationships do not appear to be typically based on a need for safety and security . " ( one woman 's attempt to rescue her cat from a cliff did n't go so well . )
