after months of headlines about the heavy drinking culture at stanford thanks to the brock turmer rape case , the university has announced new rules on drinking : no more hard alcohol at undergrad parties , reports the stanford daily . beer and wine are still ok , but no booze more than 40 proof or 20 % alcohol by volume . undergrads can still keep hard alcohol in their dorm rooms , provided the bottles are smaller than 750ml . “ our intention is not a total prohibition of a substance , but rather a targeted approach that limits high-risk behavior , " says a school official . critics , however , think the new rules carry risks of their own—specifically , students " pre-gaming " in their rooms before parties . “ i actually think this is putting students in danger , ” stanford law professor michele landis dauber , who has been critical of the school 's sexual assault policies , tells the guardian . “ it ’ s going to drive it underground … and encourage this super quick consumption not in a public area. ” the turner case " highlighted for many women ’ s advocates how sex assault cases are often trivialized as a result of the college drinking culture , " observes the san francisco chronicle , though a campus spokeswoman says the new policy is not directly related to the case .
