a new study finds that following the mediterranean diet could add about 4.5 years to your life . researchers found that the diet , which focuses on fruits , veggies , whole grains , and olive oil , is good for our dna , the new york times reports . nearly 4,700 women were followed for more than 20 years , and those whose diets were more similar to the mediterranean diet had longer telomeres—protective structures found on the ends of chromosomes that " are often compared to the plastic caps that prevent shoelaces from unravelling , " as larry husten explains at forbes . shorter telomeres have been linked to shorter life expectancy and chronic diseases associated with aging . chromosomes store our dna code , and telomeres help to prevent the loss of genetic information—so the mediterranean diet appears to " stop our dna code from scrambling as we age , " thus keeping us " genetically younger , " writes michelle roberts at the bbc . but husten cautions that , though the diet has been linked to other health benefits in the past , this study should n't be given too much weight . it appears to be " excellent " and " well-performed , " he writes , but it was an observational study , and as such has limitations—for example , it 's possible that there were already genetic differences between subjects who adhered to the diet and those who did n't .
