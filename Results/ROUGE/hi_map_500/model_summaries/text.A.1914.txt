a woman visiting a nature reserve in wales over the weekend accidentally took home an estimated 20,000 bees . carol howarth , 65 , stopped in haverfordwest to do some shopping on her way home from the reserve when a swarm of bees descended on her car . " i have never seen that many bees in one spot , " local park ranger tom moses tells the guardian . " they were packed in quite tight and covered a couple of square feet . " fearing the bees or a person might get hurt , he called the pembrokeshire beekeepers ' association and watched for three hours as beekeepers gathered the bees in a cardboard box , reports the telegraph . " it 's safe to say i got stung quite a few times , " moses tells the milford mercury . but the bee tale was n't over . by the time howarth had finished her shopping , the issue seemed resolved and she drove home . the next day , however , the swarm returned . howarth called the beekeepers for backup and the bees were cleared away for a second , and , so far , final , time . the leading theory is that the insects were only following their queen , who may have gotten stuck in howarth 's mitsubishi outlander at the nature reserve . " we think the queen had been attracted to something in the car , perhaps something sweet , and had got into a gap on the boot â€™ s wiper blade or perhaps the hinge , " a beekeeper tells metro , though a queen bee was never found . " it is natural for them to follow the queen but it is a strange thing to see and quite surprising to have a car followed for two days . " ( a swarm of stinging bees descended on a mosque . )
