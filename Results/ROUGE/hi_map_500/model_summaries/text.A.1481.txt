another year , another election , and florida still continues to be one of the most influential states in the electoral college . political pundits have paid special attention to this swing state after its unique role in determining the winner of the 2000 election , and the story is n't any different this cycle . polling and statistics site fivethirtyeight—which correctly predicted the entire electoral college map in 2012—estimates florida is the most likely " tipping point " state for the 2016 election . currently , hillary clinton holds a 1-point lead in florida . florida 's large allotment of 29 electoral votes means clinton could afford to lose several other states if she was able to hold on to florida . trump , data shows , does not have that luxury . the businessman needs florida to put together any sort of plausible electoral win—at least according to current polls . trump has made no secret that he does n't trust the polls , and according to the ap , neither do his supporters . so at least in trump-land , there may be more paths to victory that do n't include florida . but for now , experts say trump and his campaign should be spending a lot of time down south in the sun . read fivethirtyeight 's full post here .
