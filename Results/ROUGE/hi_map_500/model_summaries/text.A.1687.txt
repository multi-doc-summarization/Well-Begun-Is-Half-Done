saxby chambliss will announce today that he does n't intend to run for re-election when his senate term ends in 2014 , sources tell the atlanta journal-constitution . chambliss reportedly told his senior staff about the decision this morning . chambliss was considered one of the republicans most ripe for a primary challenge , the washington post observes , thanks to his track record of bipartisan compromise and recent break with grover norquist . potential successors are sure to come out of the woodwork now . two house members , paul broun and tom price , had already been considering primary challenges , and more , including phil gingrey and tom graves , are likely to consider throwing their hats in now . but there are also some bigger name possibilities : a recent poll , for instance , shows that herman cain would have trounced chambliss in a primary , meaning he would be an early favorite if he decided to run .
