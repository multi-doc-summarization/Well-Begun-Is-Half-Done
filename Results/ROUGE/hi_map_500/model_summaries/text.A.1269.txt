if you 're a commoner who wants to get queen elizabeth ii 's attention , apparently it is possible , but it will take decades of work . in a touching facebook post pointed out by mashable , andrew simes writes that his grandfather had always made it a point to send a christmas card to his king or queen . elizabeth had been getting the cards since 1952 , and happened to meet simes ' grandpa at a reception in turkey in 1972—whereupon she told him , " so it 's you who keeps sending me those lovely christmas cards , " simes says . the queen later sent a note on simes ' grandpa 's 100th birthday . the older man died at age 102 in 2011 , and simes took over sending the christmas cards that year—which is where the story gets really poignant . in january 2012 , simes got a letter from buckingham palace . " in it was written : 'when i received a letter from a different simes this christmas , i instructed my office to research your grandfather 's whereabouts . therefore it is with much sadness , i have learned of his passing and extend my condolences to you and your family , ' " simes writes . " i could n't fight back the tears then , nor can i fight them back every time i remember this story of two people who left a lifelong impression on each other . " he 's still sending her majesty the annual holiday greeting ; see an image here .
