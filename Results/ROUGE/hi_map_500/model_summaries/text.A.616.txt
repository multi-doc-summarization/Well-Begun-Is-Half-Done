the secret service prostitution scandal dominated the talk show air waves today , with a pair of female legislators openly questioning whether more women in the elite guards ' ranks could 've averted the scandal . " it defies belief that this is just an aberration , " sen. susan collins told this week . " i ca n't help but wonder if there 'd been more women as part of that detail if this ever would ’ ve happened . " where are the women ? " concurred rep. carolyn maloney , noting that only 11 % are female . " we probably need to diversify the secret service . " elsewhere on your sunday dial , as per politico : tom coburn on the scandal : " you know , i 'm not critical of what the administration has done thus far . i think what we 're seeing is an aberration . " marco rubio on the vp selection process : " it 'd be wise for all republicans to respect that process , myself included , and say moving forward , we 're going to let his process play itself out . he 's been a great decision maker throughout his career in both the private sector and in politics and he 's going to make a great choice . " as for his pick ? " i hope ( jeb bush ) will say yes if future president romney asks him . " david axelrod on president obama 's reaction to the gsa scandal : " he was , i think it ’ s fair to say , apoplectic . we made a big effort to cut waste , inefficiency , fraud , saved tens of billions of dollars on just this very kind of thing . and so this was very enraging to him , and , of course , he acted quickly , and changed the management there . " joe lieberman on election 2012 : " i 'm going to try something different this year . i 'm going to try to stay out of this one . i 'm enjoying not being involved in the nastiness of campaigning in america these days .
