fred phelps and members of his westboro baptist church were ignored when they filmed themselves burning a koran in 2008 , but terry jones managed to grab headlines worldwide . the florida pastor , the new york times finds , managed to make himself a major news story by exploiting the " ground zero mosque " debate , the summer lull in news , and by giving more than 150 interviews in july and august as the story snowballed . news outlets including fox , the ap , and cnn now stress that if jones goes ahead with the burning tomorrow—which he says has been suspended—they wo n't be showing any images of burning korans . if he does n't proceed tomorrow , but threatens to revive international burn a koran day in the future , richard adams writes at the guardian , " he 'll be handled with much more caution by the us media , which has made itself look ridiculous in being outfoxed by the crackpot pastor of a miniscule church in the swamp .
