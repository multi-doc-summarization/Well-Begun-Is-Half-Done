a genetic study has found a new and dangerous possibility lurking in the dna of florida 's invasive pythons . per the miami herald , researchers from the us geological survey tested hundreds of the everglades ' already worryingly prolific giant snake species and what they found could mean an even hardier invader down the line . where they expected to find nothing but dna from the water-loving ancestors of carelessly released pet burmese pythons , scientists discovered that at least 13 of 400 snakes tested showed signs of hybridization with a relative known as the indian rock python . unlike the burmese , the rock python prefers to live on higher drier ground . it 's also faster and smaller . per the guardian , this tells researchers that floating somewhere in the gene pool of florida 's estimated 150,000 pythons could be a mix of genes that could lead to a " super snake " with the ability to adapt even better to subtropical conditions in a florida ecosystem already overrun with exotic and damaging invasives . because researchers ca n't tell from their 400 snakes exactly how many of the sunshine state 's pythons are hybrids , they ca n't say for sure whether the added indian rock python traits could one day make the population more adaptable to larger swaths of florida and beyond .
