saturn 's moon titan , which happens to be larger than the planet mercury , is cold . very cold . as in -290 degrees fahrenheit is not out of the ordinary . these super low temps , combined with an atmosphere roughly 1.5 times as dense as earth 's , have resulted in a few extraordinary bodies of liquid methane and ethane , reports extreme tech , and scientists are anxious to explore their depths . ( in fact , titan is the only body aside from earth to boast liquid lakes on its surface . ) so nasa is working up a ( very early ) model of a submarine drone that could do just thatâ€”one that cnet reports will likely be nuclear-powered , weigh a ton , and come equipped with a seafloor camera , sampling system , and other fancy futuristic robotic accoutrements . but do n't get too excited just yet . first , this is a fully automated mission : " even if it were possible for humans to go swimming in titan 's seas , " notes cnet , it " would be something like swimming in a freezing ocean of liquefied natural gas . " hence , nasa 's goal of sending the " highly capable science craft " to titan 's largest sea , kraken mare , around the year 2040 , in what it calls " an unprecedented planetary exploration mission . " many details remain to be sorted out , including how to get the craft to titan ( boeing 's x-37 is a possibility ) , how to land it ( parachute drop ) , and while there , how to communicate with earthlings ( planar phased-array antenna ) . ( something else on titan has been stumping nasa . )
