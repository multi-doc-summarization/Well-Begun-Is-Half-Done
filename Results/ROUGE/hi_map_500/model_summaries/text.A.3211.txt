the case of the renoir supposedly purchased at a flea market for $ 7 in 2009 continues to unspool dramatically : now the washington post finds three witnesses who say on the shore of the seine hung in marcia fouquet 's virginia home in the 1980s and 1990s . that would seem to dispute the story fouquet 's daughter , martha ( or marcia , depending on which article you 're reading ) fuqua , has given about her lucky find . the painting was discovered to have been stolen from a baltimore museum in 1951 , and now fuqua is fighting to hold onto it . robert musser , who dated and lived with fouquet in the 1980s , recalls the small , ornately-framed painting adorned with renoir 's name on a small plaque attached to the frame . " she said it came from a museum in baltimore , " he says . " she said it was a real renoir , that she owned a renoir . ... she never told me how she acquired it . " he assumed it was a fake . an anonymous childhood friend of fuqua 's says the mother and daughter showed her the painting in fouquet 's studio in the 1990s and said it was a real renoir . " i did n't ask where it came from because i just assumed they were lying , " she says , but the " unusual " frame and renoir plaque stuck in her memory . bobby j. fontaine , a former student of fouquet 's who lived with the family for a time , also remembered fouquet showing him the painting in the 1990s . " she says , 'do you think it ’ s real or not ? ' " he recalls . " i told her , ' i guess it ’ s real . ' " but they spoke no more about it . this follows last month 's news that a few months before fuqua claimed to have found the renoir at a flea market , she took it to be appraised at an auction house—where she reportedly told an art specialist that she had gotten it from an estate .
