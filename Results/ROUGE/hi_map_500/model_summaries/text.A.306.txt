matt mccarthy , a hollywood dj , photographer , and model , is suing josh duggar for damages , claiming the scandal-plagued reality star used mccarthy 's photo for his online profiles , courthouse news service reports . tmz says those profiles included one on cheating site ashley madison , and that duggar is also accused of using mccarthy 's image on twitter and okcupid . mccarthy says he 's been humiliated by the scandal and that people are calling him " dj duggar " and " duggar 's boy toy . " tmz reported last year that duggar apparently found mccarthy 's picture by googling " random guy . " at that time , mccarthy said he 'd already lost a dj gig over the perception that he was somehow involved in duggar 's porn-and-sex scandal . the hollywood reporter and gawker also delved into the issue last year , reporting that mccarthy 's photo appeared on an okcupid profile apparently set up by duggar and seeking " casual sex , " in addition to the ashley madison profile . back in the present day , tmz notes that duggar is reportedly working at a car dealership now that he 's no longer on reality tv .
