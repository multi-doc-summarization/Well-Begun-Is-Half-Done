now that the justice department has decided not to file criminal charges in the irs scandal over the scrutiny of conservative groups , house republicans have moved to take action of their own : impeachment . a powerful house committee has advanced a measure to impeach irs chief john koskinen , reports the washington post . koskinen took over after the scandal broke , but republicans say he lied to congress in the subsequent investigation . " commissioner koskinen violated the public trust , " says rep. jason chaffetz , chair of the house oversight and government reform panel . " he failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena , documents were destroyed on his watch , and the public was consistently misled . " at issue are 422 backup tapes that might have contained emails from the irs figure at the center of the scandal , lois lerner , explains the hill . koskinen not only failed to preserve them , he did n't notify congress they were missing , says chaffetz . democrats say it 's all political theater . " calling this resolution a ‘ stunt ’ or a ‘ joke ’ would be insulting to stunts and jokes , " says elijah cummings . still , the long-shot bid now moves on to the house judiciary committee .
