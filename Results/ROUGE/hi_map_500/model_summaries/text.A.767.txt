an estimated 8 % to 13 % of pregnant woman are on antidepressants , and not without warning : the fda in 2005 amended antidepressants ' labels to indicate that babies born to moms taking them could suffer an increased risk of heart defects . but causation had n't been proven , and the latest study on the topic indicates those warnings may be baseless . the latest study , published in the new england journal of medicine , followed 949,504 pregnant women , 64,389 ( 6.8 % ) of whom used antidepressants during the first trimesterâ€”the period of the most rapid cell division , when the risk of developing such defects is highest , webmd explains . what krista huybrechts of brigham and women 's hospital did differently : she and her team took into consideration factors that could lead to heart defects , like the mother 's age and whether she had diabetes . the boston herald reports that among babies whose mothers did not take antidepressants , 72.3 per 10,000 were born with a cardiac defect , compared with 90.1 per 10,000 infants whose mothers did . after controlling for risk factors , " there is no evidence to support a substantial increased risk of cardiac malformations overall , " says huybrechts . still , she cautions that antidepressant use during pregnancy poses a " whole range of other potential adverse outcomes . " to wit , one expert pointed to " serious flaws " with the study . for one , it did n't flag miscarriages , which are linked to antidepressants . " it may be that the most severely affected pregnancies are miscarrying , " he noted .
