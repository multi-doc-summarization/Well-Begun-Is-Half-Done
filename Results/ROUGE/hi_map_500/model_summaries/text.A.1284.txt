here 's a sign that your disquisition on race did n't go very well : you wind up apologizing to trayvon martin 's family . that 's the position mark cuban found himself in yesterday , after a perhaps-too-candid talk at inc. magazine 's growco conference the day prior . asked about the donald sterling controversy , the dallas mavericks owner said he was worried about being a hypocrite . the money quote , which he said in roughly these terms at the conference and reiterated in this video interview with inc. : " i know i 'm bigoted in a lot of different ways . if i see a black kid in a hoodie and it 's late at night , i 'm walking to the other side of the street . and if on that side of the street , there 's a guy that has tattoos all over his face—white guy , bald head , tattoos everywhere—i 'm walking back to the other side of the street . " " i 'm a bigot , " cuban said at the conference . " i think we 're all bigots . " then he predicted , " i 'm sure that 'll be all over the place , " and , lo , that prophesy came true . critics and supporters have been vigorously decrying and defending cuban 's remarks ( there 's a good sample at the dallas morning news ) . many , including espn commentator bomani jones and cnn commentator lz granderson , jumped on cuban for making a false equivalency between black men in hoodies and white men with tattoos . " one has history and the other does n't , or the same sort of emotional response , " granderson said . later cuban conceded that point at least , in a series of tweets : " in hindsight i should have used different examples . i did n't consider the trayvon martin family , and i apologize to them for that . beyond apologizing to the martin family , i stand by the words and substance of the interview .
