the disagreement with the us currently devastating the turkish economy does n't appear likely to end anytime soon . american pastor andrew brunson , who was jailed by turkey for almost two years before a shift to house arrest last month , is at the center of the dispute and a senior white house official tells the wall street journal that the us has rejected a turkish offer to trade his freedom for dropping charges against halkbank , a state-owned bank facing billions in us fines for violating sanctions on iran . the us has told turkey it wo n't negotiate until brunson , who faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted , is freed , the white house official says , adding : " a real nato ally wouldn â€™ t have arrested brunson in the first place . " the us has already hit turkish officials with sanctions over brunson and the two countries have traded tariff increases , causing the turkish lira to plummet to record lows . brunson , a pastor from north carolina strongly supported by american evangelical groups , was arrested because of his alleged ties to banned political groups , the bbc reports . american officials have threatened even more sanctions unless brunson is freed , while turkey has said it will not give in to american threats . jon alterman at the center for strategic and international studies describes brunson as a " pawn " in a feud between president trump and turkey 's president recep tayyip erdogan . ( shots were fired at the us embassy in ankara early monday . )
