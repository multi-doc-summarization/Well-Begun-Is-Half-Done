a government backed by russia is accused of killing its own civilians . that applies not only to the current situation in syria but to the 1999 situation in kosovo . and as the new york times reports , top us officials are keeping kosovo very much in mind as they weigh their options . president obama would likely never get the approval of the un security council for a military response because of russia 's veto power . when bill clinton was in the same boat in 1999 , he turned to nato and got its blessing for 78 days of airstrikes . “ it ’ s a step too far to say we ’ re drawing up legal justifications for an action , given that the president hasn ’ t made a decision , ” a government official tells the times . “ but kosovo , of course , is a precedent of something that is perhaps similar. ” obama was meeting today with national security aides to determine next steps if the us concludes that bashar al-assad used chemical weapons . ( assad in turn accused the rebels of doing the same today . ) meanwhile , the us navy is keeping two destroyers positioned in the mediterranean in case the green light is given for a cruise-missile attack , reports the wall street journal .
