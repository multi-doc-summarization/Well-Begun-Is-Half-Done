it 's a predictable cycle : a hunter posts a photo of themselves beaming over the carcass of a fresh kill only to become the target of international condemnation ( like this , this , and this , to recall a few ) . this time , the ire-inducing image shows american larysa switlyk , host of larysa unleashed on the wild television network , posing with a goat she 'd just shot on scotland 's island of islay , the new york times reports . " such a fun hunt ! ! , " switlyk writes in the twitter post . " hunted hard for a big one for 2 days . " additional photos posted to switlyk 's twitter account show hunters posing with other dead animals . sarah moyes , spokeswoman for animal advocacy group onekind calls the photos " utterly shocking , " saying , " this is not the kind of tourism we should be encouraging in scotland , let alone allowing to happen in the 21st century . " some commenters on social media are more blunt about their displeasure , including " so basically you enjoy killing things ? scary but sad . " others are speaking up to support switlyk , with one saying , " what ’ s the problem with going and hunting a goat … and using all parts of the goat , it 's quite beautiful . " still others say that hunts are an important part of keeping animal populations in check . scottish first minister nicola sturgeon and environment secretary roseanna cunningham both acknowledge that the images may be disturbing , but say that hunting wild animals is not illegal , abc reports , with cunningham saying she will review the laws . as for switlyk , she posted on instagram that she 's heading back into the wild for two weeks , " hopefully that will give enough time for all the ignorant people sending me death threats to get educated on hunting and conservation .
