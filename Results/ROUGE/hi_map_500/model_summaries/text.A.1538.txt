greek astronomer hipparchus is known as the father of trigonometry . but the guardian reports babylonian mathematicians may have gotten there 1,000 years earlier . ever since the real-life inspiration for indiana jones discovered a 3,700-year-old clay tablet called p322 in what is now iraq , historians and mathematicians have debated the meaning of the rows and columns of numbers on it , according to science . in 1945 , mathematicians realized those numbers contained the pythagorean theorem for deducing the sides of a right triangle a millennium before pythagoras had coined it , abc reports . and in a study published thursday in historia mathematica , australian researchers believe they finally know what those mysterious numbers are : a trigonometric table more accurate than any we have now . “ it took me two years of looking at this and saying , ‘ i ’ m sure it ’ s trig , i ’ m sure it ’ s trig , but how ? ’ ” mathematician daniel mansfield tells science . one breakthrough came when mansfield realized the babylonians had a completely different way of looking at trigonometry than we do , one " based on ratios , not angles and circles . " he calls it " fascinating " and evidence of " undoubted genius . " and fellow researchers norman wildberger says p322 represents a " simpler , more accurate " version of trigonometry . while mansfield and wildberger say the babylonians could have used the tablet to build pyramids and palaces , critics say there 's no evidence for that and call the study 's conclusions " highly speculative . " ( those fortune cookie " lucky numbers " are definitely not unlucky . )
