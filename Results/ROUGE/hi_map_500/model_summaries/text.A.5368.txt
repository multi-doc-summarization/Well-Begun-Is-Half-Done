what 's harder to watch : an adult human kicking a puppy or an adult human kicking another adult human ? science says : the puppy . a new study has found abused dogs—both puppies and grown-ups—elicit more sympathy than abused adult humans . abused human kids , however , are equally sympathetic as abused dogs , livescience reports . " the fact that adult human crime victims receive less empathy than do child , puppy , and full grown dog victims suggests that adult dogs are regarded as dependent and vulnerable not unlike their younger canine counterparts and kids , " says one of the study 's researchers . the researchers at northeastern university in boston showed 240 students one of four news articles about a beating—each article was the same except for the victim , which was variously an infant , a puppy , a man in his 30s , or a 6-year-old dog . " we were surprised by the interaction of age and species , " says a co-author of the study , per science daily . " age seems to trump species , when it comes to eliciting empathy . in addition , it appears that adult humans are viewed as capable of protecting themselves while full grown dogs are just seen as larger puppies .
