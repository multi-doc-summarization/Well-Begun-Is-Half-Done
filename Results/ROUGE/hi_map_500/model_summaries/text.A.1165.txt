new york city opened an old time capsule today that turned out to be ... kind of boring . boston , on the other hand , has itself a mysterious red book , reports wbur . historians today removed a copper box that was placed inside the lion atop the old state house back in 1901 and were surprised to find the hard-cover book on top , apparently in great condition . the curious will have to wait a little longer , however , because officials did n't open the book or anything beneath it inside the boxâ€”they 'll do that later in a controlled environment to make sure nothing gets ruined . expect old photos , letters , newspapers , and similar memorabilia . but as for the book , no mention of it was made in a newspaper article of the time about the time capsule . an official with the bostonian society guesses that it might be a family history of a carpenter named samuel rogers , reports the boston globe . rogers worked on the building and helped prepare the time capsule , notes a separate globe story . and while he did reportedly pop a family history inside , there 's no account of it being in a red book . eventually , all the items will go on public display , and a new time capsule will go back inside the lion . one thing for sure that will be included : a medal from the 2013 boston marathon , the one hit by bombs , reports ap .
