nestle extracted roughly 32 million gallons of water from southern california 's san bernardino national forest in 2016 and sold it as arrowhead bottled water . an investigation has determined the company 's permits only allow it to take about 8.5 million gallons per year . the ap reports the news is being hailed by opponents to nestle 's action—and by nestle . the company reportedly described itself as pleased that the state water resources control board 's report confirms it has the right to access " a significant amount " of water . " we will continue to operate lawfully according to these existing rights and will comply fully with california law , " nestle said in a statement . the longer view is n't quite as favorable sounding : npr reports that between 1947 and 2015 , nestle extracted an average 62.6 million gallons annually , with the rights unchanged at 8.5 million . nestle told the state its claim to the water dates to an 1865 claim held by the owner of the arrowhead springs hotel ; the board found that claim was limited to " riparian " —meaning at the water 's origin—use " and is not valid for nestle ’ s current appropriative diversion and use of water " from the forest . the company was notified of the findings—the result of an investigation begun in 2016 and borne from complaints spurred by the state 's drought—on dec. 20 . a letter accompanying the findings recommended that nestle immediately halt unauthorized distributions and outlined steps it recommends the company take over the next 18 months .
