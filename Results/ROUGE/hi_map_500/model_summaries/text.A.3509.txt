will the third time be the charm for amazon ? its now-slightly-misnomered prime day ( it 's actually 30 hours long , not 24 , this year ) kicks off at 9pm edt monday . its inaugural sale in 2015 did n't blow consumers over ; in 2016 there were early-morning website issues for some customers . this year , amazon is ready , at least by usa today 's account , which notes that two floors of conference rooms at hq have been " outfitted as war rooms " to support the onslaught of shoppers , all of whom must have a prime membership to get the deals . more : the figures : prime day 2016 saw an estimated $ 500 million to $ 600 million in sales ( amazon did n't release official numbers ) . that 's a fraction of the $ 3.34 billion spent on the black friday that followed months later , but amazon said the total was up 60 % over 2015 , with 2017 's prime day expected to be even bigger . what does bigger look like ? beating 2016 prime day records like these perhaps , per techcrunch : more than 90,000 tvs , 1 million shoes , 23,000 irobot vacuums , and 200,000 headphones were sold . it 's a win-win for amazon : there 's a big upside involved in reeling in new prime shoppers ( the count has increased about 20 million year-over-year in the us , to 85 million ) : their amazon spending is almost double that of a non-prime customer : $ 1,300 a year versus $ 700 . what 's on sale ? some 100,000 items , per cnet , but those items do n't all go on sale at once . it offers tips on how to be alerted to the best deals ( one smart one involves using your amazon wish list ) . fortune offers some other ways , including a convenient-sounding alexa tip . so are the deals deals ? in some cases . quartz points out that the wirecutter gadget-review site examined 8,000 deals last prime day and recommended fewer than 1 % of them : 64 . one handy tool : camelcamelcamel.com , which prompts you to input a product url and then lets you know how that stacks up to what amazon has charged for the item in the past . there 's reason to care : ... and also reason to avoid the " rabbit hole " altogether . rick broida makes both cases at cnet . one dose of reality : if you 've enjoyed amazon 's tax-free shopping in the past , it 's , well , a thing of the past . forbes points out that since april 1 , amazon has been levying sales tax for shoppers in all states with a sales tax ( five do n't have one : alaska , delaware , montana , new hampshire , and oregon ) .
