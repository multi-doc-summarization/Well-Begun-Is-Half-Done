major european retailers are lining up to sign a bangladesh safety plan aimed at preventing disasters like rana plaza , but american companies , including the gap and walmart , are backing away . walmart—which blames a " rogue employee " for an order for its clothes found in the rubble of the building collapse—says it has its own safety plan for the 279 factories it uses in bangladesh , and it will quickly deliver results as good as or better than the european plan , the new york times reports . walmart plans to audit factories for safety and remove them from its suppliers list if hazards are found . but while the european plan is legally binding , walmart 's is voluntary , and experts say such plans have a poor record for delivering results . " without the legally binding contract that the european retailers have signed , it 's just putting lipstick on a pig , " a sociology professor who has been a vocal critic of sweatshops tells the wall street journal . the gap , meanwhile , says it wo n't sign the european plan unless language is removed that it fears could make it liable in us courts for safety failures at bangladesh factories . the only american firm to have signed the plan so far is pvh , the parent company of calvin klein and tommy hilfiger .
