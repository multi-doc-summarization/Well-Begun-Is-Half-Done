loyalty between dog and man once again has no bounds , this time via a german shepherd who waited two weeks for an owner who 'd never come home again . the dog was first spotted at an apartment complex near houston 's hobby airport , ktrk reportsâ€”sometimes on the steps , sometimes at the complex 's front gates , sometimes camped out at one particular apartment 's front door . " you could just tell that he was a lost dog , " neighbor cassandra eubanks says . " he would follow the cars and when he would realize that it was not his owner 's car , he would just stand there and look helpless . " what the poor pup did n't realize : his owner , 54-year-old hatem abuharbid , had been killed in a robbery feb. 7 at the convenience store where he worked , abc news reports . " of course he 's confused , because he does n't know what 's going on , " eubanks says . the dog would n't approach neighbors who left food and water out for him , but he was eventually rescued by a woman who had heard about his plight on social media . " it just broke my heart to hear that the poor animal lost his owner , his best friend , " maranda perez tells ktrk . she brought her own dog along and worked patiently for about an hour to make the now-ownerless dog comfortable around her . after following him up three flights of stairs , perez was finally able to place a leash around his neck and get him , with some resistance , into her car . " he was still very shaken up whenever i touched him , " she says . perez says she 'll take care of him for the next week or so before abuharbid 's brother takes the dog in . ( this loyal pooch stuck by its owner 's body until rescuers found them . )
