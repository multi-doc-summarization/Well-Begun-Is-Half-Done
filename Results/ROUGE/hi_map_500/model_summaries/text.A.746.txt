when roberto livar 's wife picked up their son wednesday from great hearts monte vista charter school in san antonio , texas , the 8th-grader was " distraught " over an assignment in history class , livar tells kabb . the worksheet he completed was entitled " the life of slaves : a balanced view , " per wmur , with two empty columns for students to fill in : one labeled " negative aspects , " the other " positive aspects " ( livar 's son crammed all the cons in the former and wrote " n/a " in the latter ) . " what the hell is this revisionist history lesson trying to achieve here ? ! ? , " livar wrote on facebook , with a photo of the worksheet . " what positives ? ? ? this is unacceptable and gross . " among those in agreement : rep. joaquin castro , who tweeted the assignment was " absolutely unacceptable " and noted the teacher was working from a text by publishing giant pearson . pearson , however , says in a statement to newsweek the worksheet did n't come from its book , prentice hall classics : a history of the united states , and that " we ... strongly condemn the implication that there was any positive aspect to slavery . " on facebook , the school addressed the matter , saying the assignment was " very inappropriate and entirely inconsistent with great hearts philosophy and culture . " " to be clear , there is no debate about slavery , " the statement added . " it is immoral and a crime against humanity . " it went on to note that only this particular teacher had used the worksheet , that the teacher has been placed on leave during the fact-gathering process , and that the school would review the text and dump it if it 's found to be " imprudent . " a " follow-up communication " is set for may 9 . ( a new jersey school held a mock slave auction . )
