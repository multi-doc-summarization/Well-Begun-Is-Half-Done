president obama did n't exactly return from the g20 summit with a ringing international endorsement to take action against syria , but he continued making his case before his own nation this morning via his weekly radio address . obama hit familiar themes , ones he will surely revisit in his speech to the nation tuesday night , reports reuters . " this would not be another iraq or afghanistan . " " any action we take would be limited , both in time and scopeâ€”designed to deter the syrian government from gassing its own people again and degrade its ability to do so . " " i know that the american people are weary after a decade of war , even as the war in iraq has ended , and the war in afghanistan is winding down . that 's why we 're not putting our troops in the middle of somebody else 's war . " as for the g20 summit : obama got the backing of 10 countries for a statement that says bashar al-assad should be held accountable for using chemical weapons , but the statement pointedly fell short of calling for military action , notes the los angeles times , which concludes that the president " fell well short of an international coalition that might help persuade reluctant lawmakers . "
