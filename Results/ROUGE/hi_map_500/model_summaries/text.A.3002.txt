the prosecution is laying out its closing arguments in oscar pistorius ' monthslong murder trial today , with the defense expected to wrap things up tomorrow . prosecutor gerrie nel , known as " the pitbull , " began by ripping into pistorius ' claims that he acted in self-defense when shooting reeva steenkamp—who pistorius says he thought was an intruder—and that he was " not criminally responsible " for the shooting because he was " startled , " the ap reports . " it 's two defenses that you can never reconcile , " nel said . pistorius never once said the shooting was an accident because he " intended to kill , " nel said , per the guardian . nel noted that given the lack of imminent attack , pistorius is still guilty of murder even if he did believe steenkamp to be an intruder . nel also drew attention to the contents of steenkamp ’ s stomach , which indicate she ate hours after pistorius said the pair went to bed , and other inconsistencies in the runner 's testimony . " all these lies caught him up , " nel said . he also noted the defense never tried to disprove the claim that a neighbor heard a woman 's raised voice an hour before the gunshots . as to the defense 's claim that pistorius ' screams sound like a woman 's , nel said there is a recording of pistorius screaming but the defense did n't present it because it does n't support their version of events . judge thokozile masipa will likely inform the court tomorrow of when her decision can be expected .
