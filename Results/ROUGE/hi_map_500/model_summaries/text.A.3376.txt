just over a week after the murder of 17 people at marjory stoneman douglas high school , florida gov . rick scott unveiled a plan friday to keep his state 's students safer : a $ 500 million proposal to ban bump stocks , restrict people under age 21 from purchasing guns , and prohibit the " violent or mentally ill " from buying weapons , nbc news reports . " i want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who is a danger to themselves or others to use a gun , " scott said , per the new york times . the age restriction would mark scott 's first big rebuff of nra policy , per the washington post . " i 'm an nra member ( and ) a supporter of the second amendment , " scott said . " i 'm also a father and a grandfather and a governor . we all have a difficult task in front of us balancing our individual rights with our obvious need for public safety . " among the initiatives included in scott 's plan are revamping building security to include metal detectors , better locks , and bulletproof glass ; placing a " law enforcement officer in every public school " ; and working more on " mental health initiatives . " what scott is n't pushing for : banning the ar-15 rifle , which was the type of weapon used in the shooting , and arming teachers , as president trump and others have called for ( to much criticism ) in recent days . " banning specific weapons â€¦ is not going to fix this , " scott said . he also said he 'd rather see " well-trained " members of law enforcement brought in to protect schools than hand weapons to educators . " we must take care of our kids , " he said , per cnn . on wednesday , the nra said it will fight any attempt to raise age limits , saying that move would " [ punish ] law-abiding citizens for the evil acts of criminals .
