dozens of rescuers have made their way to the mountainous area where an indonesian passenger plane crashed on sunday , but they have n't found anybody to rescue . officials say all 54 people on board—44 adult passengers , five children , and five crew members—were killed when the trigana air service atr 42-300 crashed in papua province , reuters reports . " the plane was totally destroyed and all the bodies were burned and difficult to identify , " indonesia 's top search and rescue official tells the ap . he says all 54 bodies have been recovered , along with the plane 's black boxes , which are in good condition . the turboprop plane crashed into the mountain around 30 minutes into a 42-minute flight without making a distress call , cnn reports . the cause of the crash has n't been determined , though officials believe the rugged terrain may have played a role . " there 's a possibility the aircraft hit a peak and then fell into a ravine because the place that it was found is steep , " a search and rescue official tells reuters , which notes that trigana has a very patchy safety record , with 14 serious incidents since it started flying in 1991 , including 10 in which the aircraft was destroyed . the plane was also carrying $ 468,750 in cash , which was to be distributed to poor families .
