john roberts upheld the affordable care act today , and " in doing so , he gave a lot of people who do n't pay attention a reason to celebrate him on twitter , " writes mobutu sese seko of gawker . " they 're idiots . " seko and some other observers believe roberts had a secret plan . yes , his ruling hands obama a superficial victory , but that " was , ultimately , a pretext , " writes tom scocca of slate . his real goal : to gut the commerce clause , and fundamentally cripple congress ' ability to regulate . roberts ruled that the victory was a result of congress ' power to tax , not the commerce clause . in so doing he 's rolling back long-held precedent , and severely curtailing congress ' power . " it is what roberts has been pursuing ever since he signed up with the federalist society , " scocca writes . " roberts ' genius was in pushing this through without attaching it to the coattails of an ugly , narrow partisan victory . " seko also notes that by using the tax power , he 's " handed the republican party a talking point . " the aca is now , officially , a tax .
