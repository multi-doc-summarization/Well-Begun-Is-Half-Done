it 's probably been a hot summer where you are , but nothing like this : california 's death valley registered an average temperature of 107.4 degrees for the month of july , per the national weather service . the previous record , set in 1917 , was 107.2 degrees . it 's not only a record for death valley : " it should be noted that this is the hottest average monthly temperature ever measured in the us , or , for that matter , anywhere in the western hemisphere , " a climatologist tells the washington post . if 107.4 does n't seem insanely high , keep in mind that was the average temperature of both days and nights , notes the los angeles times . during the day , it typically got up to 120 degrees before cooling down to about 95 at night . the hottest day came on july 7 , which saw a temperature of 127 . fortunately , few people were affected : as usa today notes , death valley is a national park with no permanent residents save for park rangers .
