cnn is taking heat after a host assumed a teen spelling bee champ of indian descent was " used to using " sanskrit . the washington post reports the exchange occurred on the network 's " new day " program following 12-year-old ananya vinay 's victory at thursday night 's 90th annual scripps howard spelling bee . after asking ananya to spell " covfefe , " hosts alisyn camerota and chris cuomo joked that president trump 's " nonsense word " has dubious origins . " we ’ re not sure that its root is actually in sanskrit , which is what you ’ re probably , uh , used to using , " camerota told ananya , who was born and raised in fresno , calif . criticism that camerota 's quip was insensitive and " racist " swept social media . " if she were jewish would you say 'your real language is hebrew ? ' " one woman tweeted . " are you serious @ cnn ? " tweeted another . " that 's some straight racism there . " sandip roy writes in huffington post india that while " there 's nothing wrong with ananya vinay being used to " the ancient language of the hindu scriptures , " the presumption that ( ananya ) must be familiar with her sanskrit just reeks of the assumption that she is still more indian than american . " he compares it to camerota being asked if " she was probably used to latin . " cnn dismissed the dust-up , per huffpo , calling the segment " fun and innocent " and noting that camerota was following up an earlier joke about " covfefe 's " roots . " if she 's guilty of anything it 's recycling a joke , " the network said . ( ananya nailed her bee win with this word . meanwhile , americans find these words vexing . )
