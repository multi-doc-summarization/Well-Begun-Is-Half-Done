we can thank thomas edison for plenty of things , but the world had little use for one of his inventions . edison 's talking dolls were among the first of their kind , npr reports . but even in the 1890s , they scared kids—and were expensive—and only about 500 of them were built and sold . ( edison reportedly later referred to the failed dolls as " little monsters . " ) some still exist , but they 've been silent for years . robin and joan rolfs , owners of two dolls , feared that operating the cranks on their backs could break them , the new york times reports . their voices came from recordings on wax cylinders , but if a doll 's phonograph needle hit the cylinder again today , it could ruin it . the good news , at least for fans of extremely creepy 19th-century recordings , is that we can finally hear them again . that 's thanks to the work of a physicist and an engineer , who developed a technology that uses a microscope to study the grooves on the cylinders before they are re-created as computer images and , ultimately , extremely accurate sounds . the cylinders do n't have to be touched at all , the times notes . " we are now hearing sounds from history that i did not expect to hear in my lifetime , " the curator of the thomas edison national historical park tells the paper . the recordings feature what are supposed to be the voices of little girls reading nursery rhymes . but the curator tells npr that they more likely contain recordings of factory workers mimicking little kids . " edison himself thought they were unpleasant , " he notes . pbs newshour calls them " nightmare fuel . " ( but is it enough to knock edison off the list of the 10 most popular americans ? )
