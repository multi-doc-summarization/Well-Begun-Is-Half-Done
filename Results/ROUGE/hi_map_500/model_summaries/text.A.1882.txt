in moammar gadhafi 's libya , the only protesters are a few al-qaeda-backed , drug-addled libyans , the rest of his people love him , and he in fact ca n't step down—and certainly has no intention of doing so . the libyan leader sat down with abc 's christiane amanpour and the bbc 's jeremy bowen for an hour-long interview today . some highlights : " they love me . all my people with me , they love me , " he said . " they will die to protect me , my people . " for world leaders who accuse him of hiding assets abroad , gadhafi says he 'll " put two fingers in their eye . " gadhafi strongly denies that government forces have used violence against libyans , insisting that government airstrikes destroyed only barracks and ammunition depots . he insists that he can not step down , as he has no formal position—gadhafi says that the will of the people , alone , keeps him in power . given his al-qaeda theory , gadhafi is taken aback by the us support for the demonstrators . " i 'm surprised that we have an alliance with the west to fight al-qaeda , and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us , " he said . " perhaps they want to occupy libya . " us ambassador to the un susan rice said in response that the interview proves gadhafi is " delusional . " " when he can laugh in talking to american and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality .
