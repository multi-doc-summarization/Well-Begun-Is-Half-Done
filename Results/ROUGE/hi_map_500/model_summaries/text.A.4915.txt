thanks to a dedicated grandson , illinois man walter thomas finally has an answer to a question that he has pondered for many of his 91 years . he " told me a long time ago that he always wanted to back a car through the garage door , " granddaughter becky goers tells the woodstock independent . " he always wondered if the garage door would pop off , or if the frame would come down with it . " after hearing about the bizarre " bucket list " item , goers ' brother—an accident reconstruction officer for the county sheriff 's office—set to work making it happen , obtaining an old car and finding friends who were about to demolish a garage , the independent reports . last sunday , as family members that included great-grandchildren and his wife of 70 years looked on , thomas put on a crash helmet and backed right through the wooden garage door with his grandson sitting in the passenger seat , reports the independent , which notes that while the door was smashed , the frame stayed up . " i hit the gas , squealed the tires , and bang—we went through the door , " a satisfied thomas tells the ap . it 's not clear whether there are any items left on his bucket list , but he says taking down that garage door will be hard to top . ( a new york city man took his dying dog on an epic " bucket list " road trip . )
