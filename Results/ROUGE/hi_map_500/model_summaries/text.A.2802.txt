a clinic run by michele bachmann 's therapist husband has collected $ 137,000 in payments from a program lashed by the gop presidential candidate : medicaid . those payments are on top of an additional $ 30,000 in government grant money for employee training at marcus bachmann 's clinic . the clinic , which advertises " quality christian counseling " for a range of mental health issues , also participates in a state subsidized health insurance program , notes msnbc . revelation of the health care payments—in addition to some $ 260,000 in subsidies for a wisconsin farm owned in part by the bachmanns—is proving an embarrassment to the tea party candidate who rips such " big government " aid on the campaign stump . when minnesota 's governor signed a law earlier this month expanding medicaid coverage to more state residents , bachmann railed that " even more welfare recipients " would be added to the " welfare rolls at a very great cost . " she 's " giving hypocrisy a bad name , " says the executive director of health care advocacy organization families usa . " it 's clear when it feathers her nest she 's happy for medicaid expenditures . but people that really need it—folks with disabilities and seniors—she 's turning their backs on them . " bachmann was not immediately available for comment , but has insisted neither she nor her husband have personally benefited from government subsidies going to the clinic or family farm .
