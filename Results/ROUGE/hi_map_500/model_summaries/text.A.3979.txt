" according to the los angeles times , barton 's suit says she entered into a verbal contract with her mom when she was 8 ; her mom was to get 10 % of her gross earnings . in 2006 , when barton was 20 , she claims her mother convinced her to buy a $ 7.8 million home in beverly hills as an investment vehicle ... but that nuala and barton 's dad now live in the home , where barton is " not welcome . " there are myriad additional accusations surrounding forged signatures , a handbag line , a fashion boutique , and endorsement contracts , along with allegations of " bullying and verbal abuse .
