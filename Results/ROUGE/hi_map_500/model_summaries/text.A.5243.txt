if this story did n't already cause you to develop a mild case of gephyrophobia , then this one may do the trick : some 11 % of america 's bridges are structurally deficient and in need of repair , according to a new report from transportation for america . it 's a stat made more serious when you consider this next one : 260 million trips are made across the 66,405 problematic bridges each day . as usa today explains , these bridges are n't necessarily dangerous , they just need a lot of work , which has been priced at $ 76 billion by the federal highway administration . that amount will just get larger as the years pass . these bridges are , on average , 65 years old , and in 10 years , the number of " senior citizen " bridges will be one in four . " you 're seeing the aging of the system , " says a co-author of the report . " it really does parallel the [ aging of ] the baby boomers in a startling way . " congress recently eliminated a dedicated bridge repair fund , meaning " bridge repair now must compete with other transportation needs , " the report states . rather than " an epidemic of collapses , " the more common consequences of the aging bridge system will be things like more large potholes and closed lanes , the co-author tells nbc news .
