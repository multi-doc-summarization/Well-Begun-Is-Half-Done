the obama administration will soon take the radical step of allowing legal pot businesses to actually put their money in banks—sort of . at an event yesterday , eric holder said he was working with the treasury department on new regulations and would unveil them " very soon , " politico reports . " there 's a public safety component to this , " the attorney general explained . " substantial amounts of cash just kind of lying around ... is something that would worry me , just from a law enforcement perspective . " but a justice department spokesperson later said that it would merely issue legal " guidance " telling prosecutors not to prioritize such cases . that might not be enough for banks ; the american bankers association tell the new york times that they 'll want " a lot of detail from regulators " —and assurances they wo n't be prosecuted—before they 'll feel comfortable taking the money . states with legalized marijuana have been clamoring for such a change , as have the companies themselves , who say they 're overburdened with cash . but the times notes it 's unclear whether what the doj is preparing would extend to all states that have oked medical marijuana , or just colorado and washington . it would be a rare pro-pot step from what 's been a virulently anti-pot administration , and comes on the heels of president obama 's recent much-discussed comments on it .
