texas women came forward earlier this month to tell their miscarriage and abortion stories to fend off proposed new funerary rules for embryonic and fetal tissue , but sharing their experiences apparently fell short of the mark . per state health officials , starting dec. 19 , hospitals , abortion clinics , and other facilities will be banned from disposing of fetal remains in sanitary landfills , the texas tribune reports . instead , they 'll be required to bury or cremate the remains , no matter the gestational ageâ€”a move spurring " intense outcry " from reproductive rights advocates , as well as from medical providers . " the state [ health and human services commission ] has once again ignored the concerns of the medical community and thousands of texans by playing politics with people 's private health-care decisions , " heather busby , director of naral pro-choice texas , says in a statement . but health officials say they 've addressed the major concerns brought up during what the washington post calls " months of controversy " since the initial july proposal . in terms of privacy , birth or death certificates are n't required , and miscarriages or abortions at home do n't have to comply . as for the costs , the medical care facilities will pay , with costs " offset by the elimination of some current methods of disposition , " per the health department . the commission notes the rules will lead to " enhanced protection of the health and safety of the public , " but women 's rights advocates say it 's nothing more than a veiled attempt to restrict abortion access , per the dallas morning news . " these new restrictions reveal the callous indifference that texas politicians have toward women , " a center for reproductive rights lawyer says , adding the rules will " almost certainly trigger costly litigation , " per the tribune .
