if the words " pole vaulting " do n't inspire fear in you , they should . that 's the upshot of a vice article about the sport , which succinctly expresses why : " at 20 feet , a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house , while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands . " if that sounds like a brush with death , it quite literally can be : a 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the national center for catastrophic sports injury research between 1982 and 1998 ; half the accidents resulted in death , and 6 in permanent disabilities . a follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad 's minimum dimensions . in the 8 years that followed , the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal . but the rest were n't pretty : major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them . and a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last january found 41 % sustained some kind of injury , a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that " injuries are very common in experienced vaulters . " the injury stats are n't good , and the potential pay and fame are n't much better . so why the heck do it ? vice talked to us record-holder brad walker ( one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters ) , who sums up vaulters as " risk-takers , usually with something to prove to themselves ... you wo n't find a vaulter jumping high who does n't have at least one screw loose . " as for why they stay with it , vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature : as you approach the box you 're a sprinter ; then you 're a gymnast . walker says you need " significant body control and spatial awareness , " too .
