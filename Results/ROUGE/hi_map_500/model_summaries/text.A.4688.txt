unusually for an israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu has had to clarify his position on who he thinks caused the holocaust . in a facebook post , netanyahu backtracked from earlier remarks suggesting the extermination of european jews was a palestinian 's idea , reports i24 . " the decision to move from a policy of deporting jews to the final solution was made by the nazis and was not dependent on outside influence , " said netanyahu , though he stressed that grand mufti of jerusalem haj amin al-husseini supported the holocaust and collaborated with the nazis . " my remarks were intended to illustrate the murderous approach of the mufti to the jews in his lengthy contacts with the nazi leadership , " netanyahu wrote . " the interpretation of my remarks as though i absolved the nazis of even one ounce of responsibility for the holocaust is absurd . " the israeli leader 's oct. 20 remarks were widely condemned by historians and the new york times finds it odd that he waited until friday afternoon , when the controversy had almost completely died down , to clarify them . ( netanyahu 's remarks caused germany to issue a statement saying the holocaust was indeed hitler 's fault . )
