if you think it takes a liter of water to fill a liter water bottle , the international bottled water association has news for you : it takes more than that . npr reports on the group 's first look at the topic , which found that 1.39 liters ( or 47 ounces ) are needed to make a one-liter bottle ( that 's about 34 ounces of water ) ; this includes product water and the water needed for things like cleaning and bottling . it arrived at that figure by asking its members to submit three years of detailed data , touching on factors like total water use and the type of treatment used . writes ibwa , " the study represents 14.5 million liters of bottled water production , an impressive 43 % of total 2011 united states bottled water consumption . " that figure applies to us and canadian companies , and a rep for the group actually calls that " extremely efficient . " npr explains why : a liter of soda demands 2.02 liters of water , while the same quantity of wine requires 4.74 liters . the ibwa chose to stop there in its calculations , but the truth is that the actual " water footprint " is much larger : for instance , oil is needed to make plastic , and drilling for it requires , yep , waterâ€”in some cases as much as seven times what the plastic bottle ultimately contains .
