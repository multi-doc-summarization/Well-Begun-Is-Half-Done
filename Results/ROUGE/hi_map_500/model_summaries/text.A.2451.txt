repo men , a sci-fi thriller about men who repossess organs , is probably supposed to be biting commentary on divisive issues like health care , but critics are united in shouting it down : “ let the 2010 razzies race begin ! ” declares michael rechtshaffen of the hollywood reporter . “ blood soaked , derivative and increasingly ridiculous , ” repo men is an “ in-your-face mess that never knows what it wants to be when it grows up ” and telegraphs its plot twists “ a century in advance . " on paper , the cast—jude law , forest whitaker , liev schreiber—looks great , but this “ heartless piece of hack work ” demeans them , writes joe morgenstern of the wall street journal . “ note to studio : get a soul transplant. ” the movie “ sacrifices subtlety for the obvious , and originality for the tried-and-true—or , more often , the tried-and-trite , ” writes stephen whitty of the star-ledger . “ it ’ s a film to be endured more than experienced. ” roger ebert can ’ t figure out if the film ’ s supposed to be a comedy . when law decapitates three people with one swing of a hacksaw , he writes for the chicago sun-times , “ what are people supposed to think ? is this an action scene , or satire ? does it make any difference ? ”
