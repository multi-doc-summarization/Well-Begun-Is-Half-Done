iowa sen. chuck grassley is taking flak over comments he made about why the gop aims to scrap or least mitigate the estate tax . in speaking to the des moines register , grassley said the tax often derided by republicans as the " death tax " is unfair because it taxes earnings twice , first when people earn the money and again when they die and try to pass it on to their heirs . then came the more controversial part : " i think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing , as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have , whether it ’ s on booze or women or movies . " as npr notes , that triggered a flurry of online criticism from those who viewed grassley 's remarks as elitist . this tweet is typical of the reaction : " i 'm sure those folks would love to invest , but they 're a bit preoccupied just trying to make ends meet . " the washington post notes that it also caught the attention of former hillary clinton spokesman jesse ferguson , who tweeted , " [ i ] f we gave that money in middle class tax cuts , they ’ d just waste it on hookers and blow . right ? ” but it was n't just democrats taking issue . at the conservative hot air site , ed morrissey says the comment " is everything right and wrong with the current republican tax-reform effort in a nutshell . " grassley 's first criticism of the " double dip " problem with the estate tax is spot-on correct , he writes . " in the very next breath , however , grassley commits the same sin that has plagued the tax system for decades , which is congress ’ desire to commit social engineering through it . " the house tax plan would eliminate the tax entirely in 2024 , while the senate version would double exemptions to $ 11 million for individuals and $ 22 million for couples .
