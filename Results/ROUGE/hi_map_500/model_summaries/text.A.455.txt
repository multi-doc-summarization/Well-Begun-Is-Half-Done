think supervolcanoes that devastate entire regions are terrifying ? well sure , but you might be able to outrun themâ€”according to a study that says one prehistoric supervolcano churned out lava at only 10 to 45 miles per hour , live science reports . " it 's really interesting how you can have such a violent eruption producing such slow-moving flows , " says study co-author greg valentine . " they still devastate a huge area , but they 're slow and concentrated and dense . " published in nature communications , the study analyzed an arizona supervolcano known as silver creek caldera that erupted 18.8 million years ago . it churned out lethal tides of gas and ash known as pyroclastic flows for over 100 miles , inundating parts of nevada and california , sciencedaily reports . by analyzing the vast volcanic deposit left by silver creek caldera , researchers found that large rocks had been moved considerable distances . their conclusion : only a constant , heavy flow would have moved rocks that were already miles from the eruption . not everyone buys it , and the researchers warn against taking their study as an excuse for last-minute evacuations . what 's more , smaller eruptions ( like the one that wiped out pompeii ) are known to spew pyroclastic flows at hundreds of miles per hour , wired reports . but it seems anyone 90 miles away from silver creek caldera would have had about 10 hours to escape . " i would n't recommend anyone try to outrun a volcano , but there 's a few of us that could , " says valentine . ( parts of washington and oregon were covered in mysterious ash last year . )
