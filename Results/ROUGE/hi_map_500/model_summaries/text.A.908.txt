alan thicke 's kids are fighting with his third wife over the late actor 's estate . robin thicke and brother brennan , the oldest of thicke 's three sons , say that tanya callau—who wed thicke in 2005—is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of thicke 's estate . thicke left much of his estate to his three children , but callau still inherited a significant amount ( the hollywood reporter has the exact breakdown ) and was allowed to continue living on his carpinteria , calif. , ranch . thicke 's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting callau , and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying thicke . they also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time thicke updated his trust , in february 2016 . ( he died in december . ) but now , thicke 's sons claim , callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust . per a petition the brothers filed in a los angeles court this week , the brothers say callau also claims she has community rights to more of thicke 's assets , she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there , and that she took a step back from her own career to support thicke and help raise his youngest son . the brothers ' attorney says in the filing that callau has " threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity ' unless the co-trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands , " leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and thicke 's will , tmz reports . callau 's rep says in a statement , " tanya thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public .
