abortion opponents in north dakota have one-upped their peers in arkansas . less than two weeks after the latter state banned abortions after 12 weeks , north dakota lawmakers approved a ban after six weeks , reports the bismarck tribune . they also voted to outlaw abortions when a genetic defect is discovered—down syndrome , for example—or when parents do n't like the sex of their fetus . gov . jack dalrymple has n't said whether he will sign the measures , but proponents have enough votes to override even if he vetoes them , reports ap . which means it 's a safe bet that the state will soon have the strictest abortion laws in the nation . lawmakers picked six weeks because that 's when a heartbeat can be detected by transvaginal ultrasound , the intrusive procedure that set off controversy in virginia last year , reports the new york times . arkansas picked 12 weeks because a heartbeat can be detected with an abdominal ultrasound at that point . assuming the north dakota bills become law , expect legal challenges to follow . no other state , for example , has a law that outlaws abortions over a genetic defect . of the 1,247 abortions performed in the state in 2011 , 75 % would be illegal under the new legislation , according to a research group that backs abortion rights . that could well mean that the state 's only abortion clinic , in fargo , would have to close its doors .
