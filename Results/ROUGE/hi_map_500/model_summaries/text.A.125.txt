one of the many jarring videos to emerge from the sunday night mass shooting in las vegas shows a defiant man standing and taunting the gunman while most of those around him were on the ground or trying to find cover . you can see the video here , but note that it 's disturbing . ( the man emerges around the 1:10 mark . ) " come on , " he can be heard yelling , while gesturing with his arms in the direction of the source of the shots . as the daily dot notes , many commenters have criticized the " hyper-macho response , " but is it possible the man inadvertently had the right idea in staying upright ? a story at the new york times that digs into the unusual nature of this attack observes that many people instinctively dropped to their stomachs when the bullets began flying . that 's usually wise , " but on sunday night , the decision potentially put them at greater risk , " per the account by cj chivers , thomas gibbons-neff , and adam goldman . the reason is that the gunman was firing from such a high vantage point , the 32nd floor of the hotel across the street . any " inaccurate shots—the sort common to rapid or hurried fire , which typically sail high or strike the ground short—could still plunge into areas where people were huddled . " still , the choice was stark for concertgoers in the chaos . one puts it this way to the times : “ either run and get shot and die , or stay and get shot and die . ”
