the attack on the us consulate in libya that killed ambassador chris stevens was n't the spontaneous act of violence it initially appeared to beâ€”it was planned . or at least , that 's what the obama administration suspects . whereas yesterday 's riots in egypt appeared spontaneous , attackers in libya showed up with mortars and rocket-propelled-grenades , officials tell the new york times , though they 're not sure yet if those people organized the riot or merely took advantage . but sources tell cnn that they do n't believe stevens was specifically targeted . stevens died of smoke inhalation , a libyan doctor tells the ap . a us official says the building caught fire when someone threw a grenade . employees " were fighting the fire inside and the attackers outside , " the official tells cnn , adding that there were " valiant but unsuccessful " attempts to go back and save people . in a brief statement today , president obama vowed that " justice will be done , " the ap reports . he did n't elaborate on what that might mean , but a senior official says that the white house is expected to approve a plan to send spy drones to look for jihadi camps near benghazi that may have been involved in the attack .
