even after overdose and addiction risks became known , opioid prescriptions continued on the belief that the drugs were more effective at relieving pain than other medications . new research suggests that may not be the case . in a study in jama , scientists say opioids appear to be no better at treating chronic pain than non-opioids like acetaminophen ( tylenol ) , ibuprofen ( advil ) , and lidocaine , which are much less addictive . in a trial of 240 patients—mostly middle-aged white males who 'd endured at least six months of pain in their back , hips , or knees—non-opioid users actually experienced more pain relief than patients using morphine , oxycodone , or hydrocodone , though not in a way that was statistically significant , reports the los angeles times . " there was no significant difference in pain-related function between the 2 groups over 12 months , " say the researchers . half of the trial patients at minneapolis va health care system were given opioids , while the other half were given acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) . both groups reported an average pain score of 5.4 out of 10 at the start of the trial . but after a year , opioid users reported an average score of 4 , compared to 3.5 for non-opioid users , reports reuters . study author erin krebs blames opioid tolerance . " your body gets used to that level of opioid , and you need more and more to get the same level of effect , " she tells nbc news , adding this might explain why opioid users suffered more side effects like constipation , fatigue , and nausea . since the added risks of opioids come with no advantage over other drugs , krebs says people with chronic pain just " should n't start opioids . " ( that goes for kids , too . )
