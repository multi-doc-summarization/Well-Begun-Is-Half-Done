harper lee is apparently as litigious as she is reclusive . the to kill a mockingbird author has , in the guardian 's words , " shocked " her hometown of monroeville , ala. , by suing its local museum . the 87-year-old 's accusation : that the nonprofit is making use of her fame without compensation . the trademark infringement lawsuit , filed oct. 15 , calls out the monroe county heritage museum 's website and gift shop sales of mockingbird-branded goods . the museum says that shop rakes in a measly $ 28,000 annually , which funds a few " pitifully paid " employees , and that it has sold such goods for two decades , reports al.com . but the suit accuses the museum of taking advantage of the book , and cites its web url as example : tokillamockingbird.com . just 30,000 visitors head to the museum annually , and it warns that the suit could prove its undoing . making the story even more contentious : locals are n't sure if lee is actually the driver of the suit , and the museum suspects her " handlers " are taking advantage of her declining health . more confusing still , the suit suggests the museum is exploiting her health by committing bolder trademark violations , notes al.com . lee is deaf and nearly blind , and currently living in an assisted-living facility in monroeville . the guardian does n't exactly make clear who is believed to be the driver , but floats one name : tonya carter , a lawyer married to truman capote 's cousin ( a longtime friend of lee 's ) . many believe lee handed carter power of attorney , though the guardian could find no paper trail proving that .
