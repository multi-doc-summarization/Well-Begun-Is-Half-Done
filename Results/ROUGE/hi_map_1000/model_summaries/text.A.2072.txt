scientists monitoring ice loss in antarctica have chilling news : the melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year , according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal nature . the researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year , reports the bbc . antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s , which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017 , the study found . the researchers , who used satellite data going back more than 25 years , say most of the melting ice comes from the west antarctic sheet , parts of which are in a " state of collapse " —and modest ice growth in the east antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it . " the increasing mass loss that they ’ re finding is really worrying , particularly looking at the west antarctic , the area that ’ s changing most rapidly , " university of waterloo glaciologist christine dow tells the washington post . " and it ’ s the area that we ’ re most worried about , because it ’ s below sea level . " antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues , warn researchers , who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss . " i think we should be worried . that does n't mean we should be desperate , " says study co-author isabella velicogna of the university of california irvine , per the ap . " things are happening . they are happening faster than we expected . "
