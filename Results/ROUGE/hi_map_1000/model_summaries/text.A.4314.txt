the new star wars trailer debuted at halftime during espn 's monday night football , and immediately became a force to be reckoned with both on social media and ticket sites that crashed during presales for its dec. 18 opening . fandango and movie tickets both had issues after offering tickets even before the trailer aired for the jj abrams-directed the force awakens , the hollywood reporter notes . fandango users got hit with a " site maintenance " message , while movie tickets customers received an error warning . imax , meanwhile , waited patiently until after the halftime show to start its selling spree , but also had problems and had to funnel people to the other two sites . meanwhile , buzz about the movie was one for the cosmos , making it hard to find a non-star wars-related tweet for a couple of hours after the trailer aired . the clip—which business insider called " glorious " and the san jose mercury news deemed " spectacular with surprises " —blasted plenty of computer-generated special effects off the screen , as well as close-ups of newbies john boyega as finn , the franchise 's new hero , and daisy ridley as female scavenger rey ( ridley got emotional herself watching the trailer ) . and , to everyone 's great pleasure , there was a han solo-chewie appearance , as well as a rumor-busting interaction between solo and princess leia , the mercury news notes . see the full trailer below . ( this couple should have made dec. 18 their wedding date . )
