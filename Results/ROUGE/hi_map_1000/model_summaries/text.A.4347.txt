a frog named toughie , likely the last of his species , died quietly in his enclosure at the atlanta botanical garden this week , reports the atlanta journal-constitution . " he will be missed by garden staff and visitors alike , " the garden posted on facebook . the rabbs ' fringe-limbed tree frog was n't even discovered until 2005 when scientists were attempting to rescue specimens of any amphibian they could before a deadly chytrid fungal infection hit panama . according to national geographic , toughie made it out of panama , but it 's estimated that the chytrid fungus killed up to 85 % of all amphibians left behind in his natural habitat . he had lived in isolation at the garden since 2008 . a cause of death is unknown , but toughie was believed to be at least 12 years old . in his final years , toughie became a " symbol of the extinction crisis . " his photo was projected onto st. peter 's basilica , and he was visited by film directors and race car drivers . " a lot of people were moved to tears when they saw him , " a photographer who worked with toughie says . " when you have the very last of something it 's a special deal. ‚Äù while some scientists are holding out hope for the rabbs ' tree frog , it 's likely toughie was the last , scientific american reports . his species has n't been seen in the wild since 2007 . it 's rare for humans to actually witness an extinction when it happens and not just learn about it years later . ( for the first time , bees have been put on the endangered species list . )
