the latest prank that all the kids are into is a little more destructive than the toilet paper of yesteryear : called " put 'em in a coffin " and based on a vine video from may that 's gone viral , it involves throwing yourself back-first onto the tops of cars ( and grocery displays , and classroom desks , and one another , etc. ) . and for at least one houston man and his wife , the damage is into the thousands . last friday , james mchugh , 28 , found both his bmw and his wife 's car seriously dented across the hoods , reports kprc-tv , and a home security camera caught grainy footage of seven young men approaching his property . he says it 'll cost about $ 4,000 for the repairs . " you work hard , and then to have that much money washed away for 10 seconds of laughterâ€”it 's very frustrating , " mchugh says . people have been posting videos on youtube , vine , and other social media sites since rapper vonmar of the group thotboyz posted the original back in may , reports the houston chronicle . since then , his video has been viewed more than 3 million times on vine . as for mchugh , there 's no word yet on whether his own security footage will help identify the vandals . ( this high school prank resulted in 62 arrests . )
