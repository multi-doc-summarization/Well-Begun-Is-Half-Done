bucking expectations , obamacare is off to a record-breaking start . the hill reports that around 200,000 signed up for health care coverage on the first day of this year 's enrollment period , compared to 100,000 last year . such early enthusiasm is good news for fans of obamacare , many of whom assumed enrollment would be down this year due to actions by the trump administration , including slicing the advertising budget by 90 % and cutting the length of the enrollment period by half . still , despite the early high numbers , analysts say early enrollees tend to be renewing coverage , not getting it for the first time . last week standard & poor 's said enrollment could drop by as much as 1.6 million this year . with the government 's advertising budget just $ 10 million , some insurance companies are spending their own money to spread the word about the enrollment period , reuters reports . these companies are using advertising both to bring in the young , healthy customers whose coverage keeps premiums down and to clear up any confusion about the cessation of subsidies under trump . the obamacare numbers come as reports have surfaced that the trump administration is preparing an executive order that would effectively wipe out the mandate that most americans have health insurance . the order would state that the administration will not collect the tax penalties from people who fail to get coverage , cnbc reports .
