jonathan butler can finally savor a good meal—and the taste of victory . the 25-year-old university of missouri graduate student , who began a hunger strike on nov. 2 , posted a tweet monday in the wake of school president tim wolfe 's resignation : " the # mizzouhungerstrike is officially over ! " butler also addressed a buoyant crowd about their months of protests against racism and sexism on campus , the new york times reports . " it should not have taken this much , and it is disgusting and vile that we find ourselves in the place that we do , " butler said . he became central to the campaign when he announced that he would consume no " food or nutritional sustenance " until wolfe was out or butler 's " internal organs fail and my life is lost , " the missourian reported at the time . butler found powerful allies when black players on the missouri football team , and then the coaching staff , refused to play with wolfe as president , gawker reports . ( gawker notes that coach gary pinkel earns $ 4 million per year and wolfe less than $ 500,000 . ) " it was really heartwarming and encouraging really because i didn ’ t think that i had people in my corner in the beginning , " butler told the washington post on sunday . what drove butler to take such drastic action , which he says gave him pain , shortness of breath , and wildly fluctuating body temperatures ? " the campus climate here at the university of missouri is an ugly one , " says butler . " i 'm on a campus where people feel free to call people the n-word , where people feel free as recently as last week , to used [ their ] own feces to smear a swastika in a residential hall . everything that glitters is not gold .
