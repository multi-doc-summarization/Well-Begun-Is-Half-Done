an alaska man ducked prison time wednesday in a deal the presiding judge called " breathtaking . " justin schneider , 34 , pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman who says he strangled her unconscious and masturbated on her prone body , cnn reports . charged with four felonies including assault and kidnapping , schneider cut a plea deal for single felony assault . " but i would like the gentleman to be on notice that this is his one pass , " prosecutor andrew grannik said in court , per ktva . " it 's not really a pass , but given the conduct , one might consider that it is . " schneider was accused of assaulting the woman in anchorage in august 2017 after offering her a ride . " she said she could not fight him off , he was too heavy and had her down being choked to death , " the complaint reads . " [ the victim ] said she lost consciousness , thinking she was going to die , " per the complaint . when she awoke , he was zipping up and " told her that he was n't really going to kill her , that he needed her to believe she was going to die so that he could be sexually fulfilled . " so why the plea deal ? schneider lost his job as an air traffic controller , which grannik called a " life sentence . " and judge michael cory , who called the deal " breathtaking , " said he hoped schneider could be rehabilitated . as for schneider , he offered no apology and said he " would just like to emphasize how grateful i am for this process . " he was sentenced to two years , one suspended , and received credit for time spent at home with his family . the assault survivor did not show up for trial .
