days before his death this summer , 39-year-old max spiers texted his mother these words : " if anything happens to me , investigate . " the brit just happened to be a well-known figure in the world of ufo researchers , and now conspiracy theories are running wild . authorities in poland , where spiers died , say it was natural causes , and the british government has declined to investigate , reports the independent . his peers in the ufo community , however , are more than a little skeptical . kerry cassidy at project camelot says " the entire circumstances are suspicious and i urge everyone to encourage [ the release of details ] about what really happened and call for an autopsy . " another ufo blogger says , per sfgate : " healthy people do n't just get sick and die , they get poisoned . " according to the telegraph , spiers had been invited to poland to speak about his theories at a conference . friends say he had been staying with a woman in warsaw ahead of the conference and was vomiting black liquid and suffering from migraines before being found dead on a couch . spiers ' mother , vanessa bates , describes him as a " very fit man who was in good health , " and she fears her son made enemies after " digging into dark places . " but ufo expert nick pope tweeted sunday that the idea of spiers being silenced is a little much . " having run the uk government 's ufo project i promise we do n't go around killing ufo researchers . " ( only in roswell could police investigate a missing flying saucer . )
