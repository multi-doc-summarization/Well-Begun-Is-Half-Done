tom hanks was just trying to do his civic duty , and he ended up inadvertently messing up a trial . hanks was serving on a jury in la this week , but when a lawyer in the city attorney 's office made the mistake of talking to the actor , the case had to be settled with a plea deal . the prosecuting attorney revealed the interaction tuesday and asked for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct , cnn reports . instead , yesterday , both sides agreed to a reduced charge . the defendant initially faced up to a year in jail on domestic assault charges ; the reduced disturbing the peace charge carries with it just a $ 150 fine . so what did the lawyer approach hanks about ? he reportedly thanked the actor for his service . tmz earlier reported that hanks was either an awesome juror or just acting like one : taking lots of notes , listening closely , talking to the other jurors during the breaks , and laughing at one of the lawyer 's jokes . the defense attorney confirms to cnn that , though he was initially skeptical of putting hanks on the jury , " he never looked or made any statements like he wanted to get off jury duty . so based on everything , he seemed like a very fair juror . " how would he have voted ? the defense attorney says hanks simply " looked at me like he always had , smiled and said , ' i was going to vote the way of justice . ' "
