a man convicted four years ago in the oldest cold case ever tried was freed friday after an illinois judge vacated his conviction and subsequent life sentence , cnn reports . according to cbs news , 76-year-old jack mccullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl , choking her , and stabbing her to death in 1957 . the case was reopened in 2008 , and mccullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year . after an appeal by mccullough , illinois state 's attorney richard schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls " clear and convincing evidence " that mccullough is innocent . while the judge friday vacated mccullough 's conviction , he stopped short of declaring him innocent , and a new trial will be held , the chicago tribune reports . mccullough , who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl , says he was 40 miles away at an air force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping . it 's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the fbi 's original timeline for the kidnapping . that timeline was later changed by police , and schmack says documents—including phone and air force records—supporting mccullough 's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial . a friend of the kidnapped girl picked mccullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened . but his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup , and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier . that info was n't allowed at mccullough 's trial either . no physical evidence was ever found to support mccullough 's conviction .
