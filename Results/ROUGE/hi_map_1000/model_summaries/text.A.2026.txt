donald trump 's lawyer seems pretty ignorant of the law—at least as it pertains to marital rape . the daily beast reports that when michael cohen , special counsel for the trump organization , was asked about an alleged incident from 1989 involving trump 's ex-wife ivana , he claimed " that by the very definition , you ca n't rape your spouse " —and then threatened reporter tim mak , allegedly telling him to " tread very f -- -ing lightly , because what i 'm going to do to you is going to be f -- -ing disgusting . " " you write a story that has mr. trump 's name in it , with the word 'rape , ' and i 'm going to mess your life up ... for as long as you 're on this frickin ' planet , " cohen warned , per the beast , which notes that new york outlawed marital rape in 1984 . the alleged incident cohen was asked about was described in the 1993 trump biography lost tycoon : the many lives of donald j. trump , reports the new york daily news . the book , citing a divorce deposition , describes an incident in which trump allegedly forced himself on ivana as revenge for her having talked him into failed scalp-reduction surgery , though the book contains a statement from her saying that while she referred to the incident as " rape , " she does n't want her words " to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense . " a trump spokesperson tells business insider that the incident is " old news and it never happened " and that ivana made it up to " exploit " trump during divorce proceedings .
