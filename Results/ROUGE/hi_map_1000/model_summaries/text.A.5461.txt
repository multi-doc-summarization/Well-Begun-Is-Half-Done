military officials who 've been trying to justify a jan. 29 raid that killed a navy seal in yemen now say the goal was to capture al-qaeda leader qassim al-rimi , who they believe escaped unscathed . they believe this because al-rimi—considered the third most dangerous terrorist in the world , per nbc news—can be heard taunting president trump in an 11-minute audio recording released over the weekend , which officials believe is authentic . " the new fool of the white house received a painful slap across his face , " cnn quotes al-rimi as saying . al-rimi also claims 25 people died in the raid , noting " dozens of americans were killed and wounded , " per the ap . the us military has said one navy seal died and three others were wounded . a white house official tells nbc that trump approved the raid after defense secretary james mattis and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joseph dunford told him al-rimi 's capture would be a " game changer . " however , an official tells cnn that al-rimi was not essential to the mission , which officials believed would lead to him one way or another . though al-rimi was n't captured—it is n't clear if he was at the site—military officials have said the mission was " successful . " fourteen al-qaeda fighters were killed and " al-qaeda was disrupted , at least in terms of that cell , " says a former national security adviser under former president george w. bush . " they understand that the us is willing to lean forward , and perhaps they 're being deterred or disrupted in their activities . " ( the military initially claimed it nabbed a decade-old video . )
