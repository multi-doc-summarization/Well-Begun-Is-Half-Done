britain 's royal air force has scrambled fighter jets twice this month after receiving warnings of possible attempts to hijack american passenger jets , defense sources say . both incidents proved to be false alarms but they have put fresh focus on britain 's post 9/11 counterterrorism procedures for commercial aircraft , the bbc reports . the guardian notes that pm gordon brown was alerted , and could have faced the decision of whether to shoot an airliner down to avoid a potential attack . in the most recent incident , fighter jets were scrambled after air traffic controllers overheard the words " hostage " and " ransom " in a conversation on a flight from the us , followed by a highly unusual request to carry out a sudden descent to test auxiliary power units . the jets followed the aircraft through uk airspace and into belgium , where it landed . defense officials said the matter was resolved but declined to provide further details .
