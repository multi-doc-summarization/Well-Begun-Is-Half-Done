pregnancy affects not only a woman 's body : it changes parts of her brain , too , a new study published in nature neuroscience says . the study includes data on 25 spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies , along with 20 women who did n't get pregnant during the study . the brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups . the results were consistent : a computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the mri scans . and the changes , first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth , were mostly still present two years after childbirth . ( based on prior research findings , the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy ) . no brain changes were seen in first-time fathers , reports the ap . what 's going on ? elseline hoekzema , a study author at leiden university in the netherlands , and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman . in 11 places in the brain , the mri data indicate reductions in volume of the brain 's gray matter , but it 's not clear what that means . for example , it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate , called synapses . losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing . it happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence , producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits . the researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women , perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood . one analysis linked brain changes to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant .
