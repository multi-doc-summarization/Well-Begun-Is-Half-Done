to call it controversial is putting it mildly : harvard professor karen l. king in september 2012 debuted an ancient papyrus now known as the " gospel of jesus ' wife " at a conference in rome . the papyrus makes an explicit reference to the woman 's existence with the line , " jesus said to them , 'my wife ... ' " now , extensive testing by professors from columbia , harvard , and mit in the fields of electrical engineering , chemistry , and biology has found no indications that it is a modern forgery , per an article by king published today in the harvard theological review . the boston globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century egypt , and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time . but the globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials , and that traditional ink-dating methods could n't be used because the papyrus is so small : a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines ( translation here ) . the review also published a rebuttal by brown egyptology professor leo depuydt , who points to " gross grammatical errors " he says no native speaker of coptic would make , the new york times reports . ( more criticism of the papyrus here . ) the new findings certainly do n't prove that jesus was married , a point that king has never challenged ; she 'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document 's significance , and " questions like , 'why does jesus being married , or not , even matter ? ' " king was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner , who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it , along with five others , in east germany in the '60s .
