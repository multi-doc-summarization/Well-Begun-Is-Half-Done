dr. fredric brandt " was a huge pioneer " when it came to botox and other anti-aging techniques , a fellow dermatologist says . in fact , he was once called the " baron of botox , " and he boasted such celebrity clients as madonna and kelly ripa . but on sunday the 65-year-old died of an apparent suicide at his florida home ; a publicist tells the new york times that he 'd not only been struggling with depression , but was " devastated " by an apparent parody of him on unbreakable kimmy schimdt . martin short played a character on the netflix series who looks similar to brandt , with features that make it seem the fictional doctor has been using botox to excess on himself . brandt was known for experimenting on himself before trying a new treatment on patients . brandt was found hanged in his garage , the miami herald reports . multiple sources who talked to people agree the show hurt him , but one says not to blame short 's character ( dr. grant , pronounced franff ) for brandt 's death . " did the show upset him ? yes . he was a human being , no one would like that . it was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying , " the source says . but " it was n't the only thing troubling him , it was just one factor . but that was not why he committed suicide . but it did n't help . " the source blames the " illness " of depression . meanwhile , allure 's editor remembers brandt 's contributions : " when he came into dermatology it was people treating sunspots and removing moles . suddenly there were all these new substances and techniques that altered our relationship to age and aging , and he was at the absolute forefront of that .
