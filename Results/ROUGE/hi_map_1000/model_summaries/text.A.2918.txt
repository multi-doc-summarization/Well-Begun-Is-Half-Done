police who found at least seven corpses in a building in fort worth , texas , yesterday quickly determined there was no serial killer at workâ€”but there were funeral directors who had apparently moved out with work unfinished . police say the building 's owner evicted the johnson family mortuary two weeks ago and he discovered the bodies when he went to check on the building , the fort worth star-telegram reports . the unattended bodies ranged in age from infants to adults and police say they were in " varying stages of decomposition , some quite advanced . " the twin brothers who ran the business could face charges of abuse of a corpse , but they insist it is all a misunderstanding . " we 've done nothing wrong , " one of the brothers tells the dallas morning news . " this is a funeral home . this is where we keep bodies . " the electricity and air conditioning in the building were still on , but it did not have a refrigeration system . a spokesman for the texas funeral service commission says the mortuary 's license expires this month , and the business already is the focus of five separate investigations .
