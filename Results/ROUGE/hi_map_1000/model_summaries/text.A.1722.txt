in what the uk 's civil aviation authority says would be " a totally unacceptable " first , a british airways plane landing at heathrow appears to have been hit by a drone on sunday , the bbc reports . the airbus a320 coming into london from geneva had 132 passengers and five crew members aboard , a ba spokesman tells cnn ; the incident was reported after the ba pilot touched down . " our aircraft landed safely , was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight , " the rep says . no arrests have been made ( it 's unclear whose drone it may have been ) , and the aviation security arm of the metropolitan police is looking into the matter . police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal , nbc news reports , with punishment including up to five years in prison . specifically , drones over 15 pounds ca n't fly higher than 400 feet and are n't permitted to fly " beyond the direct unaided line of sight " of its operator or near crowds or buildings . not that the incident came as a total surprise : the head of the international air transport association had previously noted the " real and growing threat " of a drone-plane hit , while a british airline pilots association rep says it was " only a matter of time . " a recent study by bard college 's center for the study of the drone underscores the danger in us airspace , with 327 " close encounters " of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between december 2013 and september 2015 , and at least 28 pilots " [ maneuvering ] to avoid a collision with a drone . " frighteningly , aviation experts say they do n't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane 's engine , a civil aviation authority rep tells nbc . ( a drone recently came within 200 feet of a plane at lax . )
