hackers got their hands on ap 's twitter feed today and briefly sent blood pressures racing with an afternoon tweet that president obama had been injured in a pair of white house explosions , reports the huffington post . the real ap tweeted minutes later that it was a hoax and suspended the account . incredibly , the dow had been up 130 points before the tweet and lost all of it within a minute , reports the wall street journal . then it bounced right back to where it was when the hoax was revealed . no official word yet on who 's behind the hack , though tmz says it 's the same group that has been " swatting " celebs with phony 911 calls .
