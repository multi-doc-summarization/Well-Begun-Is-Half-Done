it 's not only the rockettes who were upset to learn they 'd be performing for the 45th us president . thousands of people have signed a petition asking the mormon tabernacle choir to rescind its acceptance of an invitation to perform at donald trump 's inauguration next month , and now a singer says she 's opted to quit the choir in protest , reports the salt lake tribune . in a resignation letter posted to facebook , jan chamberlin says she weighed the decision over " several sleepless nights and days [ spent ] in turmoil and agony " but determined " i could never look myself in the mirror again with self-respect " if she agreed to perform . " i only know i could never 'throw roses to hitler . ' and i certainly could never sing for him , " she writes . just as the rockettes are n't required to perform , neither are the 360 choir members , only 215 of whom will perform based on a lottery system ; it 's up to members to submit their names . but chamberlin—who 's received hateful messages since her resignation , per kifi—says " it will appear that [ the ] choir is endorsing tyranny and facism [ sic ] by singing for this man . " the petition , signed by more than 20,000 so far , adds that the move " does not reflect the values of mormonism and does not represent its diverse 15+ million members worldwide . " a rep for the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , however , says the performance is " a demonstration of our support for freedom , civility , and the peaceful transition of power " and " not an implied support of party affiliations or politics .
