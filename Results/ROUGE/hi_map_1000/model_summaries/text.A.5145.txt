cavities are far from a modern woe , reveals a new study of a 5,300-year-old " ice mummy . " " Ã¶tzi " did n't just have the bad luck of dying on a glacier , he also suffered from terrible teeth , reports science . though his remains were discovered on the austro-italian border in 1991 , his teeth had never been assessed . researchers circled back to a cat scan taken in 2005 to review his " oral cavity " and " study evolutionary aspects of oral disease , " per their abstract in the european journal of oral sciences . what they determined , as translated from dental-speak ( " the poor periodontal condition of the iceman 's dentition , eg , loss of alveolar bone ... " ) by science : a discolored front tooth as the result of some sort of accident , a broken molar , cavities , and gum disease . a diet involving gruel may have been responsible for the latter two conditions . in fact , the researchers believe that the rise of starches in the diets of the time may be linked to a corresponding increase in cavities .
