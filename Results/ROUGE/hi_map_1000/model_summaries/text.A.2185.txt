funding for research included in the explosive dossier on president trump 's russia connections came from none other than the hillary clinton campaign and the democratic national committee , per reports in the washington post and the new york times . a letter filed in court tuesday details how research firm fusion gps began working in april 2016 for a law firm employed by the clinton campaign and the dnc to gather damaging information on trump . according to the letter , fusion gps had already been doing research on trump on behalf of one of the republican 's primary opponents before it was hired by perkins coie , the firm of clinton campaign lawyer mark elias . trump has long slammed the dossier compiled by british ex-spy christopher steele as politically motivated " fake news . " in a tweet last week , trump wondered whether the fbi , the democrats , russia , or all three had funded it . he 's now expected to repeat conspiracy allegations , though sources tell the post and the times that clinton and dnc officials were unaware of the role of fusion gps . the ap reports the fbi has corroborated parts of the dossier , which alleges russia worked to help the trump campaign and amassed compromising information on him . former clinton spokesman brian fallon tweeted that if he 'd known about steele 's role , he would " have volunteered to go to europe and try to help him . " he added that if the information compiled by steele helps robert mueller 's investigation , anything paid to him and fusion gps would be " money well spent . "
