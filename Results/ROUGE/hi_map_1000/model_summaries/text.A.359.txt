bad news for madonna : a judge on monday said a new york auction house can go ahead and sell some of her personal stuff . got ta have rock and roll auctions got a hold of a pair of the singer 's underwear , a letter tupac shakur wrote to her explaining why they had to break up , and other items of hers including a hairbrush , a checkbook , cassette tapes of unreleased recordings , a letter she wrote calling whitney houston and sharon stone " horribly mediocre , " and photos . madonna had obtained a temporary restraining order last year to halt the sale , saying she did n't know the items were no longer in her possession and believes someone took them from her home . but on monday , a manhattan judge ruled that the items belong to the auction house and the sale can go ahead , nbc news reports . the auction house says the sale will proceed in july . the guardian and the new york times explain that the judge found madonna had targeted the wrong person in her legal action : darlene lutz , an art collector who helped madonna build her collection before the two had a falling-out . madonna claimed her assistants had given her things to lutz , and the judge said madonna should have targeted those assistants rather than lutz . ( lutz herself once said that 's how she came into the items , simply by collecting things that were otherwise going to be thrown out : " i knew all of the assistants and stuff would get thrown in boxes and they would just go , 'hey , here â€™ s some more . ' " ) lutz said she and the material girl had settled their disagreements in a 2004 legal agreement , and the judge sided with lutz and found that that agreement prevented madonna from suing . the judge also found that the statute of limitations to recover the items had passed . " ms. lutz is now free to do with her property as she pleases without any continued interference by madonna , " said lutz 's lawyer .
