james tumblin 's 300,000-piece collection of gone with the wind memorabilia started with a single gray dress with black appliques that lay crumpled on the floor of the western costume company in los angeles in the 1960s . " a docent told me not to bother to pick it up , because they were throwing it away , " tumblin , who once ran the hair and makeup department at universal studios , told the telegraph last month . but " i had noticed there was a printed label saying selznick international pictures , and 'scarlett production dress ' was written in ink , " he said . " i asked if he would sell it to me . " he ended up paying just $ 20 for the costume , worn by vivien leigh as scarlett o'hara in four scenes of the 1939 film—an incredible bargain considering the dress sold at auction on saturday for $ 137,000 . the outfit—really a jacket and skirt ensemble—was actually pale blue during filming . but some of the 150 gone with the wind pieces sold by heritage auctions this weekend remain in pristine condition , including a gray wool suit clark gable wore when he kicked down scarlett o'hara 's boudoir door as rhett butler , cnn reports ; it sold for $ 55,000 . a straw hat worn by leigh fetched $ 52,500 , while a black bonnet donned by leigh and olivia de havilland 's character melanie wilkes sold for $ 30,000 , reuters reports . tumblin seems happy to have been able to offer up his pieces , many of which have toured the country . " i am really looking forward to walking through a museum and seeing something that i once owned , " he said . he still maintains the largest private collection of gone with the wind memorabilia , which includes leigh 's oscar . ( the film almost did n't make it to the screen . )
