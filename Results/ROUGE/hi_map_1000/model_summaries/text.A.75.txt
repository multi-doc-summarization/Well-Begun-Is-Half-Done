after a furor over changes to its ad terms of service , instagram tried to clear things up ; now , it 's simply dropping the changes , the new york times reports . the company is returning to its old advertising terms from 2010 , co-founder kevin systrom wrote in a blog post . " rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed , we are going to take the time to complete our plans , and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work . " " i want to be really clear , " he added . " instagram has no intention of selling your photos , and we never did . we don ’ t own your photos—you do . " still , the move may have come too late for some users : similar services like pheed saw more new users yesterday than any other app in the us , while flickr 's app jumped in popularity from 175 to somewhere in the 20s among itunes rankings . the question remains , then , how the free service will monetize , notes the times .
