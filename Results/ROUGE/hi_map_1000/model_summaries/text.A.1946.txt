andre johnson , the wu-tang clan-affiliated rapper who severed his own penis in april before jumping off a building , has explained his actions ... sort of . " i cut it off because that was the root of all my problems , " the 41-year-old rapper , who also uses the name christ bearer , tells e ! . " my solution to the problem was the realization that sex is for mortals , and i am a god . ... those kinds of activities got me into trouble , and i came here to be a god . " he also spoke to the new york daily news , noting that he had been reading about monks and vasectomies at the time . oh , and probably coincidentally , he admits he was on drugs , too .

" but , it still gets hard , the little bit that i got . i still got some penis that works , " he says . " i definitely still get extremely aroused if i see a beautiful woman . " but , despite his previous remarks , he adds , " i was n't having that much sex up to that point anyways . my days of reproducing are over . but now i 'm a reborn man . " as for why he jumped , " that was just my response to the demons . they were doing their best to get to me , but being alive solidified my thoughts , " he says . " i 'm alive , penis or no penis . " he 's speaking out for the first time since the incident because " the truth must be told , " he says . what 's next for him ? " i love comedy , " he says .
