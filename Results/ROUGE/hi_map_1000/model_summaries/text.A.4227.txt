it 's official : if you want to see a movie while it 's still in the theaters , you 'll have to take off your google glass or smartwatch first . the mpaa and the national association of theatre owners yesterday banned all wearable tech , meaning you 'll need to turn such devices off and put them away if you do n't want to get kicked out . and—in a policy that already exists for phones and other recording devices—if theater staff thinks you 're recording illegally , they 'll notify police . the new zero-tolerance policy was approved during the showeast convention , where theater owners gather each year , according to the hollywood reporter ; the washington post reports that the association represents about 32,000 us theaters . but many individual theater owners had already instituted such a ban . two potential problems : the new rule " ignores something pretty crucial , " writes greg kumparak on techcrunch . " if someone is the type of person who will strap a computer to their face , they 're probably also the type of person who knows of easier/better ways to pirate movies than recording a shaky , crap-resolution copy on google glass . " plus , what happens when smart glasses become more popular and some people " choose to use the device as their primary eyewear " ? wonders chris morran at the consumerist . " at that point , do theaters kick people out just for wearing glasses that could shoot video ? " one theatergoer has already been hauled from his seat by the feds because he was wearing google glass .
