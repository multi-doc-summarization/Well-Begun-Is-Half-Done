if your visions of high-profile hedge fund managers include frenetic scrambling through paperwork , fielding endless phone calls , and scouring the internet during never-ending workdays , those do n't apply to steve edmundson , the investment head of nevada 's $ 35 billion public employees ' retirement system , the wall street journal notes . where other states ' retirement systems try to come up with the most complex investments possible to beat the markets , the 44-year-old edmundson has a different philosophy when it comes to day-to-day trading : " do as little as possible , usually nothing , " as the journal puts it . and by " nothing , " that means not obsessing over the daily fluctuations in oil prices , the elections , or even what janet yellen is up to—an approach that 's rare among managers of large pension funds , the new york times noted last year in an article about edmundson . this laissez-faire tactic has served edmundson well : his system 's returns over anywhere from one to 10 years are competitive , if not better , than the pension systems of other states , including the largest public one—california 's . even edmundson 's desk looks like it 's his first day on the job , with just basic office supplies , a few family pics , and a printer—no fancy bloomberg terminal to monitor real-time market info . edmundson is able to kick back by keeping the system 's stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds , though one investment strategy expert ( who held the job before edmundson ) concedes " doing nothing is harder than it looks " when it comes to showing such restraint . edmundson 's minimalist philosophy even carries over to lunch : he brings leftovers or a sandwich from home so he does n't have to spend $ 10 each day . ( a typical steve edmundson day , in the wall street journal . )
