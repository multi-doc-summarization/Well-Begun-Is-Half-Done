a los angeles restaurant owner is sick of seeing customers spend more time with their cell phones than their dinner companions â€¦ so he 's offering a cheaper meal to anyone willing to put the phone down . patrons who check their phones at the door of eva restaurant get a 5 % discount . " for us , it 's really not about people disrupting other guests . eva is home , and we want to create that environment of home , and we want people to connect again , " owner mark gold tells kpcc . " it 's about two people sitting together and just connecting , without the distraction of a phone . " gold adds that he himself is guilty of using his cell phone as " part of the table setting " these days . " every table you look at , it 's a wine glass , the silverware and the cell phone , " he says . but his idea is catching on , with just under half of his customers accepting the offer . ( hat tip to gawker for the find . )
