danish divers made a grisly discovery friday : they found the head and legs of journalist kim wall in a bay near copenhagen , reports reuters . what 's more , the discovery appears to further undermine the unraveling story of inventor peter madsen , who has been accused of killing her . divers in koge bay found two bags , one with wall 's remaining body parts—her torso had previously washed up—and another containing her clothes and a knife , per cnn . the bags had been weighted down with pieces of metal . the 30-year-old was last seen alive on aug. 10 when she boarded madsen 's submarine . madsen , whose story has changed , maintains that wall died accidentally when the sub 's heavy metal hatch struck her in the head . however , authorities say an autopsy shows no such damage to wall 's head , reports the bbc . madsen , 46 , remains imprisoned as the investigation continues . he has admitted to disposing of wall 's body at sea , but says he did so in a panic because he blamed himself for losing his grip on the hatch . prosecutors , however , paint a much darker picture . they point to disturbing videos found on madsen 's computer showing the torture and decapitation of women and to a post-mortem examination that revealed knife wounds to wall 's genitals and rib cage " around or shortly after her death . " authorities say they hope the new evidence will help them determine a cause of death .
