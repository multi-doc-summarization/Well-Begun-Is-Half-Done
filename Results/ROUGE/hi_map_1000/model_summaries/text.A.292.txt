rarely reticent after overseas incidents , president trump spoke up early friday after news streamed across the pond of a rush-hour explosion in the london underground that injured at least 18 people . he railed on twitter against the " loser terrorists , " calling those responsible " sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard . " ( the telegraph notes scotland yard has n't yet indicated that 's actually the case ; politico says it 's " unclear " what info trump used to make that assessment . ) trump also suggested we must deal with any such terrorists " in a much tougher manner , " including cutting off " their main recruitment tool " : the internet . the independent reports it 's not the first time trump has mentioned internet restrictions , noting he said in late 2015 he wanted to " see bill gates " about " closing it up . " trump 's tweets next segued into a call to make the us travel ban " far larger , tougher and more specific , " though he lamented that " stupidly , that would not be politically correct ! " and finally , a dig against his predecessor : " we have made more progress in the last nine months against isis than the obama administration has made in 8 years . must be proactive & nasty ! " shortly after his terrorist-themed tweets , trump moved on to a new topic : the controversy over espn host jemele hill ( though he did n't mention her by name ) , who earlier this week called him a " white supremacist . " " espn is paying a really big price for its politics ( and bad programming ) . people are dumping it in record numbers . apologize for untruth ! " he tweeted .
