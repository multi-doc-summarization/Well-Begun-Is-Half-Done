have a great idea about how to map the ocean floor ? it could be worth millions . the x prize foundation , which two years ago asked for a way to gauge ocean acidification , is offering $ 7 million to teams able to develop high-resolution maps of the seafloor over the next three years . the latest competition meant to better humankind aims to hurry " innovation to further explore one of our greatest unexplored frontiers , " x prize ceo peter diamandis tells nbc news , noting " 95 % of the deep sea remains a mystery to us . " in truth , we have better maps of the moon and mars than of the seafloor , per national geographic and live science . the foundation will accept submissions for robots capable of creating high-resolution maps , identifying geological and archaeological features like volcanoes and shipwrecks , and taking photos until september 2016 . the devices will be tested at 6,500 and 13,000 feet about a year later . " this competition is technically challenging , but it is also very interdisciplinary , " says x prize 's senior director . " it involves underwater robotics , it involves computer science , there is a digital imagery component to it . we want to help spur unparalleled ocean exploration through innovation and radical breakthroughs to find all the different wonders in the deep sea . " the team that claims the top prize will take home $ 4 million , the second-place team will get $ 1 million , and an additional $ 1 million will be divided among other teams in the top 10 . there will also be a $ 1 million award funded by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for any device that can follow a chemical or biological signal to detect " sources of pollution , enable rapid response to leaks and spills , identify hydrothermal vents and methane seeps , as well as track marine life for scientific research and conservation efforts , " per an noaa scientist .
