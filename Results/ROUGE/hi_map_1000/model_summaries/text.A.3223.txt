chris christie has responded to today 's amazing allegations that his aides deliberately caused massive traffic jams on the world 's busiest bridge to punish a political rival : the new jersey governor insists that he had nothing to do with it and suggests that heads will roll , reports politico . the statement : " what i 've seen today for the first time is unacceptable . i am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was i misled by a member of my staff , but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge . one thing is clear : this type of behavior is unacceptable and i will not tolerate it because the people of new jersey deserve better . this behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way , and people will be held responsible for their actions . " if you missed it , emails emerged from several media outlets suggesting that christie aides ordered two lanes shut down on the george washington bridge in september , which led to gridlock in the town of fort leeâ€”because fort lee mayor mark sokolich would n't endorse christie in his re-election campaign against democrat barbara buono . for her part , buono has called on the justice department to look into criminal charges . " it clearly exposes a web of deceit and subterfuge and political retribution leading straight to chris christie , " she tells the star-ledger . though christie did n't mention names , the emails show that a top aide , bridget anne kelly , told a christie-appointed official at the port authority , david wildstein , that it was " time for some traffic problems in fort lee . " the emails do not implicate christie himself , notes the new york times , though the governor initially said nobody affiliated with his office or campaign was involved .
