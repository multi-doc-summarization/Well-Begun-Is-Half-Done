the remote alaska town of galena is accustomed to spring flooding , so much so that many of its homes are built on stilts , reports the ap . but it was n't prepared for what it faced this week : a 30-mile ice jam that literally jammed the yukon river and unleashed intense flooding on the town . the waters began to rise sunday and by yesterday many of galena 's 500 residents had fled via plane , with a few holdouts camping at the airport , one of the only dry spots left . homes have been ripped from their foundations , cell and electrical service is down , and the bridge to the airport was knocked out . a weather service hydrologist at the scene tells the anchorage daily news that bathrooms are n't functioning and " there are houses that are totally submerged in water up to the roof . " though no injuries or deaths have been reported , locals say just about every house has suffered damage . and with temps hitting the 80s , the jam is starting to break upâ€”putting a community 14 miles downriver from the jam at risk . says koyukuk 's mayor , " we 're looking at a flash flood . something like a dam breaking . " the expectation is that when the jam breaks , it will send a wave of water toward koyukuk , reaching it in about four hours .
