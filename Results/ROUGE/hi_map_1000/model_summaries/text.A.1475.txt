georgia 's senate has voted 48-2 to shift the state 's northern border to include a sliver of land it says was wrongly given to tennessee by a surveyor 's blunder in 1818 . georgia says the " mismarked boundary lines " have denied it access to the tennessee river as a source of water and it says it will take its northern neighbor to court if it does n't agree to surrender a slice of land big enough to allow it to do so , reports the chattanooga times free press . georgia gov . nathan deal would have to sign off on any border change , as would tennessee and the us congress , the atlanta journal-constitution adds . " it is not something that would negatively impact the water supply of tennessee , " deal says . the border dispute is n't likely to spark war between georgia and tennesseeâ€”but alabama sits just downstream from the disputed area and , since it has suffered from drought as much as northern georgia in recent years , it is unlikely to give up its water without some kind of fight , the atlantic notes .
