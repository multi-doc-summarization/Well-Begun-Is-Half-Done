the families of nine sandy hook victims and one teacher who survived the deadly mass shooting presented their case to connecticut supreme court justices tuesday in their lawsuit against remington , maker of the ar-15 weapon used by adam lanza to kill 20 children and six adults in 2012 , the hartford courant reports . the victims ' argument centers around the marketing campaign behind the ar-15 , which the mother of one 6-year-old victim tells cbs news was " morally reprehensible . " the lawsuit claims remington linked " the ar-15 to macho vigilantism and military-style insurrection " in order to target a " younger demographic " and increase sales . one ar-15 ad included the tagline " consider your man card reissued . " another ad touted it as " the ultimate combat weapons system , " according to reuters . josh koskoff , lawyer for the victims ' families , compared it to " the ford motor company advertising a car that can run over people " and said that kind of advertising attracts " dangerous users , " including lanza . " adam lanza heard their message , " koskoff told the justices tuesday . " he idolized the military and remington advertised the ar-15 as the weapon used by army rangers . " he says remington " knew exactly what they were doing " with its marketing strategies . james vogts , lawyer for remington , says the company is protected by the 2005 lawful commerce in arms act that shields gun makers from liability in shootings . " no matter how much we wished those children and teachers were still alive , the law needs to be applied , " vogts told justices . following tuesday 's arguments , justices will decide whether the families ' lawsuit can go to trial .
