facebook held a major press event today , but kept the media guessing about what it would be unveiling . the answer was what mark zuckerberg described as the " third pillar " of facebook : graph search . basically , the idea is to allow people to search for people , places , and things to do through their networks , the official announcement explains . for example , if you were trying to set up a game of thrones viewing party , you might search for " friends in [ your town ] who like game of thrones . " going out ? search " movies my friends like . " dating ? search " friends of friends in [ your town ] who are single . " the system will be " privacy aware , " zuckerberg said , so " you can only search for content that has been shared with you . " it will also integrate bing results , broadening the kind of information it can findâ€”though at one point zuckerberg added that he " would love to work with google . " the system is being rolled out as a limited beta release starting today . right now , zuckerberg says there are no plans to monetize the feature , though he said it " could potentially be a business over time . " some instant reactions : farhad manjoo : " this is the most natural-language search i 've ever seen . it 's a completely different paradigm from searching google . phrases , not keywords . " mike isaac : " google built web search first , then tried to slap google+ on top of it for personalization . facebook taking the backwards approach . " ( see more from isaac here . ) henry blodget : " i do n't see how facebook cashes in with this thing . search could coin it for them . this , as executed , is just another feature . " the stock market : shortly after the rollout , facebook 's stock was down 2 % , according to the wall street journal .
