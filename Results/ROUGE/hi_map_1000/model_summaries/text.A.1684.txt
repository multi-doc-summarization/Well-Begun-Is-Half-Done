the clarion nightsnake is hard to spot , so hard to spot that for decades , the only sighting of the species native to one of mexico 's revillagigedo islands—the original sighting—was assumed to be a mistake . a joint us-mexico team , however , managed to rediscover the species found by american naturalist william beebe in 1936 by using his original field notes to retrace his steps and search for the nocturnal snake , which blends in with the island 's rock formations , the ap reports . the expedition found 11 of the snakes , and dna tests confirmed that the clarion island snake is a unique species , reports the bbc . the snake is related to snakes found on part of the mexican coast more than 500 miles away , and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago . beebe returned from a visit to the island , located 400-plus miles off mexico 's pacific coast , nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar , but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries . the national museum of natural history praised the team 's work , describing the snake as the " only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error . " the rediscovery " is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in , " the museum said in a statement .
