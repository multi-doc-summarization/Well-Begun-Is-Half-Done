amazon has an open secret that few pay heed to : a " nearly invisible workforce " that works to get consumers their packages on demand , per gizmodo . bryan menegus dives into the company 's flex program , responsible for the firm 's " last-mile " service , which involves getting ordered goods to a customer from the last local shipment site on the delivery chain . but while the driving program is described online by amazon as letting those interested " be your own boss , set your own schedule , and have more time to pursue your goals and dreams , " menegus—who chatted with 15 current or ex-drivers from nine states and two countries , as well as with three contractors from local courier companies tied to amazon—instead paints it as an exploitive system that considers its drivers " utterly expendable " and offers them little recourse to address issues or unfair practices . what he found is that getting into the flex program can be simple : entry criteria are " modest " ( e.g. , being over 21 , having a smartphone with the flex app ) , as is training . one uk driver says : " honestly , it seems they take on anyone . " but once on board , drivers say they face faulty data systems , altercations between drivers vying for prime routes ( and high-tech cheating to claim those routes ) , and a lack of support from " hot-headed warehouse managers " who take a " customer is always right " attitude . and one labor attorney thinks not everything is on the up-and-up when it comes to how the company handles its drivers : considering them contractors , but treating them like employees , with all of the responsibility and few benefits . " i think it 's breaking the law in a pretty widespread way , " she says . more on the flex program , part of the " constantly shifting , secretive nature of amazon , " here .
