the island nation of palau is preparing for a visit from japan 's emperor akihito next week with an unusual and grim task : it 's investigating long-sealed caves on the island of peleliu to look for the remains of japanese soldiers from world war ii . the remains of six soldiers have been discovered so far , but that 's just the start . the australian broadcasting corporation reports they were found in one of about 200 sealed caves on peleliu . an estimated 10,000 japanese men were killed in a weeks-long battle with us troops during the war , and the bodies of 2,600 of them were never found . the japanese used a network of caves and tunnels during the 1944 fighting , recounts the telegraph , and largely " staged their defense " from within the caves . about 1,600 american troops were killed , but the us military blew up many of the caves ( essentially sealing the japanese within ) and eventually gained control . the six newly found bodies were found in the vicinity of an anti-tank gun , and " it 's my understanding that those [ bodies ] were the crew , perhaps the officer and his men that were manning that gun , " says one of the search officials . " a number of us soldiers died in that vicinity as well . " the task is painstaking because searchers need to guard against booby traps or the detonation of old munitions . an interesting side note from the telegraph : some 35 japanese soldiers who had been hiding in the caves surrendered in april 1947â€”more than a year after the war 's end . ( in other wwii news , anne frank likely died earlier than thought . )
