no one—but no one—likes to get killed for having sex , and as that is often the fate of male black widow spiders , the critters are evolving a mating tactic that is , anthropomorphically speaking , more than a little creepy . researchers found a startling , and slightly unsettling , mating shift in a study titled " copulation with immature females increases male fitness in cannibalistic widow spiders , " published in biology letters and translated into english as " dirty old men spiders avoid violent death , increase number of babymamas by chasing jailbait female spiders . " essentially , gizmodo notes , the males of the species have noticed that they keep getting killed when mating with sexually mature females . but if they chase young spider-skirt , the immature females are n't capable of killing them . here 's how it works : the young females ' reproductive organs are functional , but internal , and protected by an exoskeleton . the dirty old man spiders cut through the exoskeleton with their fangs , and leave a special sperm delivery in the female 's sperm receptacle . it 's a narrow window in her development , but when the female matures , she pops out the male 's spider babies . writes gizmodo : " spider sex with minors isn ’ t a rare occurrence . when the researchers went out into the field to collect immature females , they found that one-third of them had been violated in this way . " it 's an evolutionary win-win for the male , who is a ) still alive , and b ) free to go out and mate again , thereby increasing his progeny . ( here 's a graphic description of what it 's like to get bitten by a black widow . hint : not fun . )
