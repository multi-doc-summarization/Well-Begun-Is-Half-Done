the families of perry cohen and austin stephanos are living a nightmare—the 14-year-old boys are missing at sea and their capsized boat was found on sunday—but they believe the teens have the skills to survive . as the search off the coast of florida continues , family members say the boys may have crafted a flotation device using items including life jackets , an engine cover , and a cooler that were missing from their single-engine fishing boat , usa today reports . relatives and neighbors say the boys , like others in their palm beach county neighborhood , are experienced sailors and have been around boats their entire lives , reports the palm beach post . a coast guard spokesman says the search is continuing " aggressively " and the water is warm enough that the teens , who were last seen on friday , could survive for four or five days , the post reports . because of currents , search efforts are focusing on the area north of where the boat was found near daytona beach , though they could be hard to spot , the spokesman says . " when a person is in the water , you 're basically looking for the chest up , so it 's a relatively small object you 're looking for , " he says . " it 's a challenging environment . " the families have urged people from palm beach to the coast of georgia to look for clues that might have washed up , especially the yamaha engine cover and yeti cooler , nbc news reports .
