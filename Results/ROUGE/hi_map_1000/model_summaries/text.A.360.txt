ben carson will try to prove he has a handle on foreign affairs during a surprise visit with syrian refugees in jordan on friday . " i find when you have firsthand knowledge of things as opposed to secondhand , it makes a much stronger impression , " carson told the new york times before setting off for the un refugee camp in azraq on thursday . nbc news also confirmed the trip . " i want to hear some of their stories , i want to hear from some of the officials what their perspective is , " he said . " all of that is extraordinarily useful in terms of formulating an opinion of how to actually solve the problem . " he added he 'll be handing out soccer balls and beanie babies as he visits a clinic , hospital , women 's and girls ' center , and an " adolescent-friendly space . " he 's expected to return to the us on sunday . since the paris terror attacks , carson 's poll numbers have been dropping , especially in iowa where he was once leading . one quinnipiac university poll shows him down 10 points since october , perhaps due to concerns about his grasp on foreign policy . asked if voters felt he was n't the right person to lead when terrorism fears are high , carson said , " i would agree with that assessment , " but " that 's why it 's a good thing it 's a marathon , not a sprint . as time goes on they will begin to listen more carefully to what i 'm saying . " carson recently drew heat for explaining that he opposes accepting syrian refugees into the us because the result could be " a rabid dog running around in your neighborhood . " he also seemed baffled when asked to name the countries he would call to form an anti-islamic state coalition .
