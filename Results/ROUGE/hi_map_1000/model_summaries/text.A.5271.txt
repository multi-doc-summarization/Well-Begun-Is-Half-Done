most people board a plane with the goal of going somewhere . not on flamingo air , unless an orgasm counts as a destination . the cincinnati-based airline 's goal is for fliers to fulfill their dream of having sex in the sky . president and ceo david macdonald once owned a large security firm , reports priceonomics . then one day 20 years ago , he was discussing the mile high club with friends and he got the idea to create an airline to help people have sex . today , he says thousands of surprisingly " straight-laced " couples have paid for private , hour-long " flights of fancy " on flamingo—which also offers sightseeing tours and has a flight school—for a $ 495 fee . they 've included a couple celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary and a pair with eight kids who simply wanted some time to themselves . no need to maneuver around airplane seats : couples are treated to a pile of cushions where two seats should be , plus chocolates and champagne . as macdonald puts it , " you 've got ta think romance , not sex . " that 's why similar airlines have failed , he says—though the love cloud does offer " mile high club " flights in las vegas . " they all tried to sell sex , not the sizzle . " that doesn ’ t mean the flight is n't awkward . the space is cramped , there 's turbulence to worry about , and the pilot is only hidden behind a curtain , melanie berliet wrote for maxim in 2014 . " i have had a high heel in my ear once , been shot in the back of the head with a champagne cork , " macdonald , also a pilot , previously admitted , per the new york daily news . " thank god we wear headsets . " ( these celebs say they 're in the mile high club . )
