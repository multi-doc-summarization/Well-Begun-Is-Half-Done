wisdom the laysan albatross is " at least " 63 years old , experts say , making her the oldest known wild bird on the planet . and , amazingly , she 's still hatching chicks . last week , a worker at the midway atoll national wildlife refuge—wisdom 's home in the north pacific—saw the mother caring for a new chick , according to a press release . and it 's a feat she 's managed for each of the past seven years , livescience notes . for comparison , most laysan albatrosses live between 12 and 40 years , per the us fish & wildlife service . wisdom first came to the attention of researchers while incubating an egg ... in 1956 . she was tagged then , and has likely raised no fewer than 30 chicks in her lifetime . wisdom 's " ability to continue to hatch chicks during the last half century is beyond impressive " given " the threats that albatross face at sea , " says a biologist . chief among those threats : tsunamis . battered by five-foot waves in the wake of japan 's 2011 earthquake , some 2,000 adult albatrosses on midway 's islands were estimated to have died ; wisdom obviously survived . and she 's racked up many such feats , says the refuge manager . among them : she 's " logged literally millions of miles over the pacific ocean in her lifetime to find enough fish eggs and squid to feed herself and multiple chicks . " ( we noted last year that the second-oldest albatross known to hatch a chick was 61 . )
