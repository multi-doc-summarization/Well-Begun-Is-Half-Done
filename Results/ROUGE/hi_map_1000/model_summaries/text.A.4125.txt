one of the reporters who tangles publicly with president trump the most is himself in a bit of hot water over a tweet . jim acosta of cnn has apologized after tweeting " f -- - you " ( except he spelled it out ) to a critic , reports mediaite . acosta also maintains that he mistook the person as an old friend , but not everyone is buying that . it all started thursday night when acosta tweeted a complaint that the trump campaign turned up the music so loudly at a trump rally that it was difficult to work—the implication being that it was deliberate . at that point , a former aide for melania trump , justin caporale , mocked acosta with a tweet reading , " dear diary ... " that 's when acosta sent his controversial response—he did so in a private direct message , but caporale then made it public . acosta also blocked caporale . as online criticism grew , and caporale demanded an apology , acosta responded : " hey buddy i thought you were an old friend from the campaign days . i ’ m so sorry . hope i didn ’ t offend you . have a good night and take care . " as the wrap notes , the apology seems a bit odd given that acosta also blocked caporale , raising the question of why he would block a friend . neither acosta nor cnn has commented further . ( acosta also once tangled memorably with white house aide stephen miller . )
