mitt romney got booed during his speech to the naacp yesterday , but many observers on the left are saying that 's just what he wanted , reports politico . " i think it was a calculated move on his part to get booed at the naacp convention , " said nancy pelosi . pelosi would not elaborate , but lawrence o'donnell did , wondering if the speech was " an appeal to racism and racist voting , " notes mediaite . rush limbaugh , unsurprisingly , said the audience booed romney simply because he 's white . " romney goes in there today , and he sounded like snow white with testicles , " said limbaugh , claiming people in the naacp do n't understand obamacare . but rep. emanuel cleaver had a more measured interpretation of the booing , saying romney just sold his message poorly . " i felt terrible when the booing started , but i also believe that if he 's got any african-americans in and around his campaign—which i don ’ t know ; if he does , i don ’ t know any of them—if he has staff members who vetted that speech or inserted some of the things that i heard , they should be fired , " said cleaver .
