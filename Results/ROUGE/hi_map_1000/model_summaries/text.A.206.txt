like snacking on dark chocolate ? then we hope you 're not doing it to avoid milk , because the us food and drug administration tested 94 dark-chocolate bars and found milk in 61 % of them , quartz reportsâ€”including not just products with descriptions like " may contain milk " or " may contain traces of milk , " but ones that claim to be vegan , dairy-free , or lactose-free . what if the label does n't mention milk at all ? yep , the agency found milk in 33 % of those cases . of 88 bars that did n't list milk as an ingredient , 51 included milk . the fda undertook the project after consumers complained about reacting badly to dark chocolate . sure enough , it 's hard to find a dairy-free heaven in dark-chocolate land : " this can be a problem , since even one small bite of a product containing milk can cause a dangerous reaction in some individuals , " a researcher tells yahoo . the fda detected milk in 75 % of dark-chocolate products labeled " may contain milk , " " manufactured in a facility that uses milk , " or similar , and found that certain products " had milk levels as high as those found in products that declared the presence of milk , " the agency says , noting that consumers should " read 'may ' as 'likely ' " on such labels . what 's more , 15 % of dark-chocolate bars with labels reading " dairy-free " or " lactose-free " contained milk , as did 25 % claiming to be " vegan . " so what 's up ? many companies make dark and milk chocolate on the same machines : " and remember , they use a lot of powdered milk products in the chocolate industry , so powder can blow , it can get stuck to equipment , " an allergist tells cbs pittsburgh . those in dire need of milk-free dark chocolate should find " a trusted source of allergen-free chocolate , " says yahoo , which advises people to " proceed with caution . " ( if you 're not allergic to milk , though , chow down . )
