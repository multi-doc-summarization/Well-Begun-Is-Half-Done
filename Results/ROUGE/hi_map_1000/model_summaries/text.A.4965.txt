what happens in california should stay in californiaâ€”especially if what happened was someone meticulously wrapping $ 330,000 worth of thc pills , hash wax oil , and marijuana ( about 71 pounds ) like christmas presents , upi reports . instead , per an ohio state highway patrol press release , 31-year-old daniel yates apparently decided to cross state lines with these " gifts " in the trunk of a rented 2016 ford expedition , and when he was pulled over monday morning for driving too closely , a drug-sniffing police dog alerted its human colleagues to yates ' cargo . yates was charged with the felonies of possession and trafficking in drugs , which could net him up to a $ 30,000 fine and up to 16 years in prison if he 's convicted . ( a marijuana christmas tree was seized in germany a few years back . )
