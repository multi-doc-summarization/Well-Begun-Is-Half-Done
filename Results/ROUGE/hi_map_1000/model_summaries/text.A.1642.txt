the air force is testing a new stealth drone at area 51 that 's designed to penetrate " contested " areas—in other words , countries where the us is not at all welcome , aviation week reports . dubbed the rq-180 , the unmanned northrop grumman plane is thought to have better stealth design and aerodynamics than the lockheed martin rq-170 sentinel that often flew out of afghanistan ( one was apparently captured by iran ) . the air force wo n't confirm , but northrop grumman 's financial reports and area 51 's big new hangars suggest that rq-180 testing is underway . this explains how the air force is planning to improve its isr ( intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ) in " contested " areas—a problem they have admitted to before . " the mix is not where it needs to be , " said an air force isr official three months ago . " we are over-invested in permissive isr and we have to transform the force to fight and win in contested environments . " in other words , " permissive " areas like afghanistan and iraq are considered a thing of the past . so how many will the air force buy ? maybe just a few , since they 'll be expensive and harder to keep under wraps if purchased in bulk . hat tip , wired . ( see iran 's claim to its " biggest drone yet . " )
