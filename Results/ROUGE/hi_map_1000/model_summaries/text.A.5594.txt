male tigers are a lot like human men when it comes to sex . they 're shy and awkward about their bodies if they have n't spent a lot of time around female tigers . they take libido enhancers when they get older . and , if a partner their own age is n't doing it for them , they consider trading them in for a younger , prettier tiger . bbc news reports india 's alipore zoo is having a difficult time getting its 10-year-old white tiger vishal to mate . the zoo has tried vitamins and even de-worming him ; nothing seems to be working . experts are blaming the fact that vishal was born in captivity , meaning he does n't have much experience with females and might not understand the biological signals his body is sending , according to the times of india . plus , vishal is at the outer limits of breeding age for tigers . this is apparently frustrating to rupa , a female white tiger the zoo has assigned to breed with vishal . while in heat , rupa will chase , touch , and scratch vishal , but he " runs away with his tail between his legs , " a veterinary consultant tells the times . zoo staff have been trying to mate the two tigers for six months , and it 's important they succeed because the zoo 's tiger population is getting older and has n't had a birth in more than a decade . now , staff are considering trying vishal out with a much younger bengal tiger named rani , who is described as having " a very beautiful face , " the bbc reports . ouch , rupa .
