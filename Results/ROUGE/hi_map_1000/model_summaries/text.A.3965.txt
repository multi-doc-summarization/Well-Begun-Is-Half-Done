" the test has also angered china , pyongyang 's one major ally , reuters notes . it 's " hugely insulting to china , which now can be expected to follow through with threats to impose sanctions , " says an analyst . thus far , china has cited " firm opposition " to a test conducted " heedless of widespread international opposition , " the ap reports . according to south korea , seismic activity suggests the explosion measured some 6 to 7 kilotons—more than previous tests but less than the 20 kilotons detonated in hiroshima . seismic tests by several countries suggested the test , which the north called " safe and perfect , " occurred near the location of its predecessors ; the us geological survey says it was just a kilometer underground . over at the washington post , the crack staff has found the exact test site—on google maps , just off " nuclear test rd .
