president trump probably wo n't be sending out celebratory tweets about this : alec baldwin says he will indeed be back on saturday night live in the fall to reprise his presidential impersonation . " yeah , we 're going to fit that in , " he tells cnn . " i think people have enjoyed it . " however , baldwin says a busy schedule means he wo n't be appearing as trump as frequently as he did last season . he likened it to viewers getting " celery sticks " instead of a full meal . some thought his last appearance was a retirement of sorts from the snl impersonation . the news comes after spike tv taped a tribute to baldwin on sunday featuring some big names . two notable samples , via vanity fair : bill clinton : " i wouldn ’ t know an alternative fact if it hit me in the face . but i do know this : i first met alec baldwin more than 20 years ago . even before that , i was a huge fan of his work in the movies . " ireland baldwin , daughter : " i ’ m here to roast this big old ham i call my father . speaking of pigs , some of you may remember me as that thoughtless little pig that you read about . that was a decade ago , but my dad and i are in a much better place now . he would never say something like that because i ’ m 6-2 and i would kick his ass .
