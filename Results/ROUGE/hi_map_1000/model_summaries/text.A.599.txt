" he would n't be the only one ; jews are all over christmas , from jesus , mary , and joseph , to irving berlin and jule styne , who wrote " white christmas " and " let it snow " respectively . alter even talked to a rabbi who said celebrating was " not in itself a transgressive act , " for jews , as long as they 're not celebrating christ as the messiah . that 's good , because 32 % of jews have a christmas tree , a recent pew survey revealed . christmas has become a secular american holiday , like thanksgiving or the fourth of july . that 's true even for religious jews like dennis prager at realclearpolitics , whose orthodox family nonetheless watched the vatican 's mass every year . " the notion that non-christians are excluded is absurd , " he argues ; those who argue otherwise are , in his mind , secular liberals trying to divide america . " the entire society—jews , muslims , hindus , buddhists , atheists as well as christians—all benefit from the goodness and joy that the christmas season engenders .
