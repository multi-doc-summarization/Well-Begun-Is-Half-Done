fresh off his loss to mitt romney at cpac , rick santorum hit the talk shows this morning , and he 's downplaying the victory , reports politico : " you have to talk to the romney campaign and how many tickets they bought—we 've heard all sorts of things , " santorum told cnn . " ron paul has won those ( straw polls ) because he trucks in a lot of people , pays for their ticket , and they come in and vote . i do n't try to rig straw polls . " elsewhere on the sunday dial , as per politico : santorum on his chances : " i think we can do well ( in michigan ) . i think we can do reasonably well in arizona , and really make this a two-person race . " sarah palin on romney : he 's " a great candidate , " but " his idea of conservatism is evolving , and i base this on a pretty moderate past that he has had , even in some cases a liberal past . now that ’ s a problem . he ’ s still in the 30 percentile mark ... because we are not convinced . " obama chief of staff jack lew on the birth control ruckus : the friday " accommodation " is as far as the white house will go . " there are others who do n't have the same objective , they will have to speak for themselves , ( but ) this is our plan . " ron paul on 'severe conservative ' romney : " that was the first time i ’ ve heard that definition , so i guess mitt will have to tell us exactly what it means . obviously , he means he ’ s a serious conservative , and he was trying to defend himself , or portray himself as such , but i don ’ t know exactly what he was meaning by that .
