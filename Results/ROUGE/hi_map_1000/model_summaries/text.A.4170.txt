a man on death row in texas has been granted a last-minute reprieve after his lawyers successfully argued he was convicted on " junk science " regarding shaken baby syndrome , reuters reports . robert roberson , who had been scheduled to be executed june 21 , was convicted in 2002 of murdering his 2-year-old daughter . according to the ap , roberson 's girlfriend says he was angry when he became the sole caregiver of his daughter , nikki . that same day , roberson brought nikki to the hospital with serious head injuries . doctors thought they looked intentional and called police . nikki died the following day . while roberson maintains nikki was hurt falling off her bed or from a fever , experts during his trial testified that she died of shaken baby syndrome and that roberson planned to sexually abuse her . but new research shows that what used to be taken as signs of shaken baby syndrome—brain swelling and bleeding behind the eyes and on the brain ’ s surface—can also be caused by short falls or undiagnosed medical conditions . roberson 's lawyers successfully convinced eight of the nine members on the texas court of criminal appeals that roberson had been convicted on " false , misleading , and scientifically invalid testimony . " nikki never showed any outward signs , such as an injured neck , of shaken baby syndrome . roberson 's case will now go back to trial . ( this boy died 12 years after being shaken as a baby . )
