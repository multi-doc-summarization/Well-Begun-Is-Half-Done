tiger woods ' second round of the us open is over , and you will currently find his name second from the bottom on the leaderboard . which means that out of 156 golfers , he is tied for 154th place . some are still playing , and it 's possible one or two more might end up behind him , but no matter what , his 16-over-par means that he will miss the cut by a mile , reports usa today . what 's more , this is pretty much business as usual for woods these days . " at a certain point , all of the stragglers are going to let it goâ€”the hangers-on who still believe that tiger woods has a chance to regain at least some of his past glory and start playing excellent golf once again , winning a tournament here or there and maybe even another major , " writes steve silverman at cbs . those looking for a new phenom might pay attention to 15-year-old cole hammer , who is about to start his second round . it 's a long shot , but if he finished at 4-under today , he 'd probably make the cut .
