back in 1988 , mark wahlberg was just a 16-year-old troublemaker , and after trying to steal two cases of beer from thanh lam outside a massachusetts convenience store , he beat the man with a 5-foot stick and screamed racial slurs at him . the attack left lam blind in one eye , necn reports . wahlberg was convicted of assault and served 45 days , and now , more than 26 years later , he 'd like the conviction erased from his record , the boston globe reports . " since that time , i have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that i can be a role model to my children and others , " wahlberg wrote in his application to the state 's board of pardons . " i have not engaged in philanthropic efforts in order to make people forget about my past , " he continued , mentioning his own charity , as well as his support of the dorchester boys and girls clubs . " to the contrary , i want people to remember my past so that i can serve as an example of how lives can be turned around and how people can be redeemed . ... receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that i am not the same person that i was on the night of april 8 , 1988 . it would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works . " he does note that a pardon would also allow him to get a concessionaire 's license , which would help in terms of his wahlburgers restaurant chain . ( wahlberg 's latest good deed : he 'll go bald for a cancer charity . )
