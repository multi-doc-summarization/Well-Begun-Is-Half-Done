" pachyderms have lost a great champion . " that 's the tribute of one elephant expert for esmond bradley martin , one of the world 's most well-known ivory investigators , who was found killed in his home in nairobi , kenya , per the telegraph and bbc . the 75-year-old had a stab wound to his neck , and investigators believe his death was the result of a robbery gone wrong . his wife says she went out for a nature walk and discovered his body upon returning home around 4pm sunday , per the star . bradley martin , identifiable by a colorful handkerchief he often had peeking out of his jacket pocket , was a major figure within the wildlife conservation movement who 'd risen to prominence by going undercover , usually posing as a buyer , to expose the illegal market for ivory and rhino horn . a former un special envoy for rhino conservation , bradley martin began his efforts in earnest in the 1970s , when the number of elephants being slaughtered for their ivory spiked . that 's when he left the us for kenya , and his work helped put an end to the sales of rhino horn and ivory in china . his travels also took him to vietnam and laos , where last year he and another researcher revealed the latter country 's ivory trade was the fastest growing in the world . their work there involved the dangerous ploy of pretending they were buyers and staying in a casino frequented by organized-crime members and traffickers , all so they could find out what the going price for ivory was . local police say they 've already questioned a cook and gardener at bradley martin 's home and have come up empty so far on suspects .
