2013 has been a pretty unbelievable year for jorge mario bergoglio , who became pope francis , dominated facebook , and now finds himself time 's person of the year . managing editor nancy gibbs explains how he ended up on the cover after just nine months on the job : because of how he has positioned himself ( " at the very center of the central conversations of our time , " from wealth to the role of women to justice ) , for his reach in our flattening world ( " far beyond the boundaries of the catholic church " ) , and for what he has accomplished in such a short time . " something remarkable : he has not changed the words , but he 's changed the music . " gibbs acknowledges the skeptics ' likely responseâ€”that francis faces many obstacles " in accomplishing much of anything beyond making casual believers feel better about the softer tone coming out of rome while feeling free to ignore the harder substance . " but the fascination that swirls around him gives him an ability benedict xvi lacked : " to magnify the message of the church and its power to do great good . " writes gibbs , " the heart is a strong muscle ; he 's proposing a rigorous exercise plan . and in a very short time , a vast , global , ecumenical audience has shown a hunger to follow him . for pulling the papacy out of the palace and into the streets , for committing the world 's largest faith to confronting its deepest needs , and for balancing judgment with mercy , pope francis is time 's 2013 person of the year " ( cover story here ) . also , the runners-up : edward snowden , edith windsor , bashar al-assad , and ted cruz . see past winners here .
