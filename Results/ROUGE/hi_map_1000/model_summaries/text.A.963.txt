what happens when humans abandon 1,600 square miles because of radioactivity ? wildlife runs rampant , apparently . a new study on animals in the chernobyl exclusion zone shows what once looked something like a wasteland is now packed with elk , roe deer , red deer , wild boar , and wolves . researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987—a year after the chernobyl disaster—and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow , reports the guardian . they found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby ; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves . the numbers of elk , roe deer , and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former soviet union . " it 's very likely that wildlife numbers at chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident , " a researcher says in a release . " this does n't mean radiation is good for wildlife , just that the effects of human habitation , including hunting , farming , and forestry , are a lot worse . " but another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the bbc the research " only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure , rather than the vast majority of animals—most birds , small mammals , and insects—that are not directly influenced by human habitation . " and since the study did n't look at radiation exposure , it " does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction , survival , longevity , or general health of the animals surveyed . " while scientists found chernobyl 's wild boar population dipped in 1993 , they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame . ( there 's something wrong with chernobyl 's forests . )
