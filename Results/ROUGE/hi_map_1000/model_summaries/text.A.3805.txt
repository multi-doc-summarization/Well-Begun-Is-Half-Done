a female costumer on the grinder—a fox sitcom canceled in 2016 after just one season—is suing fred savage , who starred in the show alongside rob lowe , alleging harassment and even violence . but both savage and fox are hitting back strongly against the claims . youngjoo hwang says savage treated her poorly , giving her mean looks and cursing at her , and once told her he hated her and was annoyed that he had to be nice to her . she says she once brushed dandruff off his tuxedo jacket , which was part of her job—and he hit her three times in the arm while telling her not to touch him . she says he was also verbally abusive to other female crew members on the show , yelling at them not to follow him around or look at him , tmz reports . hwang says fox protected savage , and that when she reported the alleged violence to an executive producer he said , " i 'm not even sure what fred did constituted harassment and i do n't think you should report it to hr . " but fox says it looked into hwang 's claims : " we conducted a thorough investigation into these allegations and found no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of mr. savage . we will vigorously defend against these unfounded claims , " the company said in a statement obtained by deadline . page six has a lengthy statement from savage in which he says , among other things , " these accusations are completely without merit and absolutely untrue . fox conducted an extensive internal investigation into her claims , a process in which i fully participated . ... none of her claims could be substantiated because they did not happen .
