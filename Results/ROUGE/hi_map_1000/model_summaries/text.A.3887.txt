a nun says dzhokhar tsarnaev expressed remorse , while prosecutors played video of him giving the finger to a security camera . but today , secondhand narratives and hand gestures may give way to words straight out of the boston marathon bomber 's mouth during his sentencing , nbc news reports . although defense lawyers are mum , the will-he-or-won't-he question has set off a debate over whether it 's a smart idea for him to vocalize , say , his motives or apologies to victims ' families , as the los angeles times suggests . the lawyer who defended timothy mcveigh , for one , thinks tsarnaev should n't talk . " i would be very surprised if he speaks , " he tells nbc . " generally , i do n't advise clients to make a statement unless they are articulate and it ... does n't sound like it was written by lawyers . " adds another defense attorney , " i do n't think there 's anything to be gained by it at this point , " he says . " whatever would be said â€¦ would be viewed as too little , too late . " but a law school prof tells cbs that tsarnaev could take a long view : while an apology wo n't affect his sentence , it could give him leverage if he seeks to have his death sentence commuted by the president . conversely , he could use his sentencing as a platform , like zacarias moussaoui , who issued taunts at his 2006 sentencing for conspiring on the 9/11 attacks : " god curse america . and god save osama bin laden . you will never get him . " who will likely be speaking today : bombing victims and their families , who will have the chance to give impact statements , the times notes . ( tsarnaev did n't testify at his trial , but he did cry during one person 's testimony . )
