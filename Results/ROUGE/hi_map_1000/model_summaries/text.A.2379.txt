sarah palin is looking like one of the biggest non-democratic losers in the midterm elections , according to some analysts . high-profile losses among the candidates she endorsed , especially in alaska , where lisa murkowski appears bound for victory as a write-in candidate , are likely to undermine her credibility , the economist notes . it predicts that we 'll be hearing less from palin—at least until she makes her 2012 ambitions clear—as the spotlight turns to rising stars who have actually been elected , like rand paul and marc rubio . gop strategists , however , say that while palin 's " mama grizzlies " may not have been big winners , the palin brand definitely came out ahead . " she 's got the most valuable asset anybody can have in politics , and that 's name id , " republican campaign consultant ed rollins tells politico , comparing palin 's efforts in 2010 to richard nixon 's campaigning on behalf of gop candidates in 1966 ahead of his successful bid for the white house in 1968 . " no one remembers who won or lost , only that he was out there , " rollins says .
