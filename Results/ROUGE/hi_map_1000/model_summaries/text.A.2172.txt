we 'll start by tempering expectations : the breakthrough you 're about to read about has " no direct link " to a human treatment , reports afp , but it 's noteworthy nonetheless . scientists say they 've identified a molecule that " reverses " the effects of down syndrome in mice . the molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist , and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of down syndrome . the molecule , which is not approved as safe for humans , spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development . " most people with down syndrome have a cerebellum that 's about 60 % of the normal size , " says one of the johns hopkins researchers . science world report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born , at which point their cerebellums had n't fully developed . the single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum 's growth . in an added surprise , memory and learning , " which are generally controlled by the hippocampus , not the cerebellum , " were also positively affected . but the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition , and could have unintended consequences , like raising cancer risk .
