it may be true that people are a bit more generous around the holidays , but mark zuckerberg is taking that to a whole new level . facebook 's founder is once again making a hefty donation to the silicon valley community foundation : a block of facebook stock worth $ 1 billion . he gave the foundation roughly the same amount of stock last year , but it was worth only half as much at the time . it 's " by far the largest gift in our history , " the foundation 's ceo told the san jose mercury news , without providing any specifics on how the donation will be used . but it wo n't be the only stock to soon escape zuckerberg 's hands . cnbc reports he 's selling off 41.4 million facebook shares worth $ 2.3 billion ... to pay his taxes . last year zuckerberg 's tax bill rang in at $ 1 billion , but this year 's tab could be closer to $ 2 billion , an astounding sum considering that the top 400 earners in 2009 paid a total of $ 16 billion . still , even after the tax man takes his due , zuckerberg will have plenty of cash left to roll around in . he 'll still have 444.2 million facebook shares , worth around $ 24 billion , which give him about 62.8 % of the voting power of facebook shareholders , down from 65.2 % before the sale and donation .
