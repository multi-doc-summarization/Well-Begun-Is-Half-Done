when donald trump initially took flak for not challenging a questioner 's assertion that president obama is a non-american muslim , his campaign explained that he had n't heard that part of the question . this morning , however , trump himself took to twitter in a far more defiant tone : " am i morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him ? i do n't think so ! " he tweeted . then he pointed out that " this is the first time in my life that i have caused controversy by not saying something . " he reeled off three more , one asserting that president obama would n't have defended him if the situation were reversed , another saying the media would have castigated him on free-speech grounds if he had challenged the man , and another saying that christians ' " religious liberty is at stake " around the world . ( still , critics are pouncing , including the white house . )
