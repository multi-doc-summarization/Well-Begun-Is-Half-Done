the 10-year-old son of a kansas lawmaker died on the world 's tallest water slide this summer , and that ride is now closed for good . caleb schwab , the son of state rep. scott schwab , suffered a " fatal neck injury " aug. 7 on the 168-foot verruckt slide at the schlitterbahn kansas city water park ; the slide has been closed as investigators look into caleb 's death , the kansas city star reports . once the probe is done and the park gets the legal go-ahead , the slide will be " decommissioned , " with the ride permanently shuttered and the slide taken down from its tower , per a schlitterbahn statement released tuesday . " in our opinion , it is the only proper course of action following this tragedy , " the park says , adding it remains " heartbroken " over caleb 's death . it 's not clear whether the schwab family will sue or settle with the park , or if criminal charges will be filed , though the kansas city pd tells kshb charges are n't likely . in kansas , permanent amusement park rides have to undergo yearly inspections , but they can be done by private firms rather than the state , the ap reports . in schlitterbahn 's case , all of its rides received a thumbs-up in june after they received private inspections . but some people who had ridden the slide , operational since 2014 , spoke out after caleb 's death and noted they 'd had uneasy experiences on the ride , including shoulder harnesses coming loose and rafts flying into the air when they should n't . the park notes in its release that it will eventually announce what attraction will be built in verruckt 's place .
