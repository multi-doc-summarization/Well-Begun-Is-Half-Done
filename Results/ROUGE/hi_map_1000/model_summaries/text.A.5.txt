the supreme court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction , the new york times reports . the court—which is divided 5-4 for conservatives , but saw justice roberts vote liberal on obamacare and same-sex marriage—will look at cases including unions , affirmative action , and possibly abortion . a primer : unions : since 1977 , unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts , but not political ones . now california teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political . " it could set the stage for a citizens united-style reconsideration in the area of union dues , " a lawyer says . affirmative action : abigail fisher says that being white played a role in the university of texas denying her admission back in 2008 . the supreme court punted on her case in 2013 , and now it 's back on the docket . like the unions case , this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs . the death penalty : justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in pennsylvania , kansas , georgia , and florida , the wall street journal reports . justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional . " one person , one vote " : should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters ? if justices choose the latter—leaving out immigrants and children—latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain , politico reports . abortion : justices may opt to revisit a texas law that could reduce the state 's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10 . at issue is whether new clinic requirements are an " undue burden " on women 's right to an abortion . one commentator believes this supreme court session will be ugly for liberals .
