president trump 's proposed solution after the failure of the gop health care bill friday : change senate rules so that only 51 yes votes , not 60 , are needed for legislation to pass . trump has made this pitch before , though it would not have saved the gop 's health care bill overnightâ€”it managed only 49 votes , with three republicans joining democrats in voting no . trump followed up his initial tweet to acknowledge that fact , politico reports : first tweet , 9:46am : if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate , they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority , not senseless 60 ... second tweet , 10am : ... even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51 , some really good things need 60 . so many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes ... . as cnbc explains , the senate was using the budget reconciliation process to pass the repeal bill , which is why it only required a 51-vote majority . trump has called repeatedly for the senate to change the filibuster rules for all bills , but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has so far disagreed .
