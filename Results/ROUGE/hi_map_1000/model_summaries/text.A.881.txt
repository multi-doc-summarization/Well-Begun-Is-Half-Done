reality winner was charged monday with leaking a document about the russian hacking of us electoral systems . one of the most surprising things , according to nbc news , was that a 25-year-old had top-level security clearance . but apparently it 's not that unusual . most people who do nsa work involving intercepting communications and translation are just out of high school . " there are thousands and thousands of 18- to 21-year-olds doing critically important and secret work around the world , " an expert on the nsa says . many of them , like winner , are young members of the military . she served six years in the air force . a high security clearance is needed to listen in on terrorists or members of foreign governments . intelligence officials are concerned that winner is part of a growing number of american intelligence employees leaking state secrets not for money but because they feel the public has a right to know the information . the election of president trump is making people feel like they need to take action . cnn details winner 's anti-trump comments on social media . and abc news has more information on the 25-year-old , including that she speaks pashto , farsi , and dari and had recently worked as a yoga instructor , where she was known as a " reliable " employee . winner 's mother says her daughter is " very passionate about her views .
