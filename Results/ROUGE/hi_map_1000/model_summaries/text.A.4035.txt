an incredible tale of bravery may have surfaced thanks to new " pixel signature " technology applied to 14-year-old videosâ€”but it 's a complicated revelation . the new york times reports those videos , shot by overheard aircraft on march 4 , 2002 , may show air force technical sergeant john chapman fighting al-qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in afghanistan . what 's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery . it 's that chapman was supposed to be dead . he was originally there with members of seal team 6 , providing support as their radioman . in the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation , senior chief petty officer britt slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain . slabinski could n't verify the wounded chapman was dead , but he was nearly certain . so a " dead " chapman was left behind . the air force now suspects chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying army ranger reinforcements ( three rangers were among seven americans to die that day ; some say blame rests at the seals ' feet ) . the conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view . the air force secretary wants chapman given the medal of honor ; seal team 6 has no issue with that , but has n't taken a stance on whether chapman was alive . slabinski is outwardly skeptical , and suggests the air force would welcome a medal of honor , which it has n't seen one of its own get since vietnam . but a fresh look at chapman 's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive . read the full story at the times .
