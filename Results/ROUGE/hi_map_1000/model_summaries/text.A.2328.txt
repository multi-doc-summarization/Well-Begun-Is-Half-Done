freewheeling speech on twitter is n't the same as protected speech , a judge has ruled . in a decision with major repercussions for social media communication , a manhattan criminal court judge has ordered twitter to turn over tweets sent by a new york writer during occupy wall street protests last fall . judge matthew sciarrino said that while private speech is protected , the writer 's communication does n't merit the same treatment because his tweets were public , reports the new york times . the case involves writer malcolm harris , who was busted while occupiers marched across the brooklyn bridge . prosecutors demanded two days of harris ' tweets in a bid to contradict his expected defense that it was police who led protesters off the bridge walkway and into the road . twitter fought the request , and the aclu filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that prosecutors should be required to obtain a search warrant in such a case , and that the process should n't skip over the writer of a tweet to go directly to twitter . while the prosecution was delighted with the ruling , a twitter statement expressed " disappointment , " adding : " twitter â€™ s terms of service make it absolutely clear that its users own their content . we continue to have a steadfast commitment to our users and their rights . " that 's a surprise , given that twitter itself has just revealed that it complied with 63 % of 849 requests from law enforcement authorities to turn over tweets in the first six months of this year , reports the los angeles times . american law enforcement made up 80 % of those requests .
