a wall street journal reporter was fired wednesday over potential business dealings with an iranian-born arms dealer . the washington post reports jay solomon , chief foreign affairs correspondent for the journal , had received pulitzer consideration and was well-liked by the paper 's editor in chief . his shocking termination springs from an ap investigation into farhad azima , who solomon used as a source for stories . azima , who has dealt weapons to multiple nations and was tied to the iran-contra affair , offered solomon a 10 % stake in a company called denx . while it 's unclear if solomon ever accepted that stake , the ap uncovered 18 months of emails and texts between solomon and azima discussing business together . in 2014 , solomon texted azima : " our business opportunities are so promising . " the following year , azima wished solomon luck " on his first defense sale " in regards to delivering a proposal to uae representatives . also in 2015 , there was talk of denx being involved in an effort to bring down the government of kuwait , though solomon denies any knowledge of that . " mr. solomon violated his ethical obligations as a reporter , as well as our standards , " politico quotes a statement from the journal as saying . the newspaper says it was " dismayed " by solomon 's actions and " poor judgement . " solomon , while denying ever getting into business with azima , says he understands " why the emails and the conversations i had with mr. azima may look like i was involved in some seriously troubling activities .
