apple appears to have decided that it does n't make a lot of sense for the company to be tougher on marijuana apps than 23 state governments are on marijuana . isaac dietrich , co-founder of pot-themed social network massroots , tells the san francisco chronicle that apple has decided to allow his app back in its app store , as long as it 's restricted to the states where marijuana is legal , at least for medicinal purposes . the app had been in the store since july 2013 , but it was yanked in november along with dozens of other marijuana-related ones , the chronicle reports . dietrich started an online petition last month to have the massroots app reinstated . " we 're a social network for cannabis that enables people to talk about the plant in ways most people do n't feel comfortable on other social networks , " he told adweek . " i do n't want grandma to see me taking bong rips on facebook . " in a blog post , massroots thanked the cannabis community for its support . the company says it now has " a duty to show the world that cannabis consumption can be done in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with state laws and federal enforcement guidelines " and will strengthen its own compliance even beyond what 's required . ( maybe apple will now stop refusing to spell-check " marijuana . " )
