donald trump was criticized saturday for taking a " self-congratulatory " tone in the wake of tragedy . again . nba player dwyane wade 's cousin nykea aldridge was killed when she was hit by a stray bullet while pushing her baby in a stroller friday in chicago , cnn reports . on saturday , trump tweeted : " dwayne wade ’ s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in chicago . just what i have been saying . african-americans will vote trump ! ” hours later , he corrected the spelling of wade 's name , according to cbs news . an hour after that , trump tweeted condolences to the family , as well as his " thoughts and prayers . " he went on to call wade a " great guy " during a rally saturday in iowa . trump was widely accused of crassly exploiting a tragedy . actor don cheadle was particularly outspoken , calling trump " truly a pos " and requesting he " die in a grease fire . " tim kaine also called trump out for the tweet , saying sympathy is the " only reaction that is appropriate right now . " a recent poll showed trump with only 1 % support among black voters . the new york times reports he 's been trying to change that by talking about how bad life is for black people in the us and asking , " what the hell do you have to lose ? " many saw saturday 's tweet as a sequel of sorts to when trump tweeted " appreciate the congrats " following the massacre at an orlando gay club .
