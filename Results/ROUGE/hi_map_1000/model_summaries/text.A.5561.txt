paul krugman has long derided the " confidence fairy " : a notion that government cuts will somehow spark more consumers and investors to buy . we 're seeing another version of that fairy now , after learning that mitt romney , at his infamous " 47 % " fundraiser , also claimed that his election would offer an economic lift " without actually doing anything , " thanks to " optimism about the future of the country . " instead of offering much in the way of policy specifics , romney is " declaring , in effect , ' i am the confidence fairy ! ' " krugman writes in the new york times . romney 's wrong : for one thing , " business investment has actually recovered fairly strongly since the official recession ended . " what 's more , as the election has recently appeared to turn in president obama 's favor , " markets are up , not down , with major stock indexes hitting their highest levels since the economic downturn began . " of course , " romney ’ s whole campaign has been based on the premise that he can become president simply by not being barack obama . why shouldn ’ t he believe that he can fix the economy the same way ? " click for krugman 's full column , or over at the washington post , ezra klein breaks down romney 's tax plan and finds it would raise taxes on those he defines as middle-income .
