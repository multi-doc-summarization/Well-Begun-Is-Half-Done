a free willie nelson concert in the heart of the lone star state seems like something that would attract fans of all political stripes , but there 's a good chance the sept. 29 event will feature a largely left-leaning crowd . that 's because the country crooner is headlining a " turn out for texas " rally in austin for beto o'rourke , the democratic challenger to gop sen. ted cruz , and many of nelson 's fans are n't happy about it , ktrk reports . per austin360 , it 's " the first public concert nelson has held for a political candidate , " the singer 's publicist says in a release , though rolling stone notes he 's put on private concerts for politicians in the past . " my wife annie and i have met and spoken with beto and we share his concern for the direction things are headed , " nelson says in the release . " beto embodies what is special about texas , an energy and an integrity that is completely genuine . " the site notes nelson even brought o'rourke out on stage during his fourth of july concert . none of this pleases nelson 's more conservative fans , who see his ties to o'rourke as a " breaking point , " per the washington post . " i am certain you 've lost your mind , " one commenter wrote on nelson 's facebook page , while another noted : " willie 's position is proof positive that marijuana use over time kills brain cells . " still others are dumping already purchased tickets to future nelson shows . many , however , applauded nelson 's decision . " so glad you are involved in this good cause . i have always been a fan , and am now a bigger fan , " noted one well-liked post . the post notes nelson has long been politically active , throwing his support behind barack obama , hillary clinton , and bernie sanders , and advocating for pot legalization , gay marriage , and the environment .
