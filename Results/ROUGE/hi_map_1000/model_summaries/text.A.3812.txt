one lucky museum will be getting a treasure trove in the form of hundreds of items belonging to civil rights icon rosa parks . a foundation run by howard buffett , son of warren , has purchased the items—including a postcard from martin luther king jr. and a hat parks may have worn when she made history for refusing to give up her bus seat in montgomery , alabama—and intends to donate them to a soon-to-be-chosen museum or institution . " i thought about doing what rosa parks would want , " buffett tells the ap . " i 'm only trying to do one thing : preserve what 's there for the public 's benefit . " the collection of more than 1,000 items also includes clothing , lamps , and parks ' presidential medal of freedom . all have been gathering dust in a new york warehouse as family and friends battled over parks ' will . " i doubt that she would want to have her stuff sitting in a box with people fighting over them , " says buffett . he did n't disclose what he paid , but an attorney for parks ' heirs says the price was $ 4.5 million . in less-happy news , copper thieves this week ransacked the alabama apartment where parks lived , the ap reports separately .
