astronomers have discovered a planet where a certain red guy with horns could make himself right at home . it 's a planet much like our own earth—about the same size , with the same mixture of rock and iron , and it orbits a star like our sun—except that kepler 78b is an infernal ball of fire . located less than a million miles from its host star—that 's 1 % of the distance between earth and our sun—its temperature ranges between 3,500 and 5,000 degrees fahrenheit . that 's " well above the temperature where rock melts , " an astronomer tells the new york times . " this is probably one of the most hellish planets that have been discovered yet . " at 400 light-years from earth , the exoplanet was first spotted by the kepler spacecraft but astronomers on earth took a closer look at its light frequency to discover its orbit and mass . the findings , published in two studies in nature , show a planet that tightly orbits its sun—which from the surface would look 80 times larger than our sun—in just eight and a half hours . adds an expert , per livescience : " this planet is an enigma . it could n't have formed in place because you ca n't form a planet inside a star . " but while astronomers are baffled as to how the planet got there , they 're fairly certain it shows friendlier earthlike planets are still out there .
