think deforestation is declining in the amazon , with all the warnings about climate change ? nope , it just got worseâ€”its highest rate in the past 10 years , the bbc reports . brazil has released data showing that roughly 3,050 square miles ( or nearly 1.5 million football fields ) of earth 's biggest rainforest was chopped down between august 2017 and july 2018 , a 13.7 % increase over the year before . opinions differ on the cause , with environment minister edson duarte blaming illegal loggers : " an upsurge in organized crime " is behind it , says duarte , who calls for a broader battle against " environmental violations and in defense of sustainable development of the biome . " then there 's a 2012 forest code that still gives amnesty to anyone who deforests on small properties , notes the guardian . after declining for years , deforestation began rising in 2013 and increased in four of the following years . now brazil is welcoming a new , openly anti-environmentalist president , jair bolsonaro , whose foreign minister calls global warming a marxist plot . environmentalists say the amazon rainforest could suffer a 300 % deforestation surge under the new regime : " we are already in a very critical situation in terms of climate change , " an environmental researcher tells national geographic . " if we mess up with the amazon , carbon dioxide emissions will increase so massively that everyone will suffer . " bolsonaro , a 63-year-old former military officer , wants more roads and mines in the rainforest and fewer penalties for chopping down trees . ( a scientist calls the decline in forest insects " hyperalarming . " )
