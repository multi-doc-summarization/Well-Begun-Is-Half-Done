a man who sounds a lot like polish foreign minister radek sikorski does n't mince words about his feelings toward the us—and his fellow poles—in a boozy , secretly recorded backroom chat obtained by polish magazine wprost . the man the magazine identifies as sikorski says the " polish-american alliance is n't worth anything . it is even harmful because it creates a false sense of security , " the ap reports . we are " suckers , total suckers , " the man continues . " the problem in poland is that we have shallow pride and low self-esteem . " the magazine shook polish politics last week with the release of a recording of the country 's interior minister and the chief of the central bank discussing how the bank could help the governing party win elections this year . the new recording—apparently made before the ukraine crisis—drags the scandal into foreign policy at a critical time and the magazine says it will release full transcripts today , reports the new york times . the magazine , which says the recordings were obtained from a businessman , was raided last week by prosecutors who tried to seize the editor-in-chief 's laptop . the government later admitted there had been " legal deficiencies " and the raid should never have happened , the bbc reports .
