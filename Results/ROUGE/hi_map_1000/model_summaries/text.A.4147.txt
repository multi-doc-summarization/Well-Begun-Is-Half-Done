apparently google 's self-driving cars have yet to learn how to evade cops . one of its bubble-shaped autonomous vehicles was pulled over during a traffic stop in mountain view , calif. , on thursday , though it managed to avoid a ticket , reports nbc news . an officer spotted the vehicle traveling 24mph in a 35mph zone , with traffic backed up behind it , police say , per the san jose mercury news . " the officer stopped the car and made contact with the operators to learn more about how the car was choosing speeds along certain roadways , " authorities say in a blog post , noting " it was lawful for the car to be traveling on the street . " according to the california vehicle code , the cars can operate on roads with speed limits of 35mph or under . however , " we 've capped the speed of our prototype vehicles at 25mph for safety reasons , " google self-driving car project explains . " we want them to feel friendly and approachable , rather than zooming scarily through neighborhood streets . " the project notes " people sometimes flag us down when they want to know more about our project , " but " after 1.2 million miles of autonomous driving ( that 's the human equivalent of 90 years of driving experience ) , we 're proud to say we 've never been ticketed ! " ( apple is working on its own self-driving cars . )
