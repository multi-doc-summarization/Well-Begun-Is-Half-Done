for nearly 40 years , the death of natalie wood has remained a mystery . first the 43-year-old actress was ruled to have died of accidental drowning after disappearing from a yacht she was on with husband robert wagner and actor christopher walken . then , in 2012 , that ruling shifted to drowning plus " other undetermined factors , " with la county sheriff 's department investigators suspicious there was more to the case . wood 's sister , lana wood , has contended for years that wagner was responsible for her sibling 's death , and this week , dr. phil mcgraw added oxygen to that theory by having lana wood and the yacht 's captain , dennis davern , on his show for two days of interviews on the subject , usa today reports . " you believe robert wagner murdered natalie wood ? " mcgraw asked davern , who 'd initially stuck with the accidental drowning story . " yes , i really do , " davern answered . he says he heard wood and wagner fighting , and when the noise ceased , he went up on the deck to find wagner standing there solo ; davern says wagner insisted they say wood likely slipped and fell into the water . lana wood sticks by that , too . " are you suggesting that [ wagner ] knocked her out and threw her in the water ? " mcgraw asked . " something like that , absolutely , " she answered . per us weekly , lana wood also recently appeared on a podcast in which she says that , shortly after her sister 's death , hollywood exec rowland perkins informed her wagner was keeping her out of tinseltown . " he said , 'stop trying to get a job in production or acting . you 've been blacklisted by robert wagner , " lana wood said . a rep for wagner , now 88 , tells usa today that davern and lana wood are " despicable human beings " and that " they should be ashamed of themselves .
