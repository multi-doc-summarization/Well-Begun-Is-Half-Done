residents of the milky way , meet z8_gnd_5296 . that 's the not-so-great name of a newly discovered galaxy that just happens to be the most distant—and thus oldest—ever spotted , reports cbs news . scientists say it formed a mere 700 million years after the big bang , and it could shed further light on how the universe came to be . the bbc adds this little mind-bender : " because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the universe to us , the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago . " not mind-bending enough ? try this from the washington post : " we ’ re looking 95 percent of the way back to the big bang . to put that into human terms , that would be like an 80-year-old watching a video of himself on his fourth birthday . " the discovery comes courtesy of images taken by the hubble telescope and follow-up analysis by astronomers at the keck observatory in hawaii . one weird quirk of the galaxy : it produces stars at a much faster clip than our own , a trait that might have been more typical in the early days of the universe . so can we go even further back ? in principle , yes , explains national geographic , but we 'll need bigger telescopes .
