william hager watched his 78-year-old wife , carolyn , suffer from medical problems , including arthritis , for 15 years . but when the couple could no longer afford her medication , an ominous idea popped into his head , per cnn . authorities say hager , 86 , called police around 1pm monday , allegedly telling responding deputies , " i have bad news . i shot my wife at 7:30 this morning . i want to apologize i did n't call earlier . i wanted to tell my kids what happened first , " reports wpbf . he said he shot his wife in the head as she slept because she previously said she wanted to die , was in pain , and could n't afford medication , per an affidavit . " he felt that he was at a point that this was his only course of action , " says the chief deputy in port st. lucie , fla. hager was booked in st. lucie county jail and charged with first-degree premeditated murder . a neighbor tells wptv that carolyn hager had complained about " excruciating " back pain a few days earlier , but " they seemed like such a nice couple â€¦ so it was quite a shock . " another neighbor says she faced a similar situation when her husband could n't afford his medication and asked her to shoot him , but she could n't . " he suffered so badly and there 's nothing you can do , " she says , noting prescription medications should be more affordable . the hagers filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and william took a job at sears to help pay for carolyn 's medications ; it is n't clear if he knew a local clinic helps people pay for medications not covered by insurance .
