lethal injection is just such a pleasant way to die . at least according to florida state rep. brad drake , who wants to put an end to the execution method in the state . he argues that death row killers should n't be allowed to " get off that easy " ; the electric chair would be more appropriate he saysâ€”as would a firing squad . drake this week filed a bill that would put an end to lethal injection and give convicts facing death the choice of the latter two , reports the ap . " i think if you ask a hundred people , not even talking to criminals , how would you like to die , if you were drowned , if you were shot , and if you say you were put to sleep , 90 % of some of the people would say i want to be put to sleep , " says the republican , who apparently equates lethal injection with taking a permanent nap . " let 's put our pants back on the right way , " drake urges , adding that his proposed switch would force death row inmates to think about their punishment " every morning . " and they 'd be getting off easy , because , as reported by the florida current , if it were up to drake , " we would just throw them off the sunshine skyway bridge and be done with it . " mediaite notes that keith olbermann is not a fan of the idea . ( click for another odd political push in florida . )
