a white-collar crook is facing extra prison time for having his son shoot him in the legs with a 20-gauge shotgun , the bbc reports . shannon egeland , 43 , was already facing 10 years for taking part in a vast mortgage-fraud scheme when he had his 17-year-old son shoot him by a road in caldwell , idaho , in an attempt to avoid prison . " the psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable , " us attorney scott bradford wrote in a sentencing memo . back in 2009 , egeland was co-owner of an oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $ 20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle . facing prison , egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs . egeland told police he 'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver , but investigators got suspicious when his pricey bmw , his wallet , and his cellphone were n't taken , the idaho statesman reports . then they learned about his recent insurance , and the whole thing unravelled . now egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast . bradford called him a " self-absorbed , opportunistic narcissist , " the oregonian reports , but egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment . " what bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him , " he says . " if i could take it all back , i would , but i ca n't . that will haunt me the rest of my life . "
