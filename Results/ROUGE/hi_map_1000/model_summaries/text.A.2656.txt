hikers on the pacific crest trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes , extreme fatigue , and—these days , at least—traffic . " you can ’ t talk about the pacific crest trail without mentioning the crowds , " pete brook writes for outside . he should know : brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile pct , which runs from the mexican border through california , oregon , and washington to the border with canada . but do n't take his word for it : the pacific crest trail association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail . to put things in perspective : 300 people attempted to complete the entire pct in 2006 , according to the ap , with about 120 of those making it . in 2014 , 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail . more traffic means more stress on the land , more improperly disposed of poop , and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue . so what 's with the increase in traffic over the past few years ? you can thank cheryl strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture wild . after the book came out in 2012 , there was a small increase in interest in the trail , the pcta 's jack haskel told the ap in 2015 . but after the movie , starring reese witherspoon , was released in 2014 , interest in the pct exploded . " millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired , " haskel said . strayed , more or less unprepared for the journey , hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons . " however for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude , things might not turn out so well , " writes donthikelikewild.org . " our advice to would-be hikers : grow a spine first . then get out there and hike the pct . " ( this female hiker is the " biggest badass you 've never heard of . " )
