if the booming sales were n't enough to convince you that greek yogurt is a thing , try this : starbucks wants in . the company plans to start selling the yogurt in its stores next spring , and then start stocking supermarket shelves around the country after that , reports the wall street journal . it will be sold as as " evolution fresh , inspired by dannon , " a reflection that starbucks is teaming with dannon parent company danone . evolution fresh is the name of the starbucks juice line already being sold . why greek yogurt ? it probably has something to do with the fact that us sales jumped 48 % to $ 2.65 billion in the year ending june 8 , reports bloomberg . but one analyst thinks the starbucks move toward becoming a " house of brands " is a risky one . “ when you start to get too diverse with your portfolio , investors just have a hard time characterizing what you are , ” he says . “ are they a house of brands or are they about beverage experiences ? ” ( maybe starbucks can help figure out what to do with the nasty byproduct that results from the making of greek yogurt . )
