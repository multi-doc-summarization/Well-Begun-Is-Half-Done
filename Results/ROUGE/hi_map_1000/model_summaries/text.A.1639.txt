president trump says he wants congress to have a deal on immigration and the border ready by the time he returns from the davos forum in switzerland—and he says he is open to the deal including a path for citizenship for daca recipients . " we 're going to morph into it , " trump said of citizenship for the dreamers on wednesday , per the washington post . " it ’ s going to happen—over a period of 10 to 12 years . if somebody 's done a great job and worked hard , it keeps the incentive to do a great job , " he said . " i think it 's a nice thing to have the incentive , after a period of years , of being able to become a citizen . " trump stressed , however , that the deal for roughly 700,000 dreamers would depend on securing $ 25 billion to build a border wall and $ 5 billion for other immigration-related spending . he said reporters could tell dreamers they had " nothing to worry about . " the proposal trump outlined sounds similar to one that senate minority leader chuck schumer said was " off the table " after the shutdown ended , the hill notes . gop sen. lindsey graham , who has been pushing for a bipartisan deal—and using the hashtag # trumpdreamers—called trump 's remarks a " breakthrough . " " i truly appreciate president trump making it clear that he supports a path to citizenship for daca recipients , " said graham , whose own proposals have been called " unacceptable " by the white house . advocates for restricting immigration say they could support a pathway to citizenship , depending on how many people it applies to and whether it is combined with other measures to limit immigration , the los angeles times reports .
