welcome to obamacare 's website woes , part two : the spanish version . americans who visit cuidadodesalud.gov to enroll for obamacare say it 's slow , has links to english-speaking pages , and poor translationsâ€”like using " prima " for " premium " even though the spanish word is commonly used for " female cousin , " the ap reports . " when you get into the details of the plans , it 's not all written in spanish , " says a health care navigator who helps people enroll in miami . " it 's written in spanglish , so we end up having to translate it for them . " so attempts to enroll spanish-speakers seem to be flailing so far ( the exact numbers are n't in ) and critics are pouncing ; hot air calls it yet another " grandiose " obamacare promise that falls " tremendously , incompetently flat . " but the obama administration notes that spanish speakers have been able to use phone and paper options to enroll . and that may suit some hispanics better , according to an nbc news report on health care among low-wage , spanish-speaking workers near silicon valley . many of them say they have no internet connection and would n't feel comfortable handing over personal information online .
