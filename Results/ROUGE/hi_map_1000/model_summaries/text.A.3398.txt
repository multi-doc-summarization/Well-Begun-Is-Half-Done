president trump was on twitter sunday morning defending his eldest son and taking aim at two of his favorite targets : hillary clinton and the media . in a series of posts starting around 6am , trump wrote , " hillaryclinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son don is being scorned by the fake news media ? " and : " with all of its phony unnamed sources & highly slanted & even fraudulent reporting , # fake news is distorting democracy in our country ! " donald jr. came under scrutiny last week after releasing emails confirming he took a meeting last year with a russian lawyer promising damaging information about clinton , politico reports . that meeting has raised more questions about collusion between the trump campaign and the russian government . president trump also tweeted a " thank you " message to former campaign adviser michael caputo " for saying so powerfully that there was no russian collusion in our winning campaign . " on friday , caputo told cnn that he " never once " heard anyone in the campaign discuss russia . " no one ever breathed the word 'russia ' to me , " he said . " the idea that somebody at that campaign would have had the forethought and the treachery ... or the resources to go out and do this is laughable . " caputo , who resigned from the trump campaign last june , has strong ties to russia , advising then-president boris yeltsin 's re-election campaign and doing pr work for a media company owned by vladimir putin 's government . caputo 's interview was conducted before donald jr. released his emails .
