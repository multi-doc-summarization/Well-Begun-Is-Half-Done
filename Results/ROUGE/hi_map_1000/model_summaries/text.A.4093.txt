puerto rico is still in great need of hurricane relief supplies , as san juan 's mayor noted last week , which makes recent news out of florida frustrating . the orlando sentinel reports that boxes of donated supplies meant to be sent to the island after hurricane maria remained stuck instead in a kissimmee government office , and that a recent rat infestation has now contaminated some of the food , water , and other supplies that were left languishing . the office of the puerto rico federal affairs administration , which its executive director says is situated in an " old " and " deteriorated " building , could n't move the materials to their intended destination due to budgetary issues related to shipping . carlos mercader says attempts to recruit other groups to help them send the supplies were " unsuccessful . " a previous chief of the prffa is outraged by the wasted donations . " every day , those employees would go into that office and saw those boxes and they did nothing , " says juan hernandez mayoral , who is also a former puerto rican senator . " this is government negligence . " newsweek notes this news comes on the heels of a contract canceled by fema after a one-woman company failed to deliver millions of meals to puerto rico as promised ; democratic lawmakers now want the house oversight and government reform committee to subpoena fema to find out how that small company got the $ 156 million contract to perform that service . meanwhile , mercader says his team is trying to assess which supplies are still good and will then get them out to puerto rican evacuees living in central florida .
