good news : a mathematical model has been created that could help save your life in the event that your city is hit by a nuclear bomb . scientist michael dillon 's model , published tuesday , is about reducing radiation risk from the bomb 's fallout , and calculates " optimal shelter exit time . " the longstanding advice has been to immediately seek shelter , ideally underground , if a bomb hits . but there is better and worse shelterâ€”the latter being " lightweight " buildings ( such as ones made of wood ) or ones without basements ; the afp reports more than 20 % of us homes fall into the worse category . here is dillon 's determination for people living within 20 miles of a low-yield nuclear blast , meaning one a bit smaller than hiroshima : if it would take five minutes or less to reach better shelter ( that concrete basement , or the center of a large building , like a big office , reports livescience ) , bypass the more immediate shelter and go there straight away . if better shelter is 15 minutes away , stay in the worse shelter for up to 30 minutes , then head out . as for the transit period , do n't waste time worrying about protecting your body from the radiation , he says , which can mostly be rinsed off once you get to your shelter . the findings are actually intended for emergency planning officials , who can make use of the findings when designing " an optimal low-yield nuclear detonation response strategy , " writes dillon , who works at california 's lawrence livermore national laboratory .
