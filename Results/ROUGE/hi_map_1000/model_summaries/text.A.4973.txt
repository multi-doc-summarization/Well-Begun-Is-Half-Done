the body of richard oland—the sixth generation of canada 's oldest beer dynasty—was found on the floor of his office with nearly four dozen wounds in 2011 , the cbc reports . according to vice , it appeared someone had used a hammer to " break apart the bones in his face , " and there was so much blood it seeped through three layers of flooring into an office below . the defense for the beer magnate 's 47-year-old son dennis—who has been charged with his murder—rested its case this week , the cbc reports . money is suspected to have played a part in the killing . according to vice , dennis was hundreds of thousands in debt and owed more than $ 500,000 to his millionaire father alone . after richard 's death , dennis inherited leadership positions in three companies and a $ 150,000 payout . the cbc reports dennis continued to maintain his innocence during testimony this week while acknowledging discrepancies between his testimony and a 2011 police statement . for example , dennis—who was the last person to see his father alive—originally told police he was wearing a different jacket than he was when he saw richard the day before his body was found . the jacket he was actually wearing had three bloodstains on it matching richard 's dna . he blames the differences on shock and nerves during his interview with police . the oland family , which founded moosehead breweries , has rallied around dennis and says he is innocent . jurors are scheduled to reconvene on dec. 14 to decide that for themselves . ( money was also suspected when this us man was charged with murdering his missing parents . )
