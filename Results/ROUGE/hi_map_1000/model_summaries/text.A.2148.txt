politics can be rough stuff , but for one west virginia senate candidate it got downright violent . authorities say retired army officer richard ojeda , a democrat running in tuesday 's primary , was brutally beaten by a man wearing brass knuckles at a political cookout on sunday , the ap reports . per the washington post , jonathan porter , 41 , was arrested and charged with malicious assault for the attack , which left ojeda—who 's known porter since they were kids—with multiple head and face fractures and a concussion . and while officials are n't sure what the motive was , ojeda thinks he knows . " this was premeditated and there was a reason the guy did this , " he wrote sunday on his campaign 's facebook page . ojeda , who has been campaigning against the region 's corruption and poverty , adds , per nbc news , that " the moment you start asking questions , you become public enemy number one . " per the state journal , ojeda says porter approached him at the cookout , asked for a bumper sticker , then attacked . " as i 'm kneeling down putting the bumper sticker on [ porter 's truck ] , that 's the last thing i remember , other than … coming to where my head 's on a tree stump and i 'm spitting blood , " ojeda says . witnesses say after the beating , porter hopped in his truck and tried to run ojeda over before bystanders stopped him ; porter then fled , surrendering a few hours later . ojeda , 45 , tells the state journal he 'd received menacing phone calls recently , including one that said , " you 're going to wind up dead floating in the guyandotte river . " but the man described in a facebook post as " tough as woodpecker lips " says he 's dealt with al-qaeda and the taliban and writes he 's " now even more dedicated to the cause . this does n't scare me . " porter has also been charged with malicious attempted assault and felony destruction of property . ( voting in west virginia ? no selfies in the booth . )
