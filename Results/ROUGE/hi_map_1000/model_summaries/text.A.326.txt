baby boomers with cash and a campy bucket list take note : movie director john waters is hosting a summer camp for grown-ups in connecticut . while the first iteration , slated for the third weekend in september , is already marked " sold out " ( there were 300 slots ) on the camp john waters page , dreamers of a follow-up will note that the $ 499 price of admission grants attendees access to a one-man show by waters , a q & a , a marathon viewing of his films , bloody mary bingo , hairspray karaoke , and more , reports dazed . guests also receive an autographed copy of his book make trouble , which costs less than $ 10 on amazon and may be some consolation for the fact that alcohol is not included . waters , who just turned 71 , is known for such cult classics as pink flamingos , cecil b. demented , and polyester . his camp marries what art news calls " two of the more absurd developments in contemporary leisure " â€”celebrity-based getaways and " a sort of developmental purgatory " that finds adults signing up for nostalgic recreation such as kickball leagues . even so , there are at least 300 adults who thought this was a great idea . ( millennials can also sign up for adulting classes . )
