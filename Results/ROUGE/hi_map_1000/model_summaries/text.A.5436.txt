with polls showing him in trouble on the eve of israel 's election , prime minister benjamin netanyahu disavowed his support for a two-state solution with palestinians and immediately reversed his political fortunes . with his victory less than two days old , he has already backtracked , reports the jerusalem post . “ i have n't changed my policy , " he tells andrea mitchell of msnbc in an interview that airs this evening , as quoted in the new york times . " i don ’ t want a one-state solution . i want a sustainable , peaceful two-state solution , but for that , circumstances have to change . " netanyahu says his comments before the election—in answer to a question , he said there would be no two-state solution under his watch—were more a reflection of how things had changed on the palestinian side in recent years . “ i was talking about what is achievable and what is not achievable , " he said . " we have to have real negotiations with people who are committed to peace. ” critics had accused him of pandering to right-wing voters to avoid defeat . in the msnbc interview , netanyahu also denied that his last-minute video warning supporters that arabs were voting " in droves " was an attempt to whip up anti-palestinian sentiment , reports cnn . " i was n't trying to suppress the vote , " he said . " i was calling on our voters to come out . " the original two-state comment in particular had irritated the white house , which warned it was re-evaluating its relations with israel .
