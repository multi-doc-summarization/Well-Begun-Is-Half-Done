it 's a specific health warning for a specific group of people : if you smoke , drink alcohol , and also happen to drink tea , let the latter cool down before you drink it . failing to do so might raise your risk of esophageal cancer , suggests a study in the annals of internal medicine by chinese researchers . the idea is that hot tea ( or , presumably , any hot beverage ) can damage cells in the esophagus and make it more vulnerable to the damage caused by cigarettes and alcohol , the lead researcher tells the telegraph . how hot is too hot ? the researchers did n't specify , but cnn notes that previous research on hot beverages pegged the danger zone at 149 degrees fahrenheit and above . " irritating the lining of the esophagus could lead to increased inflammation and more rapid turnover of the cells , " explains a national cancer institute investigator who was not involved with the study . " alternatively , hot liquids may impair the barrier function of the cells lining the esophagus , leaving the tissue open to greater damage from other carcinogens . " the observational study was a massive one , following nearly 500,000 chinese adults ages 30 to 79 for about a decade . those who drank hot tea and either smoked or used alcohol , but not both , also saw an increased risk of cancer , though it was n't as great , reports time . and hot tea alone did not carry a significant risk increase .
