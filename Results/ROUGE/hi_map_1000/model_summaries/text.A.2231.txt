the white house hosted a " made in america product showcase " monday , and one of the attendees was matt roberts , president of the last us manufacturer of forks , spoons , and knives . that his sherrill manufacturing from upstate new york snagged an invite to the event was n't a surpriseâ€”but syracuse.com reports that roberts soon spotted an anomaly in the state dining room . everybody had just eaten with flatware made from china . the utensils were made by oneida ltd. , which once manufactured its products in new york , but no more . in fact , roberts ' company now uses a former oneida plant . " with all of the things going on in the world , forks and spoons in your kitchen are not exactly the top priority at the white house , " says roberts . but the story suggests that might soon change . it notes how new york congresswoman claudia tenney has been pushing for the white house to make the switch , once even getting an assurance of it from president trump himself ( see the video ) . while trump was n't at monday 's event , two of his top economic advisers , wilbur ross and peter navarro , were in attendance , as was tenney , who was making sure they knew the full story .
