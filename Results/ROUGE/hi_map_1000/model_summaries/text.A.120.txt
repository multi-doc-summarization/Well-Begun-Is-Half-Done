a rarity in the weight wars : an fda advisory panel gave the green light today to a diet pill that could become the first such drug to hit the market in more than a decade . the fda is expected to make a final decision next month on contrave , though it generally follows the advice of its panels . made by orexigen therapeutics—whose shares were soaring , notes bloomberg—contrave has what medpage today describes has " modest " weight-loss effects . panel members thought the benefit outweighed potential side effects such as high blood pressure . contrave is a combination of two drugs already on the market : bupropion , an antidepressant also used to quit smoking , and naltrexone , which is used to treat addictions to alcohol and painkillers . one pharmacy professor tells medpage today he 's sure it will be a huge success initially . " time will ultimately tell if it is a good drug or not , " he adds . " in the meantime , i 'm going to let somebody else be the first to take it . "
