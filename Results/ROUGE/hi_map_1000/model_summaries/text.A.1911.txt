a private banquet dinner , a reality-tv star , and a tweet showing a nazi salute have placed a dc italian restaurant in the center of controversy . maggiano 's little italy hosted a dinner friday for a group that had a conference in dc the next day , apparently without knowing the group was the national policy institute , known for its white nationalist members , washington city paper and the washington post report . how the restaurant became clued in : a protest against npi that formed at the eatery , followed by dinner attendee tila tequila sending out a tweet showing herself and two men performing the nazi salute along with the caption " seig [ sic ] heil ! " tequila 's twitter account was suspended monday , twitter confirmed to buzzfeed , though it did n't elaborate . maggiano 's posted on facebook monday the dinner had been a " last minute booking " and that npi had used a different name on the reservation . the restaurant also railed against tequila 's tweet , saying , " this expression of support of hitler is extremely offensive to us , as our restaurant is home to teammates and guests of every race , religion , and cultural background . " it says it 's donating all profits from friday 's sales— $ 10,000—to dc 's anti-defamation league . the tab caught up to tequila at the airport , where she claimed she and her photo mates were " just trolling everyone , " adding , " i think it 's so funny to get a rise out of people who are so easily triggered by things like that .
