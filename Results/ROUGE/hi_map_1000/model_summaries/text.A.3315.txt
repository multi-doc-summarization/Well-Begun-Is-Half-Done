amid nationwide protests against police brutality , effigies of three black people hung by their necks turned up on uc berkeley campus in northern california yesterdayâ€”but was it racism or politically inspired art ? " we are unsure of the intent , " a school spokeswoman tells the ap . the effigies , one female and two male , had the names of lynching victims on them and the dates when they were killed . one effigy with the hashtag # icantbreathe was named after laura nelson , who died by lynching in 1911 , fusion reports . ( see a tweeted photo of an effigy here . ) " it certainly could have been racially motivated , so we 're taking it very seriously and are very interested in finding out who did this , " another school rep tells usa today . no one has claimed responsibility , and police are investigating . meanwhile , people are debating whether the effigies are designed to support or terrorize protesters . " this is racial terror they are experiencing , " an on-campus berkeley pastor tells the oakland tribune . " these images strewed across campus have terrorized my students . " but others call it " guerilla art " reminiscent of public enemy 's 1992 single , " hazy shade of criminal , " the cover of which showed two lynching victims . " to me this suggested a really powerful public art installation " that connects lynching , " state violence against black folks , " and the " situation that we 're faced with around police brutality and these non-indictments , " a berkeley black studies professor tells the san francisco chronicle . hundreds of protesters marched yesterday in berkeley , without incident , under minimal police presence . ( protests there last weekend led to violence and six arrests . )
