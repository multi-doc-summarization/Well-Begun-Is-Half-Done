the united nations ' cultural body is on the trail of christopher columbus ' flagshipâ€”and it says the wreck that an expedition identified as the santa maria earlier this year is a different , much younger ship . as predicted by authorities in haiti , unesco experts say there is " indisputable proof " that the wreck found off the country 's north coast is from a much later period than 1492 , reports the bbc . unesco says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of columbus ' first voyage , and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest . unesco says it believes the wreck may lie " under coastal sediment " in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area . marine archaeologist barry clifford , who first investigated the wreck 11 years ago , says columbus-era lombard cannons spotted in the area are crucial pieces of evidence that now appear to have been looted from the site , the independent reports . " the lombards are the smoking guns and , in my view , the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the santa maria , " he says . ( columbus wrote about the 1492 sinking of the santa maria in his journal , but one historian believes that the explorer lied about the ship 's fate as part of a spy plot . )
