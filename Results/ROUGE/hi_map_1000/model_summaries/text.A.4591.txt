sequester politics have taken a weird turn . joe biden is now the subject of a spate of negative-sounding headlines because he is n't returning part of his salary in solidarity with federal workers about to be furloughed . ( see this headline at cbs news or this one at reuters . ) president obama has said he will do so—though critics are calling him a cheapskate—as have others , including chuck hagel , john kerry , janet napolitano , and jack lew . biden , though , is conspicuously absent . the vp 's office says he might change his mind if members of his own staff lose pay , reports politico . " the vice president is committed to sharing the burden of the sequester with his staff , " says the statement . why the reluctance , especially for a potential 2016 candidate ? one possible reason is that biden is a man of relatively modest means , with a net worth figured to be under $ 1 million , notes the national journal . “ it is a more difficult calculus for members who are not as wealthy , ” says a senior democratic senate aide .
