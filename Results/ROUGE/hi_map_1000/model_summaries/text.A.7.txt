israel launched a round of airstrikes on gaza today , wounding two militants and eight bystanders , including some children . israel says the attack was retaliation for a round of palestinian rockets fired yesterday , which palestinians say were in response to another israeli airstrike earlier in the day , reuters reports . more than 470 rockets have been fired from gaza since june , but this was the first time hamas acknowledged responsibility . as usual the rockets failed to harm anyone , though one did kill some goats at a petting zoo . the incident comes in the wake of a drone flight into israeli airspace this weekend , which some have speculated came from iran . an iranian military official today boasted that the incident proved that israel is vulnerable , and that its anti-missile defense system " does not work and lacks the necessary capacity . " but he denied that the drone was made by iran , saying such accusations represented a " psychological operation " on israel 's part . " the zionist regime has many enemies , " he said . iran , meanwhile , is blaming israel for a hack attack on its oil rigs .
