people have been calling for it for years , and mark zuckerberg said at a company town hall meeting today that a " dislike " button is finally coming to facebook . " people have asked about the 'dislike ' button for many years , and probably hundreds of people have asked about this , and today is a special day because today is the day that i actually get to say we are working on it , and are very close to shipping a test of it , " zuck said , per cnbc . the concept is tricky , he explained , because " we do n't want to turn facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people 's posts , " as they do on , for example , reddit . " that does n't seem like the kind of community that we want to create : you do n't want to go through the process of sharing some moment that was important to you in your day and have someone 'downvote ' it . " what people " really want is the ability to express empathy , " he said , per mashable . " not every moment is a good moment . ... if you are sharing something that is sad , then it may not feel comfortable to 'like ' that post . " zuckerberg says facebook expects to start testing soon , then launching a wider roll-out . as mashable notes , the move could have big implications : " when a dislike button becomes a reality , companies and users would have to radically shift the strategy of what they post . " and as the verge notes , " facebook does n't want people using 'dislike ' as a way to harass or disrespect other people , and—more cynically—you can argue that it certainly does n't want people disliking the sponsored posts that companies pay to put in your news feed . " indeed , zuck said back in december that any such button would have to be " a force for good , not a force for bad . "
