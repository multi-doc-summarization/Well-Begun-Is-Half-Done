" the ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the american economy , " says berkshire hathaway ceo warren buffett , and he has teamed up with some equally huge names in an attempt to go after said tapeworm . amazon.com , berkshire hathaway , and jpmorgan chase on tuesday announced that they 'd be creating a company tasked with coming up with technological solutions that can cut health-care costs for their hundreds of thousands of us employees . " our group does not come to this problem with answers , " buffett notes—nor , reports the wall street journal , with details on how much it plans to spend , where the company 's hq will be , or how many of its own employees would be impacted— " but we also do not accept it as inevitable . " what the companies ' leaders did reveal is that the new company will be " free from profit-making incentives and constraints . " " the healthcare system is complex , and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty , " says jeff bezos of amazon , per cnbc , which notes the three companies employ a total 1.1 million workers , though that figure is not exclusive to the us . the ap reports it 's unclear whether the trio would welcome other companies into the effort , but it does flag this line from jpmorgan 's jamie dimon : " our goal is to create solutions that benefit our us employees , their families and , potentially , all americans . " but they 're not exactly benefiting wall street at the moment : pre-market trading was unkind to health care companies , with the ap noting they represented eight of the 10 down companies on the s & p 500 .
