after her comments about getting dissed by a racist saleswoman at a chichi swiss boutique , oprah winfrey is , well , trying to be switzerland—sort of . " i 'm really sorry that it got blown up , " she said last night . " i purposefully did not mention the name of the store . i 'm sorry that i said it was switzerland . " but , while she says " it 's not an indictment against the country or even that store , " she 's not walking back her contention that racism was involved , reports the ap . " it was just one person who did n't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag . " the aforementioned saleswoman denies that racism was even in the same room , reports the daily mail . " it is absolutely not true that i declined to show her the bag on racist grounds . i even asked her if she wanted to look at the bag . " further , she says that the brouhaha , which she likens to a " cyclone , " has made her feel " powerless . " over at the wall street journal , james taranto dismisses the whole thing , saying , " what winfrey construes as a racial episode is actually a story about class—a wealthy , privileged celebrity aggrieved by a lowly saleswoman 's lack of deference .
