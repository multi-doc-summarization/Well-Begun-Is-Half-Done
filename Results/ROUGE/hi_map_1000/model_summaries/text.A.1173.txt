boil-water advisories are n't all that uncommon , but this one might have flint residents feeling like they 're the butt of a cosmic joke : a water main break has prompted the city to warn people to boil their water before drinking it . as cnn notes , this mostly applies to those using city water through filters installed on their taps in the wake of the lead crisis . but " residents not using a filter are asked to flush the water for at least seven minutes before collecting to boil , " adds the detroit news . the break resulted in a drop in water pressure that may have allowed bacteria into the system . as a headline at fark succinctly puts it , " residents are being told to boil the water before they not drink it . " ( the mayor is promising that new pipes are in the works . )
