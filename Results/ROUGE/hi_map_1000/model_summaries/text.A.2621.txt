the future is now , people ! ever since marty mcfly donned self-lacing shoes in back to the future , people have been dreaming about sporting a pair of their ownâ€”because , you know , tying laces sucks . nike has finally brought the dream to life , reports the verge . the company has announced a power-laced shoe called the hyperadapt 1.0 , which uses a sensor in the sole to read your foot position , then automatically tightens with a series of battery-operated pulleys , per wired . you can adjust the fit with buttons on the sides of the shoes , which will learn your preferred setting after a few wears . but that 's just the beginning . nike shoe designer tinker hatfield suggests a more automatic version of the shoe that uses biometric data to sense the perfect fit could be on the way . " would n't it be great if a shoe , in the future , could sense when you needed to have it tighter or looser ? could it take you even tighter than you 'd normally go if it senses you really need extra snugness in a quick maneuver ? that 's where we 're headed , " he says on nike.com . the yet-to-be-priced shoes will be available in three colors around the holidays , but only for nike+ members . the downside ? you 'll have to charge them every two weeks .
