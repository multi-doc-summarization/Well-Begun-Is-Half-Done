oliver stone 's the putin interviews , a four-part documentary for which the director got " extensive access " to the russian president between july 2015 and february 2017 , airs on showtime june 12-15 , and bloomberg got early access to the first two episodes . bloomberg notes that they offer " little that 's new " about putin , but that does n't mean there are n't interesting moments , such as putin being shown working out on an exercise machine , feeding a horse , or playing ice hockey . three notable quotes : no bad days : " i am not a woman , so i don ’ t have bad days . i am not trying to insult anyone . that ’ s just the nature of things . there are certain natural cycles . " on whether he 'd shower in a submarine next to a gay man : " well , i prefer not to go to the shower with him . why provoke him ? but you know , i ’ m a judo master . " on the prospect of a war between nuclear superpowers : " as of today a missile shield would not protect the territory of the united states . nobody would survive . " reviews for the documentary are varied , with many criticizing stone for seeming to encourage putin instead of challenging him . foreign policy says the documentary " somehow manages to both spout the kremlin line and fall back on the laziest american clichés about russia , " while the daily beast calls it a " wildly irresponsible love letter " to putin . but other outlets are not so critical ; variety , for example , says it 's " a surprisingly intimate set of conversations " that creates " a destabilizing portrait " of putin . ( putin was also recently interviewed by megyn kelly . )
