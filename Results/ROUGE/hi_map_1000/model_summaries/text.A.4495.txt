the former editor-in-chief of the new york review of books—who abruptly left his post after running an essay by # metoo villain jian ghomeshi—has given an interview with a dutch publication blaming his downfall on twitter and university publishers , the guardian reports . " as editor of the new york review of books i published a theme issue about # metoo offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media , " says ian burama of the oct. 11 issue , which actually focuses on modern male struggles and female empowerment . " and now i myself am publicly pilloried . " he also blames academic advertisers who were unhappy about the ghomeshi piece . " university publishers , whose advertisements make publication of the new york review of books partly possible , were threatening a boycott , " says burama . " they are afraid of the reactions on the campuses , where this is an inflammatory topic . because of this , i feel forced to resign ... " but the head of the association of university presses says he 's unaware of any such boycott threat , the washington post reports . and with the review keeping mum , most commentators and critics are slamming burama for giving an alleged serial assaulter such a highly regarded platform . " one of the biggest and most valuable pieces of currency journalism has is credibility , " an associate professor in canada tells ctv . " if you 're going to throw it under the bus , do n't be sad when you do n't have an audience . "
