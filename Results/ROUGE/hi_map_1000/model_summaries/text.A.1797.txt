richard grenell 's job as mitt romney 's foreign policy spokesman lasted all of about two weeks . grenell had been a source of controversy on two fronts : he was openly gay , which rankled some conservative commenters , and he had issued a long trail of tweets before taking the job that mocked not only callista gingrich but prominent democratic women , including rachel maddow and hillary clinton . the right turn blog at the washington post broke the news and says grenell was " hounded " from the job " by anti-gay conservatives . " ( it cites this national review column as an example . ) but politico says grenell 's " off-color and massively off-message tweets " also played a role , as does cnn . grenell statement : " ... my ability to speak clearly and forcefully on the issues has been greatly diminished by the hyper-partisan discussion of personal issues that sometimes comes from a presidential campaign . " but he made a point to thank romney for his " clear message to me that being openly gay was a non-issue for him and his team . " romney camp : “ we are disappointed that ric decided to resign from the campaign for his own personal reasons . we wanted him to stay because he had superior qualifications for the position he was hired to fill . ”
