unnamed officials say tsa officer gerardo hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes at lax before being taken to an ambulance . for 28 of those minutes , alleged shooter paul ciancia was in police custody , though officers had n't yet declared the area safe to enter . officers checked on hernandez , who was just 20 feet from an exit , then moved on while paramedics waited 150 yards away , the ap reports , noting it 's not clear if immediate attention might have saved hernandez 's life . now under review : the conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter , and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier . while an officer who checked on hernandez about 5 minutes after he was shot told numerous officers he was dead , the ap reports that it 's not known whether that officer had the training needed to make that determination ; no first-aid was administered . " i basically think there 's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport . that lack of coordination may have led to something that should n't have happened , " an lax employee says . " we may be talking about officer hernandez as a survivor . " the results of the investigation could be months away , the ap adds . ciancia was on tuesday upgraded from critical to fair condition at ucla medical center .
