senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is aiming to hold a vote on the senate 's version of obamacare repeal-and-replace legislation next weekâ€”despite the fact that many gop senators have n't seen it yet , let alone said they will support it . insiders tell the wall street journal that although mcconnell can only afford to lose two republican votes , he wants to wrap it up before the july 4 recess so the chamber can move on , and he is gambling that the pressure will make it easier for the gop to reach a consensus . the journal notes that if the bill fails to pass before the recess , lawmakers returning home could face " pressure from constituents . " the bill is being crafted behind closed doors and sources tell politico that the text should be ready this week , giving lawmakers around a week to review it before the vote . in contrast , the chamber debated the obamacare bill for a month in 2009 . the hill reports that mcconnell has focused on winning over moderate republicans , though conservatives in the house say the bill will die there unless the senate keeps provisions including the phasing out of obamacare 's extra medicaid funding by 2020 . " it 's close , " says gop sen. richard burr . " everybody 's been counting [ votes ] since the beginning . it 's been close since the beginning . " democrats have slammed the gop for failing to hold hearings , and plan to " embarrass the heck out of republicans , who are as much in the dark as we are about their own leadership 's plans on the bill , " says democratic sen. richard blumenthal . minority leader chuck schumer warned monday that democrats will delay senate business unless the gop allows open debate on the legislation .
