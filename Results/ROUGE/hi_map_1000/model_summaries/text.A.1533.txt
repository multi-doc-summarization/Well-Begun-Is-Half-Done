in what may be the best french innovation since kissing and/or toast , the country has given its workers the right not to check work emails while at home . the independent reports the new " right to disconnect " law takes effect sunday for companies with more than 50 employees . the law requires those companies to clearly define the hours when employees are n't required to check or reply to work emails , according to the bbc . supporters of the law say employees feel obligated to deal with work emails after hours but are n't being paid for that overtime . france 's labor ministry says it wants to stop citizens from working these " hidden hours . " prior to the new law , many french workers were n't sure when they were legally allowed to ignore work emails . the resulting obligation to constantly deal with work emails could lead to increased stress , problems sleeping , relationship troubles , and more . “ what we find is that people who feel they have to respond to emails on their off hours become emotionally exhausted , partially because they can ’ t detach from work , ” the new york daily news quotes a professor involved with a us study that found checking work emails at home kept people from recharging at the end of the day . the right to disconnect law was the only new labor law passed in france this last may that did n't lead to strikes and protests .
