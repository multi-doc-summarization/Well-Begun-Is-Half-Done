cassie young is used to strangers reaching out to her on social media . the 31-year-old is a digital director at the nationally syndicated radio program the bert show in chicago , and she 's got more than 14,000 followers on twitter alone . but when a personal trainer offered to whip her into shape after she announced her engagement to her boyfriend of nearly a decade , he became so persistent—and their chat so emotional—that she posted their exchange on facebook , where it went viral . " if you think of life as a 'game ' with being skinny as how you 'win , ' this guy is offering to play by the rules and get you there , " she writes . " i 'm telling you the game is bogus . you do n't need the game . i reject the game . i refuse to play . " young tells yahoo that , since she was first teased about her size in 5th grade , it 's taken years and many yo-yo diets to love the body she has . but the trainer—whom she wo n't name , saying that " no one should be vilified because they 're ignorant " —told her that if she did n't hire him she should hire someone else because " those pictures last centuries " and her children 's children would see what she looks like , per mashable . " this guy tried to undo the work i ’ ve done and plant a seed of doubt in my head during my engagement , " she says . she replied to him , " i 'll look my best because i 'll be so happy i get to marry the man i love . " she says the positive comments she 's received from readers mean a lot , and that life is " too short to be spent worrying about a belly roll . " ( people recently tweeted memories of the first time they were body-shamed . )
