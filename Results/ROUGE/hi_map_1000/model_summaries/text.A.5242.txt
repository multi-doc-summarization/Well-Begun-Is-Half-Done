for years , the los angeles zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them . on thursday , that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the california supreme court that animal activists are decrying . a los angeles county superior court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty . but in what the los angeles times calls a " highly technical ruling " overturning the injunction , the state 's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit ( which uses civil law rules ) ca n't be used to address criminal conduct . the taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an la resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants , also including the use of chains and drugs , courthouse news service reports . a lawyer who worked on the case , for free , for more than five years says he 'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo , or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling . " i thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the supreme court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the dark ages , " he says . the supreme court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way , the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt . the barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in california , and for its part , the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants , and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned .
