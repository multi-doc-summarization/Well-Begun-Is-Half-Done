pope francis delivered a simple simple message to latin american bishops in brazil todayâ€”if you 're going to help the needy and keep people from straying from the church , you 've got to get outside and actually meet them : " we can not keep ourselves shut up in parishes , in our communities , when so many people are waiting for the gospel , " he said . " let us courageously look to pastoral needs , beginning on the periphery ( of where we live ) , with those who are farthest away , with those who do not usually go to church . they , too , are invited to the table of the lord . " the speech drove home " a critique of elitism that has become the overarching theme of his first overseas trip , " writes the wall street journal , while usa today sees it " as yet another admonishment ... for catholics to adopt a more missionary mindset . " after speaking to the region 's bishops , francis addressed politicians , business leaders , and intellectuals , and urged them to reach out to all members of society , too . " when leaders in various fields ask me for advice , my response is always the same : dialogue , dialogue , dialogue , " he said , per usa today . " it is the only way for individuals , families , and societies to grow , the only way for the life of peoples to progress . "
