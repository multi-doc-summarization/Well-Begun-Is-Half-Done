" these are all a recipe for avalanche creation . " indeed , an avalanche warning was in effect at the time . the japan times and guardian report the ski season had closed last week at the nasuonsen family ski resort ; the students who arrived saturday were about two-and-a-half hours away from the conclusion of monday 's climbing event when the avalanche struck near the upper part of the slope . nbc news specifies that the weekend event was a " mountain climbing safety training exercise .
