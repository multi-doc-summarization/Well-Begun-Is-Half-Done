what would you do if you had a tongue as long as a playing card ? for 18-year-old adrianne lewis , making youtube videos showing off the various tricks she can do with her estimated 4-inch-long tongue seemed like a great way to gain some internet fame . the michigan teen uploaded her first video two years ago . since then , she 's uploaded about a dozen videos showing off all she can do with her quirky mouth feature , including licking her nose , touching her tongue to her elbow , and , with a little help from her hand , even licking her own eyeball . speaking to barcroft tv , her mom says they realized lewis ' tongue was unusually long when she was about 10 , and notes that her daughter comes from a long line of long-tongued people : her great-grandfather , grandmother , and mother share the trait . while lewis is psyched about the hundreds of thousands of views her youtube videos have amassed , boyfriend tim hegedus notes , " it 's the internet , so there 's a lot of weird people there . i 've seen some comments that make me uncomfortable . " more fame could come : the length of lewis ' tongue might just be enough to get her into guinness world records . while she has n't had it officially measured by the guinness folks , she estimates her tongue measures at least 4 inches , which mashable reports could be enough to beat the 3.97-inch-long tongue ( as measured " from its tip to the middle of the closed top lip " ) currently holding the record .
