friends driving by your house and honking a friendly hello : cool . city and county officials and employees honking for almost 10 years as they drive by to get back at you for placing a bid on a house : not so cool . per courthouse news service , that 's the claim of ohio resident garrick krlich 's lawsuit filed thursday against the city of hubbard , trumbull county , and hubbard 's police chief , all of whom krlich says " intentionally turned a blind eye " to an orchestrated campaign to " harass , intimidate , terrorize , and retaliate against him , " mainly via the car-honking . why krlich says he 's the object of retaliation : in 2007 , he tried to buy at an auction a neighboring property that for nearly a century had been in the family of the town 's fire chief at the time . krlich says when he put in the highest offer , then-fire chief john clemente jr. told him he 'd better take it back or risk being " bitter enemies . " krlich kept his bid in , though for unspecified reasons , the property " did not pass to him as it should have " —and , he says , the harassment started anyway . described on the krlich.com website ( subtitled " small town terrorism " ) as " undeserved , uninterrupted , unyielding spite , " the subsequent actions krlich says have been directed toward him—the relentless honking , an unsympathetic police department , a 911 service that hangs up on him—have been carried out by various hubbard firefighters driving city trucks , members of police chief james taafe 's family , city councilmen , and others , per the suit . in a 2014 20/20 interview , krlich says the honking peaked at 100 times a day ( it 's since died down to just a couple per day ) ; clemente and his wife noted in the same interview that krlich was simply litigious . " if you beep your horn one time , he 'll take you to court , " marlene clemente said .
