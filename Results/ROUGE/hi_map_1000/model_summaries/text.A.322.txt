an australian man is dead after walking nearly 29 miles on a steaming hot , lonely outback road . the unidentified 60-year-old and a female companion were driving to the windidda station cattle ranch near the remote town of wiluna when their car broke down on sunday , police say . the pair camped overnight , hoping to flag down a passing car . when none had come by early monday , the man began the 30-mile trek to windidda with just a " small container of water , " the ap reports . he did n't return a day later , so the woman set out after him . she was found yesterday by workers from the nearby wongawol station , who took her to her destination , abc news reports . her companion had not arrived . workers began a search and discovered the leonora man 's body on the side of the road , a little over a mile from windidda , police say . it is n't clear when he died . though a coroner has yet to determine the cause of death , police say there are no suspicious circumstances ; temperatures reached 106 degrees in wiluna on the day he began his journey . police are now reminding outback travelers to pack plenty of food and water and to stick by a vehicle if they get lost or are unable to continue as vehicles are far easier to spot from the air than humans , wa today reports . ( the story of a boy who spent nine weeks in the outback has a happier ending . )
