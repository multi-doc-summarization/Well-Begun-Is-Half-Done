the tax overhaul in the works has drawn controversy over possible changes to 401 ( k ) plans and deductions for homeowners , but another , lower-profile topic has emerged as a sore point . the house plan unveiled last week would eliminate a one-time tax break for families that adopt children . the break can be a substantial one—it 's $ 13,570 in 2017 , which can take the sting out of adoption costs that can approach $ 40,000 if done through an agency , per the hill . the issue has become a flash point on the right because conservatives equate the credit with supporting pro-life , pro-family values . " being pro-life means being pro-adoption , " tweeted gop sen. ben sasse . " congress must remember this as we work through the details of tax reform . " now the washington post highlights a different wrinkle : the house 's top tax writer has two adopted sons . rep. kevin brady , chair of the house ways and means panel , has called his adoptive kids the " biggest blessing , " but he defends the credit 's elimination . it 's " not working , " he tells the post , saying that some families ca n't claim it because they do n't pay enough in taxes or do n't itemize . a piece at vox notes that the credit is indeed " nonrefundable , " meaning that parents who do n't make enough to owe federal taxes are n't eligible . those in the middle or upper-middle class , making between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 , claim the credit the most . brady argues that tax overhaul will help all families in a more general sense by , say , increasing the child tax credit . still , expect the issue to remain contentious . congress " may end up funding planned parenthood while abolishing the adoption tax credit , " writes david french in the conservative national review . " that ’ s intolerable . "
