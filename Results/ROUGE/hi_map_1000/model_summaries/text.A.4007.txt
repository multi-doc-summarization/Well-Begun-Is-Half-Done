more than half a century before aids even had a name , the hiv virus was already spreading across africa via the city now known as kinshasa , researchers say . in the 1920s , the city was leopoldville , capital of the belgian congo , and scientists say a " perfect storm " of conditions caused the pandemic to emerge , the bbc reports . the fast-growing city was full of transient male workers who visited prostitutes , researchers say . sexually transmitted diseases were rife , and unsterilized needles at health clinics also helped spread the disease , according to a study published in the journal science . researchers studied hiv 's genetic code as well as historical documents . the researchers note that strains of hiv have been transmitted from primates to humans at least 13 times , but only one has caused a global epidemic . they believe a key factor in the 1920s spread was the congo 's booming transport network early last century , which saw a million people travel through kinshasa every year on the railways alone , reports reuters . researchers say the disease was at first confined to specific groups of people , but it started to spread into the general population and around the world after 1960 , the guardian reports . it took genetic research to track the pandemic back to its source because the disease hits the immune system , meaning victims died from any of a wide variety of infections , making the spread of hiv before it was identified hard to track through medical records , says the lead researcher , an evolutionary biologist . ( hiv has infected 75 million people , but un officials say real progress is being made and the epidemic could be over by 2030 . )
