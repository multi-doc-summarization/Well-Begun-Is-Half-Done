remember in june when it got too hot for planes to take off in phoenix ? a new study suggests stories like that will become quite common in the not-too-distant future . via reuters , the study published in climatic change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades . the problem centers around the wings ’ capacity for lift , which is lessened in warmer conditions . by 2100 , worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees fahrenheit . to safely take off , airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day , with 10 % to 30 % of planes affected . full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel , cargo , or passengers , per a release at eurekalert . think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane . " our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost , " one of the study ’ s lead authors says . wired reports that among the airports studied , new york ’ s laguardia and washington ’ s reagan-national fared poorly because of short runways , as did dubai international airport , where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55 % of the time during peak temperatures . better news : new york 's jfk would n't be much affected . delayed departures wo n't be the only hassle . scientists say severe turbulence would become more common . “ i ’ ve yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation , ” says atmospheric scientist paul williams , who believes it ’ s high time for the airline industry to prepare and adapt .
