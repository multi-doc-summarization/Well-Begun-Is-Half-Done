the coming-of-age indie flick the way , way back has been compared to little miss sunshine and adventureland . starring steve carell , allison janney , and toni collette , it 's certainly got the acting chops to make it a hit—but is it a hit with critics ? the consensus is yes , even though it does n't offer viewers anything new . it 's expected but charming , with a few laughs thrown in the mix , too . " the film is awash in safe choices , from indie-pop-accompanied montages to sitcom one-liners and black-and-white characters , " liam lacey writes at the globe and mail . though he compares the plot to that of little miss sunshine , he argues the way , way back is " way underdeveloped . " betsy sharkey at the la times appears to have been watching a different film entirely . she says the flick has a " witty , heartwarming , hopeful , sentimental , searing , and relatable edge . " though she admits it 's a " fairly straightforward story of coming of age in a time of divorce , " the writers " make it feel fresh . " it 's a " minor pleasure , " as opposed to a " major work , " concedes ty burr at the boston globe . but is n't that nice during the summer ? " this one goes down like a popsicle on a hot day , " even as it moves along " genially if not always freshly . " sure , " there 's nothing strikingly new or different about the way , way back , " writes andrew o'hehir on salon . " it 's classic summer counter-programming , a low-tech indie comedy driven by its strong cast and eccentric characters . " but it 's done well , and it stays away from " raunchy teen-movie cliché " territory . o'hehir liked the film enough to make it salon 's " pick of the week . "
