politico has an interesting article on what it 's calling " the democrats ' wage problem , " a major takeaway of which is that the average american income has actually gone down during obama 's years as president . the median household income in 2014 was more than $ 1,600 lower than it was in january 2009 , according to census data . and while a recent survey says median household income is finally above its 2009 level this year , it 's barely 1 % above it . politico calls this " one of the biggest weaknesses in the obama economic recovery " and says it could be a big problem for hillary clinton since she was part of the administration . however politico reports none of that is to say republicans know how to fix stagnant wages or have even shown themselves able to capably address the issue . “ it ’ s a bit awkward if republicans are talking about the need for wage growth and opposed to a minimum wage increase , " one political scientist tells politico . only one gop presidential candidate—rick santorum—has a proposal to raise the national minimum wage , and it 's more modest than similar proposals from any of the democratic candidates . the majority of the other republican candidates favor fixing stagnant wages through tax cuts and deregulation , policies that only exacerbated the problem under george w. bush . read the full story here .
