if you 're trying to land a job , it 's much better to explain why you 're the perfect candidate in person than in an email , a new study suggests . and it 's got nothing to do with power suits—it 's all about your voice . employers are more likely to rate people as intelligent if they hear their pitch than if they read it , say researchers at the university of chicago booth school of business . in their experiments , the researchers had students prepare videotaped pitches for their dream companies . evaluators rated the applicants more highly if they listened to the audio rather than reading the same words in a transcript , the researchers write at phys.org . watching the video did n't seem to affect the scores at all . " in addition to communicating the contents of one 's mind , like specific thoughts and beliefs , a person 's speech conveys their fundamental capacity to think—the capacity for reasoning , thoughtfulness and intellect , " says lead researcher nicholas epley . in the tests , " intellect was conveyed primarily through voice , " perhaps through subtle variances in pitch and cadence , writes wray herbert at the huffington post . he thinks it backs up that age-old advice about the importance of wrangling face time with a potential boss . or as a post at counsel & heal puts it , " work on your voice to get your dream job . " ( in other voice research , a study finds that lousy singers can improve—by singing more . )
