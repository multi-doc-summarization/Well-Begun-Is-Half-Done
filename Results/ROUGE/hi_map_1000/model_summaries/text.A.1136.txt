no kegs , strictly enforced guest lists , and at least three " sober and lucid " monitors is the new normal for fraternity and sorority parties at the university of virginia . president teresa sullivan yesterday announced the changes to the university 's fraternal organization agreement and said the school would lift a ban on social events—but only if groups agree to the new safety regulations , the ap reports . each chapter has until jan. 16 to sign off on the new regulations , adds the washington post.the university had instituted the ban after a november rolling stone article ( since found to have " discrepancies " ) alleged that a student had been raped at a 2012 frat party and that university response had been lacking , reuters notes . the new rules maintain that one of the sober monitors—all of whom must wear a label identifying them as such—must be posted where alcohol is being served , while another is required to keep tabs on any staircases leading to bedrooms and have " immediate key access to each room " of the fraternity house , the post notes . premixed drinks or any other " common source of alcohol " ( including kegs ) is prohibited ; beer can be doled out in unopened cans , but wine can be poured and served only by a sober monitor . and that 's if guests make it into the party : under a section titled " eliminating discomfort and chaos : entry management " is a mandate for a hired security guard at the entry door to check guest lists during " tier i " events ( larger parties ) ; a frat member can monitor the list during smaller " tier ii " events . ( a slate columnist came under fire for linking rape to women 's drinking . )
