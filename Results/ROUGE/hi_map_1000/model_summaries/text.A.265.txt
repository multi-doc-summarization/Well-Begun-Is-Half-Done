an appellate court ruling today means that women in rural texas may have a long drive on their hands if they plan to get an abortion . the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the state 's new rules , which essentially require clinics to have hospital-level building codes , reports the dallas morning news . ( think room and doorway sizes , air-sterilization systems , etc . ) prior to today 's ruling , the state had 17 abortion clinics—down from 40 in 2013—but only seven of them currently meet the requirements . an eighth , in mcallen near the mexican border , was granted limited exemptions . barring a move by the supreme court , the state can begin enforcing the new rules in about three weeks , reports ap . except for mcallen , those that would remain open are in major cities . a woman in el paso would have to make a 1,300-mile round trip to san antonio or cross the border into mexico , and the ap notes the court found the latter option ok. " although the nearest abortion facility in texas is 550 miles away from el paso , there is evidence that women in el paso can travel the short distance to santa teresa ( in mexico ) to obtain an abortion and , indeed , the evidence is that many did just that , " the court wrote .
