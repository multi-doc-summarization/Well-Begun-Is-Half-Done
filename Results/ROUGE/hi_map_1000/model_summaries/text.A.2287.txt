toronto mayor rob ford is battling a rare and aggressive form of cancer , but he says he 's trying to stay optimistic , even though doctors have given him a 50/50 chance of survival . " some nights i just cry myself to sleep , but what can you do , there 's only that many tears that can be shed , " he told reporters yesterday , saying the hardest part was telling his two children about it , the globe and mail reports . " the kids , it 's ripping my heart out , " said ford , who began chemotherapy for liposarcoma last month and whose brother doug has taken his place in the city 's mayoral race . ford , whose father died of cancer in 2006 , describes the disease as the " worst event " in a turbulent life . " a lot of the stuff that i 've gone through , most of it 's been self-inflicted , but when you get hit by cancer , that 's not self-inflicted , " he said . but ford is still running for the city council seat he held for 10 years before becoming mayor , even though he might be too sick to take part in any debates . one of his 13 rivals for the seat , financial planner andray domise , tells the toronto star that ford is being " highly irresponsible " by staying in the race when he is too ill to campaign . " he 's put his name on the ballot and asked to be treated as a serious candidate , so the least that i can do is respect that wish . which also means holding him accountable , " domise says . but ford has a big lead , and another opponent , community developer luke larocque , tells the star he has no problem with ford staying in the race as long as people want to vote for him . " because i believe strongly in democracy , i would have a difficult time saying he should n't run until he gets well . it 's a personal decision of his , " he says .
