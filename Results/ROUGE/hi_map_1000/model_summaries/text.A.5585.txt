a comment from mitt romney on health insurance is making waves , especially among critics on the left . speaking to the columbus dispatch editorial board ( in all-important ohio ) , romney sought to convey the notion that sick people would n't be left high and dry with the repeal of obamacare . his quote : “ we don ’ t have a setting across this country where if you don ’ t have insurance , we just say to you , ‘ tough luck , you ’ re going to die when you have your heart attack . no , you go to the hospital , you get treated , you get care , and it ’ s paid for , either by charity , the government , or by the hospital . we don ’ t have people that become ill , who die in their apartment because they don ’ t have insurance. ” it 's that last part getting the most attention : white house : if romney understood middle-class struggles , " he wouldn ’ t claim that no one in this country dies because they don ’ t have health insurance when , in fact , experts estimate that 26,000 people die prematurely every year because they don ’ t have coverage . " see the hill for more on that . thinkprogress : emergency rooms do n't cut it as a last resort . " hospitals may treat patients for emergency medical conditions regardless of legal status or ability to pay , but patients with chronic conditions that don ’ t require emergency interference are often unable to access needed care , " writes rebecca leber . she cites a study putting the yearly death toll as a result at 45,000 . the note blog at abc news thinks romney might have actually shifted his position on pre-existing conditions in the interview , and the week has more background and context on romney 's statements .
