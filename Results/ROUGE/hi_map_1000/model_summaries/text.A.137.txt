mcdonald 's is being sued for allegedly appropriating the work of a deceased graffiti artist without his estate 's permission , consumerist reports . according to artnet , dash snow , who went by the tag sace , was known for spray painting high-profile locations like the brooklyn bridge and even clothes being worn by homeless people . he died in 2009 at the age of 27 . years later , mcdonald 's redecorated hundreds of its locations with a graffiti motif , fox news reports . a lawsuit filed monday by snow 's former girlfriend and current estate manager , jade berreau , accuses mcdonald 's of using snow 's sace signature as the major element in that redesign without permission . the lawsuit points out that the sace-ish tag is not only the largest element of the graffiti-themed decor but also the " only element 'created ' by a famous artist . " it says snow " carefully avoided any association with corporate culture and mass-market consumerism , " of which mcdonald 's is the " epitome . " the lawsuit claims berreau originally asked mcdonald 's to remove the offending tag in june , but it " arrogantly refused to comply . " she 's now suing the company for copyright infringement , trademark infringement , unfair competition , and more . in addition to going against what snow stood for , the lawsuit claims mcdonald 's ' use of his art could hurt the value of his actual pieces , which have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars .
