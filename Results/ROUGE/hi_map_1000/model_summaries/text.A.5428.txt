feeling guilty about that huge serving you heaped onto your plate at dinner last night and promptly finished ? you 're not the only one who does it . new research published in the international journal of obesity finds that the average adult eats 92 % of the food on his or her plate . the reasons have yet to be hashed out , but the reality is clear : " if you put it on your plate , it 's going into your stomach , " says brian wansink , director of the cornell food and brand lab , in a eureka alert press release . the findings hold across several developed countries . researchers observed 1,179 diners in the us , canada , france , taiwan , korea , finland , and the netherlands , and regardless of location or gender the results were almost identical . there is , however , one exception : kids . observing 326 participants under 18 , researchers found that the typical child eats 59 % of the food he or she puts on the plate . whatever the reason , we grow up to belong to the clean plate club , as researchers call it , they say this can be a wake-up call to be more mindful of what we serve ourselves in the first place . the la times susses out one piece of good news along those lines : those who pile on fruits , veggies , whole grains , and other healthful stuff tend to clean their plates more thoroughly than those who eat less healthful foods . ( other research suggests it 's all the sitting , not eating , that 's putting on the pounds . )
