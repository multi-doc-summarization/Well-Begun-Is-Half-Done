president obama has been publicly sworn in for his second term—though he actually took the oath yesterday . today the oath , administered by chief justice john roberts , went off a little more smoothly than it did during obama 's first inauguration , though the atlanticwire points out it was n't error-free . and the flub this time was obama 's . while reciting the phrase " the office of the president of the united states , " he effectively choked on the last word , saying just " sta— , " and making a little face after doing so . in other oath-taking tidbits , the president placed his hand on two bibles : one abraham lincoln 's and the other martin luther king 's . ( prof. cornel west was n't thrilled about the latter choice , notes the national review : west slammed the use of king 's " prophetic fire as just a moment in presidential pageantry . " ) joe biden , meanwhile , again took the oath from justice sonia sotomayor , the wall street journal notes . among other highlights of the ceremony thus far : the brooklyn tabernacle choir performed " battle hymn of the republic , " james taylor sang " america the beautiful , " and civil rights leader myrlie evers-williams offered the invocation .
