" according to figures released by the national election council , maduro was elected to a second six-year term after winning around 68 % of the vote , more than 40 points more than his nearest rival , henri falcon , the ap reports . before the result was announced sunday , us deputy secretary of state john sullivan said the us would not recognize the election winner , reports reuters . he said the us is considering oil sanctions on venezuela , though washington wants to target " corrupt regime officials , " not " damage the country in a way that makes it difficult to repair after democracy is restored . " maduro told supporters outside the presidential palace in caracas that his " truly popular victory " had been achieved through an " impeccable electoral process , " but falcon and other critics said irregularities including widespread vote-buying made the results invalid and called for new elections , the guardian reports . reuters notes that after voting , residents of the crisis-stricken country were asked to scan their government-issued " fatherland cards " —which are required to claim benefits—at pro-maduro tents near polling stations to qualify for a " prize " from the socialist leader . officials said turnout out was 46.1 % , down from 80 % in 2013 , though critics said even that number was inflated and the true figure was closer to 30 % .
