so pinocchio was n't that far-fetched after all : the nose may not grow when we lie , but two spanish scientists say it does get noticeably warmer . using thermal imaging cameras on volunteers , emilio gómez milán and elvira salazar lópez found that nose temperature changed depending on their mood , the daily mail reports . the reason : part of the brain called the insular cortex is altered when people lie about their feelings , and the insular cortex detects and regulates body temperature . milán and lópez found other things that heat up , too . their thermal imaging detected male and female sexual arousal in the chest and genital areas , and found that women and men became excited at the same time—even when female volunteers indicated they were not aroused , the daily news reports . the scientists also associated " thermal footprints " with different dances : " when someone dances flamenco , the temperature in their buttocks lowers and it rises in their forearms , " they wrote . " each type of dance has its own . "
