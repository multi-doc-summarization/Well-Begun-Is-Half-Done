what was supposed to be a joyous occasion turned into a bloodbath last night as two armed groups at an afghan wedding got into a gunfight , killing 21 people—including two teen boys—and wounding at least eight others , an afghan official says , per cnn . the shooters , most of whom were guests at the wedding in baghlan province , were believed to be members of illegal local militias , not the taliban or al-qaeda , nbc news reports . although cnn says the cause of the fight was " unclear , " the police chief of the dih salah district of baghlan tells the ap it appears the fight broke out after a relative of a provincial police officer was killed during the celebration for a local mullah 's son , for which 400 or so people had gathered at a private house . meanwhile , the police chief tells the guardian that " a local security official fired in the air after the verbal exchange heated up … and then both sides started trading fire . " the paper notes that " celebratory gunfire " and fatal shootouts are " woefully common " in the region . the paper cites a december wedding in which 17 women and children were killed after afghan army soldiers heard such celebratory gunfire and blasted mortars at the wedding party by mistake . the ap notes that baghlan and other northern afghan provinces have been riddled with insurgent attacks since the 2001 us-led invasion overthrew the taliban , but it adds that local feuds and other criminal activity still proliferate under the cover of war . ( the taliban attacked the afghan parliament just last month . )
