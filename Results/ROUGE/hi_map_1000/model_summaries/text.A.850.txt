a flight from beijing to melbourne , australia , turned terrifying last month when a woman 's headphones exploded midflight , burning her hands , face , and hair , the sydney morning herald reports . the unidentified woman had dozed off a couple of hours into the feb. 19 flight while wearing the headphones , and per an australian transport safety bureau warning issued about the incident , she awoke to a loud bang and a burning sensation on her face . she was able to gather her wits , grab the headphones , and hurl them to the floor , where she says they were " sparking " and " had small amounts of fire . " flight attendants came running with a bucket of water to douse the device , part of which had melted and stuck to the floor of the plane . the atsb release shows images of the woman 's face and neck covered in black soot and with burns and blisters on her hand . " people were coughing and choking the entire way home , " one passenger says about the cabin 's acrid smell . an atsb rep tells abc australia that although this is the first report in the country about a pair of headphones exploding , other devices—including phones and a personal air purifier—have gone up in smoke . an australia civil aviation safety authority rep tells cnn they 'll be looking more into what happened to see if the headphones themselves were damaged , sparking the explosion , or if the blame falls on the batteries . in the meantime , the atsb , which has declined to say what battery brand was involved , reminds travelers that extra device batteries should go in carry-on bags , not checked luggage , and that if a phone or other device falls between the seats , one should dig the device out or call for the crew 's help before moving the seat . ( exploding e-cigs have also been an issue . )
