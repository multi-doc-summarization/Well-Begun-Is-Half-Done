" a cnn spokesman called it " a sad day when the president of the united states encourages violence against reporters . " but on abc news , homeland security adviser tom bossert suggested cnn and other critics were overreacting . " no one would perceive that as a threat , " he said , adding that trump is " beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to .

" those tweets sparked condemnation from all over the political spectrum , with even trump 's fellow republicans calling them unpresidential . on saturday , however , trump took to twitter once again to address the backlash , writing , " my use of social media is not presidential â€“ it 's modern day presidential , " politico reports . at a press conference thursday , deputy white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump " no way , form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence , " the washington post reports .
