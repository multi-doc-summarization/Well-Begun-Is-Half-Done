human blood is rich with genetic material , and scientists have in recent years taken many steps forward in decoding it . the latest announcement—that a blood test can spot cancer at its earliest stages—has the potential to save millions of lives as treatment is administered earlier in the disease 's progression , reports reuters . reporting in the journal science translational medicine , scientists say that by analyzing dna fragments in blood to look for several dozen cancer-driver genes , they spotted 86 out of 138 stage 1 and stage 2 cancers ; they also confirmed no trace of cancer in 44 healthy patients ( in other words , there were zero false positives ) . some call this minimally invasive test a " liquid biopsy . " " this is one of the first studies that has looked directly at early-stage cancers , " says lead author dr. victor velculescu , an oncologist at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center . while the test is proof-of-concept and not yet ready for prime time , detecting 62 % of cancers that were only in stages 1 or 2 is a major milestone , experts say . for instance , less than one in five ovarian cancers are caught that early , when the survival rate is higher than 90 % ; those that are caught after the cancer has spread face a dramatically lower 40 % survival rate five years out , per healthday news . for this study , however , the blood test caught early-stage ovarian cancer 68 % of the time . scientists hope they can get the test much closer to a 100 % detection rate . ( this cancer treatment is being hailed as the most exciting in a lifetime . )
