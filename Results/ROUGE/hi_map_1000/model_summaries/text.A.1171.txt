bob dylan delivered what was described as an " eloquent " lecture this month as part of his nobel prize requirements—but one writer says he may have approached the task like a high school student with an overdue project . dylan discussed three favorite works from childhood and andrea pitzer at slate suspects the nobel prize winner for literature may have cribbed much of the moby dick portion from sparknotes . she says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble sparknotes passages and compares several of them side by side . multiple phrases , including " ahab 's lust for vengeance , " appear both in sparknotes and dylan 's talk , but not in moby dick itself . he had to give the talk to collect $ 922,000 in prize money . " some men who receive injuries are led to god , others are led to bitterness , " a quote that one blogger thought dylan had invented , appears to be based on sparknotes . pitzer suggests that dylan donate some of the prize money to the sparknotes writer , though others are more forgiving . university of minnesota music professor alex lubet tells the star-tribune that dylan 's lecture should n't be treated like a classroom assignment . " his lecture is wild and strange , " lubet says . " it ’ s meant to be a post-modern work of art . any kind of a collage technique is fair game . " in a 2012 rolling stone interview , dylan addressed claims he had lifted lyrics , saying that in songwriting , " you make everything yours . we all do it . "
