as everyone wonders whether conan o ’ brien will stay at nbc or move to fox , the tonight show host offered up a few more novel ideas yesterday : perhaps he ’ ll “ pretend to put my son in a giant foil balloon , then sit back and watch the offers come pouring in ! ” watch him deliver the rest of his options on the video above—then check out jay leno , who also addressed the drama last night on his show . “ nbc says the show performed exactly as they expected it would , and then they canceled it , ” leno said . “ now don ’ t confuse that with when we were on at late night and we performed better than expected and then they canceled us . that was totally different ! ” meanwhile , the los angeles times takes a closer look at fox ’ s early talks with conan—who “ would be a very compatible fit for our brand , ” says the president of fox entertainment .
