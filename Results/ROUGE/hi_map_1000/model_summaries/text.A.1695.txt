australian djs michael christian and mel greig have broken their silence on their royal prank call gone horribly wrong , reports the guardian , tearfully telling an interviewer that they 're " shattered , gutted , heartbroken " over the death of nurse jacintha saldanha . " no one could 've imagined this to happen , " christian said . " naturally , we 're shattered . we 're people , too . " " there 's not a minute that goes by that i do n't think about what ( saldanha 's ) family is going through , and the thought that we may have contributed to it is gut-wrenching , " says greig . the djs meant no harm , adds christian : " at every single point it was innocent on our behalf . " innocent or not , greig and christian " will not return to the airwaves until further notice , " says parent company southern cross austereo , which has also axed their show , halted all prank calls , and nixed ads amid an internal review , cnn reports . but the station is doubling down on its decision to air the prank , saying that it had tried to contact king edward vii 's hospital no fewer than five times to talk about the recording before airing it . " it is absolutely true to say that we actually did attempt to contact those people on multiple occasions , " says southern cross ' ceo . it 's not clear if the hospital responded , notes the afp , but it has mounted a withering assault against the station in the aftermath of saldanha 's death .
