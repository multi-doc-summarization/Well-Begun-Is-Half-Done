jeb bush , having apparently remembered that women make up half the electorate , has walked back comments he made yesterday suggesting that too much money is spent on their health . " i 'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women ’ s health issues , " he told a southern baptist convention yesterday as part of a discussion on defunding planned parenthood and spending the money elsewhere , reports the new york times , which notes that the $ 500 million he was talking about is a small fraction of the roughly $ 1 trillion the federal government spends on health care every year . bush issued a statement last night saying he " misspoke " and " there are countless community health centers , rural clinics , and other women ’ s health organizations that need to be fully funded . " but if bush becomes the republican nominee , video of the remarks " could be used to devastating effect in television ads against him next fall , " notes eli stokols at politico . hillary clinton quickly attacked the remarks , tweeting " you are absolutely , unequivocally wrong , " cnn reports . " he 's got no problem giving billions of dollars away to super wallet and powerful corporations but i guess women ’ s health just isn ’ t a priority for him , " she told an audience last night .
