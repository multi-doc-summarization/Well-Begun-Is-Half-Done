mitt romney 's campaign was scrambling yesterday to reverse any impression that the candidate might be slipping into election oblivion . a gop campaign pollster conceded that , yes , maybe president obama got a bounce out of the democratic national convention , but he warned voters not to get " too worked up about it . " all " signs point to a tight race , " emphasized pollster neil newhouse , reports the huffington post . " while the president has seen a bounce , his approval has already begun to slip , indicating it is likely to recede further . in eight states , pollster.com 's reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points . " an unnamed romney source talking to the national review also slammed reports that romney 's campaign " knows it 's losing , and that ohio is slipping out of reach . " the source said obama 's convention bounce will quickly evaporate . " sometimes i think there â€™ s a conscious effort between the media and chicago to get republicans depressed , " he told richard lowry . " and i hope our friends realize that all these media analysts out there are democrats who want us to lose . "
