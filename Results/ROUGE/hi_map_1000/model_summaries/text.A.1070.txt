there is no shortage of reflections on the life of christopher hitchens today , filled with memories and anecdotes that all seem to include the word " cocktail . " writing for slate , david corn recounts his " hitchens tale , " one that occurred some three decades ago while the two shared a tiny , windowless office at the nation . it seems that corn spent most of his day taking phone messages for hitchens . in the morning , they 'd be along the lines of " 'tell him , that was a wonderful dinner last night . ' or , 'mick was so pleased to meet him . ' " then they 'd shift to invitations for lunch , afternoon drinks , dinner , and an 11pm cocktail date , with hitchens popping in just long enough to get those messages , then depart for said restaurant or watering hole . at some point , an editor would stop by to double-check that hitchens would have , say , the review of a biography ready for her tomorrow . he 'd say yes , then slip an 800-page book that clearly " had yet to be opened ... into his bag and say goodnight . " what he somehow turned in the next day was— " you know the punch line—brilliant . next , it was off to lunch . " corn writes that he learned many lessons from hitchens , but " never how to function in quite this manner . what allowed him to live such a packed life was a trait that any of us would relish : he never forgot what he had ever read or learned . " it 's not a skill that could be taught , but watching hitchens " practice his craft and thrust and parry with intellectuals almost as sharp as him was as valuable an experience as i could have imagined .
