both of tv 's " fat ladies " have sung . clarissa dickson wright , one half of the bbc 's " two fat ladies " cooking duo , died in edinburgh saturday at age 66 , the bbc reports . wright was a former lawyer who filmed four of the " fat ladies " series , going on food-related road trips across the uk in a motorbike and sidecar with jennifer paterson , before paterson died in 1999 from cancer . the new york times describes wright as a " rebel , " both hosts as " irreverent and eccentric , " and the recipes as " sometimes confounding . " wright 's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook , an author , and a cookbook shop manager ; she also ran a catering business , was a guild butcher , and once worked on a yacht in the caribbean . in fact , she recently said , " i 've had a fantastic life and i 've done everything i could have wanted to do and more . " it was n't until her 40s , after she 'd recovered from alcoholism , that she got into cooking seriously . as for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame ? " if you 're fat you 're fat , " she once said . " i hate this modern-day political correctness , that you do n't call things by their proper name . " her agent remembers wright similarly in a statement : " loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world , clarissa was utterly non-pc and fought for what she believed in , always , with no thought to her own personal cost . " there 's no word on wright 's cause of death , but the guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year .
