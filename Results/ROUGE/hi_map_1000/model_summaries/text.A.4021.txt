a scottish brewer has lost its battle to give a bestselling beer the same first name as one of the most popular musicians in history . last week , the uk intellectual property office ruled that brewdog must change the name of its grapefruit-infused elvis juice ipa after attorneys for elvis presley enterprises objected to the brewer applying to register " elvis juice " and " brewdog elvis juice " as trademarks , the daily record reports . the scottish brewers launched the ipa in 2015 and it quickly became a bestseller . not long after , however , attorneys for the presley estate sent them a copyright infringement notice . in response , brewdog co-founders james watt and martin dickie legally changed their first names to " elvis " in october 2016 . " there is n't just one single person in the world called elvis , so we added two more to make a point , " watt told munchies at the time . despite those efforts , hearing officer oliver morris ruled last week against the brewers , saying , " on the basis that elvis is a relatively uncommon name , and given that mr. presley is the most famous of elvises , i consider that most average consumers , on seeing the name elvis alone , are likely to conceptualize that on the basis of elvis presley . " in addition to losing the name of one of its most popular products , brewdog must also pay the presley estate $ 1,934 in court costs . ( read : priscilla presley on why she left elvis . )
