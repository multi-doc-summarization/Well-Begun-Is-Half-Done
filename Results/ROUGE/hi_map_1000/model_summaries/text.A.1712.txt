the us rebuffed iraq 's request for airstrikes as insurgents gained strength , but american drones were already collecting intelligence on the militants . the secret drone program , carried out with the consent of the iraqi government since last year , failed to predict the rapid advance of militants who have now seized several cities , officials tell the wall street journal . " it 's not like it did any good , " one us official says . president obama says " all the options " are being considered to help iraq and while the use of ground troops has been ruled out , officials are considering expanding the drone program . the al-qaeda-linked islamic state of iraq and syria militants have vowed to take the fight to baghdad , and although the capital is not expected to fall , americans in iraq are keeping an eye on the exit . officials say they have stepped up plans for the evacuation of the us embassy in baghdad , and the bbc reports that american defense contractors working with the iraqi military are being shifted to safer areas . hundreds of contractors " are being temporarily relocated by their companies due to security concerns in the area , " according to a state department spokeswoman .
