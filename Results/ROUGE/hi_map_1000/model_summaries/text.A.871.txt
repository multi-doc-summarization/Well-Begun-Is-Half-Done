allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the justice department to raid gibson guitar facilities in tennessee last week . npr aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old lacey act , which prohibits imports of endangered species , including plants , into the us . no formal charges have been pressed , but it appears the issue lies with gibson possibly importing banned madagascar ebony . gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from india . adding some gusto to the story , right-leaning sites assert that gibson rival cf martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars , but the company was never investigated . the landmark report thinks that 's fishy , given that martin 's ceo is a democratic donor and gibson 's ceo is a gop backer . raising the octave even higher , it is possible michelle obama ran afoul of the lacey act when she presented france 's carla bruni with a gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood . however the story plays out , many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law . " it 's a nightmare , " says a dealer . " i ca n't help it if they used brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970 . "
