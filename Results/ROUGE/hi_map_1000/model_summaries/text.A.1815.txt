this might not bode well for president obama 's chances of getting republicans to go along with his jobs plan : the two sides ca n't even agree on when he should unveil it . in response to obama 's request to address a joint session of congress on sept. 7 , john boehner has asked him to postpone the speech one night , reports the hill . boehner noted in his letter that the house is n't scheduled to reconvene until 6:30 on the 7th , which would raise " logistical impediments " in getting the chamber ready for a speech 90 minutes later . he did not mention what everyone else has noted : that obama 's speech would conflict with a gop presidential debate—rick perry 's first one—at the same time . white house spokesman jay carney called the timing a " coincidence , " but that did n't stop critics such as rush limbaugh from piling on , notes mediaite . " this is intended to disrupt the republican debate , " he said on his show today . " it ’ s intended to make obama look bigger than the republicans . " another thing boehner did n't mention : postponing the speech by one night would pit the president against the nfl 's opening night , notes the national journal .
