the latest retelling of snow white ( before june 's snow white and the huntsman ) is a lot like its vain queen : visually stunning , but kind of shallow . critics are n't particularly impressed with mirror mirror : though director tarsem singh " knows how to make performers and sets look good , he has trouble putting them into vibrant , kinetic , meaningful play , " notes manohla dargis in the new york times . that " effectively means that he â€™ s a better window dresser than a movie director . " in the toronto star , linda barnard agrees . " everything about mirror mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous , " she notes . it 's " a pretty , spun-sugar confection , airy as a plate of easter egg-colored macarons and similarly devoid of substance . " the script does n't hold up to the visuals , writes roger ebert in the chicago sun-times . " the dialogue is rather flat , the movie sort of boring , " he notes . it 's " a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks . " in the los angeles times , however , sheri linden sees a lot to like . " the fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast , led by a royally wicked julia roberts " as the queen . it 's " a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between disney and grimm . "
