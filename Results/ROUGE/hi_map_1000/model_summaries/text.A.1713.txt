a new timepiece the size of a dining-room table is being hailed as perhaps the world 's most precise : it 's " like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds , " says andrew ludlow , co-author of a study behind what 's being called the ytterbium optical lattice clock . until now , the standard for time precision in the us has been a cesium-based clock . some 9.19 billion oscillations of its electromagnetic signal defines a second . but the ytterbium clock oscillates about a quadrillion times per second , allowing observers to " divide time into finer and finer intervals , " ludlow notes . those intervals are extremely regular ; indeed , two of the clocks have set a record for stability , science daily reports . their timing would be perfect for about as long as the universe has existed . experts must measure the cesium clock across five days for the most precise readings , whereas the ytterbium clock requires just a second to offer the same level of precision . why would we ever need such a thing ? it could mean better gps , for example : because the navigation systems are in space , their time perception is n't quite the same as ours on earth . scientists could better correct for that using a more precise clock , cnn notes .
