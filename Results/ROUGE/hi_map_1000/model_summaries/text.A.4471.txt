almost a million jars of peanut butter are being trucked to a new mexico landfill after costco refused to either accept them or allow them to be donated to food banks . the peanut butter—made from $ 2.8 million worth of valencia peanuts owned by costco—is being dumped as part of the sale of a bankrupt plant linked to a huge peanut butter recall in 2012 , reports the ap . sunland , once the nation 's largest producer of organic peanut butter , went bankrupt last year following the much publicized salmonella outbreak , and a canadian company has snapped up the plant for $ 25 million , the albuquerque journal reports . the jars had been sitting in a warehouse since last fall , and while court filings say " all parties agreed there 's nothing wrong with the peanut butter from a health and safety issue , " costco on march 19 said it had to be destroyed ; the company previously determined the jars were " not merchantable " because of leaky peanut oil . the last of 58 truckloads of peanut butter is due to arrive at a landfill in clovis today , where it will be covered in dirt . a spokeswoman for new mexico 's largest food bank declined to comment on the peanut butter dump , but noted that " rescued food " accounts for 74 % of what it distributes . and the drama does n't end there : the ap notes that a north carolina company had won the first round of bidding for sunland with a $ 20 million offer , only to be outbid by golden boy foods just minutes before the court hearing that would have approved hampton farms ' purchase ; hampton farms is prepping for an appeal .
