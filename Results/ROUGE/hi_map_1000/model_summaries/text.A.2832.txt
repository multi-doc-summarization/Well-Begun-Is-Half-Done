george zimmerman is constantly on the move and in the news . it 's been nearly three years since he shot unarmed black teen trayvon martin to death in sanford , fla. , and his speaking engagements and meetings with attorneys afford him no more than a month in any given state . the orlando sentinel recently caught up with him at a gun show and reports that the 30-year-old is in debt , constantly under attack on twitter , and carries a semi-automatic handgun for extra protection but that he refuses to use an alias because , he says , " i 'm not able to lie . " zimmerman continues to pop in and out of the news . late last year he made headlines when bids on ebay for his " first hand painted artwork " hit nearly $ 100,000 , reports the miami herald . a few months prior , his estranged wife—who 'd just filed for divorce—called 911 saying he 'd threatened her with a gun , but she never followed up with charges . not long after that , he was arrested on domestic violence charges , which his girlfriend ultimately dropped . ( earlier this month , a driver in florida called police saying zimmerman had threatened to shoot him dead when overcome by road rage . )
