chris christie has just about had it with that pesky oracle of omaha and all his talk about millionaires paying more taxes . the new jersey governor cut off piers morgan 's warren buffett question at the pass in an interview last night on cnn , telling him , " he should just write a check and shut up . really , and just contribute . the fact of the matter is that i 'm tired of hearing about it . if he wants to give the government more money , he 's got the ability to write a checkâ€”go ahead and write it . " as morgan protested that he had n't heard the question , christie said , " i know the question . do you really think warren buffett needs as much attention from the government as the most vulnerable ? " christie relented a bit , notes politico , saying that " during difficult economic times you 're most concerned about the people who have the potential to suffer the most , " but that " i 'm not going to get into this class warfare business where certain people are more important than others . "
