mexican president pena nieto has promised sweeping reforms to the country 's police amid nationwide outrage over the massacre of 43 students abducted by a local police force working with gang members . " mexico must change , " he said yesterday , unveiling plans to dissolve all 1,800 of the country 's local police forces—many of which are notoriously corrupt and infiltrated by gang members—and replace them with state-wide forces , the bbc reports . the president 's proposal would also allow the federal government to take over town governments corrupted by cartels . most of mexico 's police officers belong to local forces and most of them make less than $ 500 a month , encouraging the corruption pena nieto aims to stamp out . but critics say the president is merely repacking initiatives already in progress and trying to repeat a few failed ones , and question is whether things will be any better if the police are put under unified control . " the root problem is the quality of the police , not who commands them , " a public security expert tells the wall street journal . " many state forces are also a disaster . " the president 's plan will focus on four of the most violent states at first , including guerrero , where the students were kidnapped and where 11 decapitated bodies were found dumped by a road yesterday , the ap reports .
