a minivan driving around san francisco has fueled speculation that apple may be creating its own " street view " for apple maps , the guardian reports . spotted by the claycord news & talk blog , the van had 12 cameras mounted along with a lidar sensor , which uses a spinning laser to survey the environment . " when asked about what they are doing , the person sitting in the vehicle would never give an answer , " says the blog . what 's more , cbs san francisco reports that the vehicle is leased to apple . could they be mounting a rival to google maps ' popular street view ? after all , apple is planning to release ios 9 for iphones and ipads in the summer , and was rather embarrassed by apple maps ' poor directions and subpar 3d imagery when it first came out . yet apple would need a fleet of vehicles to challenge google 's street view , the verge notes . also , technology analyst rob enderle says the van has " too many cameras " for street-viewing and may in fact be a self-driving vehicle . the van also resembles one seen in a brooklyn youtube video that describes it as a " self-driving car . " apple is n't among companies with a permit to test self-driving cars , but the van may be used by an apple partner who does : " you know , they have partnerships with a variety of the carmakers , " says enderle . " just because they ’ re leasing the car doesn ’ t necessarily mean it ’ s their project . " apple has no comment on the high-tech van or vans—so " it looks like these curious vehicles will remain a mystery for now , " says the verge . ( see why uber may use " robo-cabs . " )
