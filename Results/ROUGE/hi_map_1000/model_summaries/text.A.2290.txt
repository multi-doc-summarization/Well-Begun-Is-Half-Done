some 30 large whales have been found dead in the western gulf of alaska since may and the noaa wants to know why . the agency says it is opening a scientific investigation into what is calls an " unusual mortality event , " with the number of whale deaths at three times the historical average for the area , reports the ap . the noaa describes the event in a release as " a significant die-off " involving 11 fin whales , 14 humpback whales , one gray whale , and four unidentified whales . a rep suggests the deaths could be tied to algae bloom toxins , but there 's no evidence for that yet . the noaa notes the investigation could take months or even years . officials have only been about to nab a sample from one of the 30 whales and it was labeled " less than ideal , " reports the cbc , which notes the sample contained no presence of one strain of algae toxins . getting to more whales is difficult : parts of the coastline can be tough to get to , floating carcasses are hard to access as well , and beached whales can be magnets for bears , a coordinator says . scientists will thus study environmental factors , historical data , and deaths among seabirds and other creatures to help shed light on the issue . " our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live , " the coordinator says . researchers will also work with colleagues in british columbia , where five large whales have been found dead this month ; necropsy results on two are pending .
