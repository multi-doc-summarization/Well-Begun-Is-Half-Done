three years after the gulf of mexico oil spill , bp has launched a suit of its own—against a plaintiffs ' lawyer who , the company says , has represented tens of thousands of " phantom " clients in the case . bp says part of its settlement over the spill , worth $ 2.3 billion , was calculated using figures from lawyer mikal watts . " the facts of this case shout fraud , " says a bp rep. " tens of thousands of mikal watts ’ clients have proved to be phantoms , " and the " false representations improperly inflated the value of potential claims " in the seafood industry , businessweek reports . watts has said he was fighting for some 40,000 deckhands affected by the disaster , but half of them are n't real , according to bp , which found that 45 % of their supposed social security numbers actually belonged to others , living or dead ; others had made-up numbers . a lawyer for watts says he " never committed identity theft and did not defraud bp or anyone else , " and claims were reviewed by an independent body . he calls bp 's move " another of a series of efforts to walk away from the settlement to which it agreed , " the new york times reports . in other bp news : an exploration well off brazil turns out not to have commercially-viable amounts of fuel ; the company will write off more than $ 1 billion in related costs , the wall street journal reports . but bp says it has made a major oil discovery in the gulf of mexico , adding to a big year for the company 's exploration efforts .
