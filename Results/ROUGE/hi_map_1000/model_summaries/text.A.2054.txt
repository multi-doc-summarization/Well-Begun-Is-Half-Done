if misery and politics make strange bedfellows , their election 2016 love child in the fourth estate is a nascent project called electionland . as politico reports , major media outlets are abandoning the time-honored practice of scooping each other in order to combine reporting forces in the name of making sure election day is as clean as possible . " it ’ s an entire national newsroom , essentially only looking at problems facing people who vote , " says a senior reporting fellow at propublica , the nonprofit which gave birth to electionland earlier this year and was quickly joined by the likes of the new york times , usa today , and google news lab , as well as scores of more regional media outlets like the arizona republic , miami herald , and the virginian-pilot . notable among those who declined to partner up : cnn and the associated press . yet it 's what quartz calls " an unprecedented gathering of journalists , " and includes newsrooms set up at city university of new york and at 13 journalism schools . on tuesday , electionland will watch social media , google search trends , and data from the election protection project , as well as receive reports from reporters on the ground . " this is a really interesting experiment , " says a politics editor at usa today . " i don ’ t know exactly how it ’ s going to work . i don ’ t think any of us do . it seems like the right thing to do . " adds snopes ' managing editor : " it 's going to be a sh -- show . "
