it probably did n't bode well when ryan adams hung up on an australian interviewer in september who would n't stop asking about his marriage to mandy moore . or when adams ' self-titled album from last year turned out to be " one of the more downcast , melancholic lps in the singer-songwriter 's vast catalog , " in the words of rolling stone . this might be why : radar reports that adams , 40 , and moore , 30 , are divorcing after six years . moore cited irreconcilable differences when filing the papers . they have no kids . in other celeb divorce news , patrick dempsey—aka " dr. mcdreamy " —is splitting with his wife of 15 years , jillian fink , reports page six . they have a 12-year-old daughter and 7-year-old twins .
