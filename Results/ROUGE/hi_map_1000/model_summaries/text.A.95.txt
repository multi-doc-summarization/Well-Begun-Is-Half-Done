innocent flub ? public diss ? either way , president trump and wife melania provided an unintentionally buzzy moment upon their arrival in tel aviv . watch it via this video clip from the newspaper haaretz . it shows the president reaching back to take wife melania 's hand on the airport tarmac and then her , well , not taking him up on it . that has triggered lots of coverage along these lines in the daily news : she " refused to hold her husband 's hand and then slapped it away . " a post at the daily beast raises the ante on that sentiment . but many also were taking a more middle-ground approach , hedging descriptions of melania 's action with phrases like " appeared to be swatting " ( people ) or " seems to swat away " ( los angeles times ) . the washington post , meanwhile , offered one of the most charitable explanations : " or maybe , upon close inspection of the footage , perhaps she just missed grabbing his outstretched hand , like a trapeze artist flubbing the catch , " writes emily heil . she notes that trumpian hand-holding is a favorite topic of white house watchers , meaning the two ought to at least " work on their choreography " if they want to avoid feeding the memes . ( this is n't the first time melania has seemed to flinch at her husband 's touch . )
