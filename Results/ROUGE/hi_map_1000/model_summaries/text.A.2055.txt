this has to rank among the best opening statements ever in a study abstract : " although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention from philosophers , its reception ( critical or ingenuous ) has not , to our knowledge , been subject to empirical investigation . " and so researchers at the university of waterloo in ontario set out to study " pseudo-profound bullshit , " and who believes it . reporting in the journal judgment and decision making , the researchers asked subjects to rate quotes that are philosophical , mundane , or simply bs—the latter consisting , in their words , of " seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous " —on a profundity scale . the team also tested participants ' cognitive and reasoning ability . the researchers found that those who are " more receptive " to bs have lower " verbal and fluid intelligence " and are more likely to believe in the paranormal , conspiracy theories , and alternative medicine . for actual examples of readily propagated bs , forbes reports phd candidate gordon pennycook and his team turned to the twitter feed of deepak chopra , highlighting tweets such as " attention and intention are the mechanics of manifestation . " the telegraph reports the researchers also used this website , which composes made-up pseudo-profound statements like this one : " growth is the richness of life , and of us . " the researchers found that participants assigned the website-generated bs and chopra 's tweets similar profoundness ratings . as for who was good at sniffing out bs , forbes reports it was those who tend to " have an analytic cognitive style and be skeptical about paranormal phenomena . " chopra 's response to it all ? he tweeted , " i thank the authors for the study . their # bullshit is getting me more speaking engagements & new book offers .
