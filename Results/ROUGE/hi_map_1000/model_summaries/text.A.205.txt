guess google execs are serious about that whole reorg under the alphabet parent-company thing . just days after alphabet officially became google 's holding company , it scooped up a brand-new domain name : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com , which has been around since 1999 and was purchased for an unspecified amount , nbc news reports . the page is n't functional as of this post , and a company rep says , " we realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz , so we 're just being thorough . " ( google set up that website in august . ) it 's hard to imagine google directing the general public to use the site—would you want to type in all those letters every time ? —and nbc notes the domain purchase may simply be a preemptive strike to keep others from usurping it for their own use . two domains the company probably wo n't be able to get its hands on : abc.com ( for the american broadcasting company , owned by disney ) and alphabet.com , which bmw is unlikely to give up , notes consumerist . if you 'd been hoping to nab the domain for yourself , you can always try to cybersquat the site away when google 's hold on it expires in august 2018 . ( alphabet has ditched its " do n't be evil " motto for one that 's not as quirky . )
