the term " sex addiction " might get tossed around a lot these days as a way to explain some not-so-classy behavior of the anthony weiner-tiger woods variety , but is it really an addiction on par with drugs or alcohol ? the first study to explore brain responses in people who describe themselves as hypersexual suggests otherwise , reports ucla . researchers there showed the subjects—39 men and 13 women—sexual images , and discovered that their brains did n't respond in the same way that , say , a cocaine addict would respond to images of cocaine . “ most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘ addiction ’ —that ’ s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it , " one of the researchers tells slate . " but this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems. ” the subjects have higher libidos , or sexual desire , but not necessarily a clinical medical problem . they still need help , but if further studies verify this first one , then the type of help they 'll get will be affected . all of which might be ok , writes jillian keenan at slate . " if we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a 'disease , ' after all , then we ’ re all screwed . " the study is in the journal socioaffective neuroscience & psychology .
