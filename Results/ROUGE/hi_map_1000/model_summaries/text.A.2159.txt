if his house censure is still stinging , charlie rangel would do well to pick up today 's washington post . columnists dana milbank and david broder do n't exactly make the case he 's innocent ( not even rangel does that ) , but they lend sympathetic voices : milbank : he belittles the house ethics panel , calling it rank hypocrisy that rangel got singled out for common behavior . " if it 's any consolation , rangel should know that however harmed he was by the censure , the entity that was really disgraced was congress itself . this is because rangel 's two-year battle with the house ethics committee exposed the woeful state of lawmakers ' abilities to police their own . " broder : he likens rangel 's case to that of dan rostenkowski 's in the late '80s . " he and rosty had the same view of the hometown patronage games that brought them down . they wanted the perks that went with their positions of power . but they used them more often to help others along than for themselves , and they were n't greedy . often , they were just sloppy about the demands of the new era of politics .
