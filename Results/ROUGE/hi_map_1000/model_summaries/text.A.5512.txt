" we 're using our groundwater resources too fast—faster than they 're being renewed , " dr. tom gleeson says in a university of victoria press release . gleeson , along with fellow researchers , published the most accurate map of earth 's groundwater supply to date on monday in nature geoscience . the study found there is about 14.3 million cubic miles of groundwater left on earth . but that 's not as encouraging as it sounds , according to reuters , because no more than 6 % of it is renewable within a human lifetime . " that 's never been known before , " says gleeson , who adds that people are going to need to manage that resource better as water demands grow amid ongoing drought . " groundwater can and should be thought of as a very useful buffer to climate extremes , " he says . " it 's a valuable and strategic resource for mitigating the extreme impacts of climate . " the amount of groundwater less than 50 years old is enough to cover every continent with approximately 10 feet of water , according to the study . but while that young groundwater is more quickly replenished , it 's also more easily polluted by people and impacted by climate change , reuters reports . the rest of earth 's groundwater—which can be millions of years old—is much deeper underground and can be extremely salty and contain harmful elements , according to the press release . the next step is to figure out how dire the situation is . " since we now know how much groundwater is being depleted and how much there is , we will be able to estimate how long until we run out , " gleeson says . ( but at least we might have more helium left that we thought . )
