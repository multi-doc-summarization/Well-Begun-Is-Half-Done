framing the state of the economy in personal terms , referring to " my numbers , " president trump blasted fed chief jerome powell and the central bank itself in an interview with the wall street journal . trump called the fed the " biggest risk " to the economy , due to the three times it 's raised interest rates this year ; it will likely do so a fourth time in december . trump lamented powell " was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy . it 's turned out that he 's not , " adding that powell " almost looks like he 's happy " when he raises the rates . trump also seemed irritated that during former president obama 's tenure in the white house , interest rates hovered near zero . the journal explains the fed has been increasing the benchmark rate as a move to control inflation and keep financial bubbles at bay . cnn , meanwhile , notes the " historically low " interest rates under obama were needed to jump-start a post-recession economy . still , trump told the journal that while it 's " too early to say , " he " maybe " is n't so sure he should have nominated powell . " i do n't know , " he said when asked in what scenario he 'd remove his fed head , a move for which nbc news notes there 's no precedent . " i 'm just saying this : i 'm very unhappy with the fed . " both former fed chief janet yellen and ex-trump economic adviser gary cohn say the president should ease up on the central bank , traditionally an independent entity , per cnn . more from trump 's journal interview here , including his take on his former attorney , michael cohen .
