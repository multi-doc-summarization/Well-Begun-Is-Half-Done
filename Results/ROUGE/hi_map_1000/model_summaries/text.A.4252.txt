john mccain 's opposition to the latest gop effort to repeal obamacare did n't quite kill the legislation 's chances , though it came pretty close . still , democrats are taking pains not to declare victory in public or do anything that smacks of gloating , reports politico . as democratic hawaii sen. brian schatz tweeted , " this bill is not dead yet . you can relax on october 1 . they never let up , and neither can we . " ( after that date , democrats will be able to easily kill any repeal effort with a filibuster . ) mccain joins rand paul as a definite no , meaning mitch mcconnell ca n't afford one more defection even as susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska both were leaning in that direction . so what next ? mcconnell is n't saying yet whether he will proceed with a vote on the bill from bill cassidy and lindsey graham regardless , reports the washington post . if the repeal effort does indeed fail this month , democrats want to resurrect bipartisan talks aimed at improving obamacare , rather than dismantling it . but given the vast differences in ideas on the left and right about what is necessary , the hill does n't see much hope for an " era of bipartisanship " on health care . on friday night , president trump called mccain 's decision " horrible " but suggested that republicans continue with the vote . “ the most we ’ ll be is one or two votes short , ” he said , per the new york times . " you can ’ t quit when you have one or two votes short . you can ’ t do it . " meanwhile , co-author graham did n't sound too peeved at mccain . " my friendship with @ senjohnmccain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he ’ s lived his life and the person he is , " he tweeted .
