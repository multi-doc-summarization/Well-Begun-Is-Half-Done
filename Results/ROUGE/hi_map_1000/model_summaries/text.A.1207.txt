sarah palin has already offered an explanation for the reportedly booze-fueled brouhaha in anchorage her family was involved in last month , but now there 's apparently audiotape to supplement that account . tmz has released what it says is a copy of bristol , willow , and sarah palin 's complaints to police outside a sept. 6 party that got out of control ( radar and extra also posted portions of the audio ) . the woman on the tape alleged to be bristol " hysterically " tells cops that sister willow had come up to her at the bash and said , " ‘ some old lady just [ expletive ] pushed me . she just hit me . " bristol then adds that when she went to confront the alleged pusher , " some guy gets in my face , pushes me down on the grass , drags me across the grass ! [ says to me ] , 'you sl-t , you f -- -ing c-nt . " ( willow says on the tape that that guy was korey klingenmeyer , the host of the party . ) bristol then expands her litany of injustices : " they took my $ 300 sunglasses . they took my f -- -ing shoes and i ’ m f -- -ing left here ? … where is my s -- t ? i have a 5-year-old in the car ! " the police report indicates klingenmeyer asked bristol to leave because he did n't want her to pick fights with anyone . sarah palin—who can allegedly be heard on the tape advising her progeny not to use obscenities and saying , " but they let the bad guys go ! " —posted support for bristol on facebook on sept. 19 , raving , " i love my bristol ! my straight-shooter is one of the strongest young women you 'll ever meet . i have to say this as a proud mama : … my kids ' defense of family makes my heart soar ! "
