think wendy davis ' 10-hour filibuster was impressive ? that was nothing compared to what dozens of lawmakers in south korea just accomplished in the country 's first filibuster in 47 years . for 192 hours and 25 minutes—or almost nine days—beginning feb. 23 , opposition members of parliament rambled on in an attempt to block an anti-terror bill proposed by a member of the governing party , report the bbc and korea times . the goal was to get to the end of the parliamentary session on march 10 , but the filibuster came to a close wednesday after attacks by the country 's leaders . the bill passed hours later . at least the lawmakers still have something to show for their efforts : they smashed the world record for filibustering set in 2011 when canadian lawmakers delayed proceedings for 57 hours . the last speaker alone spoke for 12 hours and 31 minutes to claim the record for longest individual filibuster in south korea . speakers wore running shoes , thumbed through huge stacks of documents , read academic articles and online comments on privacy infringement in their entirety , and recited sections of george orwell 's 1984 , per yonhap news . it was unsurprising , then , that the parliament chair was caught sleeping . the lawmakers argued the anti-terror bill—allowing for the collection of data , including phone records , on people considered security risks—would violate privacy rights , but president park geun-hye said the filibuster was " nothing more than a dereliction of duty . " the public was also peeved that the stunt held up bills regarding north korean human rights and an upcoming election .
