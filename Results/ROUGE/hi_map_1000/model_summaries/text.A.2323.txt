appropriate parenting or criminal behavior ? that 's the question being asked across the us in regards to the case of a louisiana woman arrested monday for whipping her young sons after they burglarized a neighbor 's house . among the people speaking up for schaquana evita spears , a 30-year-old single mom of six , is lisa nicholson—the woman whose baton rouge home spears 's sons , ages 13 , 12 , and 10 , broke into . " i would prefer for her to spank her own kids than for them to come into someone 's house and for [ the homeowner ] to kill them , " nicholson tells the advocate . the fate they faced instead after allegedly stealing what the advocate reports was $ 1,700 in goods , including a computer and hoverboard : per the east baton rouge sheriff ’ s office report , the oldest boy 's wounds were bleeding , and the 12-year-old 's skin was broken by the lashes . wbrz reports the 13-year-old 's injuries were on his arms , with marks on his body , and he told police an rca cable was used ; the youngest boy had a small scratch on the hand . in a statement , the district attorney hillar moore said the case is under review and noted " the law does not allow excessive pain or cruelty but does allow physical parental discipline . " but some experts , referencing a 2016 study , tell the advocate that corporal punishment is not effective and can actually lead to worse behavior . " it 's been hell , " spears—whose kids were , as of wednesday , in the care of a grandmother—tells wbrz . " i never could imagine trying to be a good mother would end me up in jail . " a gofundme page set up for spears says she lost her job over the incident . " jus [ sic ] want my life back , " she wrote on facebook on friday . ( these bank workers were publicly spanked for " not exceeding themselves . " )
