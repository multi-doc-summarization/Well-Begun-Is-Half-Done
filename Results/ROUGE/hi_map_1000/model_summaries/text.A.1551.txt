no sadder news emerged in the aftermath of the townville school shooting last month than the death of 6-year-old jacob hall . but though his family and friends lost the south carolina first-grader much sooner than they should have , they did n't lose his spirit—which is why a variety of superheroes flooded oakdale baptist church tuesday to mourn jacob and celebrate his life , cnn reports . the tuesday visitation was the prelude to jacob 's wednesday funeral , where his mother , renae hall , said she wanted everyone to pay tribute to her son in the way he would 've wanted it . " i do n't want suits and ties and all that , " she told reporters saturday , per fox carolina . " there will be a lot of children there and i do n't want it to be scary for them . " the ap notes jacob was dressed as batman in his tiny blue casket during wednesday 's service . the superhero theme was also dominant at tuesday 's visitation , which cnn notes more resembled a child 's birthday party than a memorial service : there were balloons , flowers filled with stuffed teenage mutant ninja turtles , and family members in their own superhero attire greeting visitors in front of jacob 's coffin , which the ap notes was adorned with ninja turtle stickers . one man even drove his batmobile from west virginia to pay his respects at the funeral . " jacob lee hall , townville 's very own superhero , was … given to us as a gift , and through those six years up until the very last moment of his life with us , god was and still is today accomplishing his purpose with jacob , " said the reverend who spoke to the gathered well-wishers wednesday .
