" in a 2015 youtube video , schooley explains , " it 's never mattered to me . i have my family and i would n't trade them for anything . " meanwhile in 1998 , a woman named pattie whitaker posted on a genealogy forum that she " will not give up " searching for her niece , bonnie lee webster , who disappeared in 1977 . the 18-month-old was apparently abandoned by whitaker 's late sister , who never explained what happened to the child . genealogy sleuth rona randall saw the post and found an old newspaper photo of jane doe 927â€”a " perfect match " to baby bonnie . last month , randall found schooley and put her in touch with whitaker . schooley tells the globe-news she ca n't justify the expense of the dna test with two sons to raise . but , she adds , she may do it if the truth provides " closure " for whitaker , her probable aunt . " that would be the only thing i feel i have to offer , " she says . ( parents held out hope their missing daughter was still alive . she was n't . )
