the macabre story of the pregnant woman who was stoned to death by her own family on tuesday in pakistan just got far more twisted : mohammad iqbal has revealed to cnn that he murdered his first wife so he could wed farzana parveen . officials confirm that his first wife was indeed killed , some six years ago ; the guardian reports she was strangled . iqbal 's 20-something son reportedly went to police after the killing , and iqbal spent a number of weeks on the run before being arrested . the son says his father served a year in jail ; police say he was freed after reaching a " compromise " with his family as allowed by pakistani law . iqbal says , " i wanted to send a proposal to farzana so i killed my wife . " the timeline of the events remains a bit murky in terms of when iqbal met parveen , with the guardian previously reporting the two were engaged for nearly two years before marrying this january . cnn does clarify some details about iqbal and parveen 's involvement , per iqbal : he says that the woman 's mother died in december , and her father and brothers then changed their mind about the agreed-upon marriage , preferring she wed a cousin instead . the two opted to elope on jan. 7 , and her furious family demanded more money on top of what iqbal had initially paid in exchange for their lives . iqbal says his refusal to pay led to an abduction charge against him , and parveen was planning to testify when she was attacked outside the court . according to a preliminary police report , her own brothers bashed her head with bricks .
