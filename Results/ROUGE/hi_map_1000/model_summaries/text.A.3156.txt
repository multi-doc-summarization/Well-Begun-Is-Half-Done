while she may not have been hopping mad , a wisconsin woman certainly was n't happy about being told to leave a mcdonald 's in beaver dam with the animal she says is her support kangaroo . according to tmj4 , police told diane moyer to leave the restaurant after a customer complained about jimmy , the 8-month-old kangaroo she had sitting in an infant car seat . she explained that the kangaroo is considered a therapy animal and that she has a doctor 's note of approval , but she was still asked to leave by a police officer who told her a customer had said it was n't appropriate or safe to have the kangaroo in the restaurant . moyer , who lives on a 70-acre farm with jimmy , four other kangaroos , and assorted other animals , tells the daily citizen that the marsupials are among the " most loving , trustworthy animals that i have ever had " and that authorities have fully inspected her farm to make sure it 's suitable for kangaroos . she says she has taken jimmy to that mcdonald 's many times before , as well as to the movies and her church , and nobody else has complained . " i wish the person in mcdonald 's would have just come and talked to me instead , " she says . ( last year , an iraq vet in ohio was ordered to get rid of his 14 " therapy ducks . " )
