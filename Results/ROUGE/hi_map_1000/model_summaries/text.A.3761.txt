what with facebook , flickr , and other fine venues for stalking " exes , " breakups are n't nearly as final as they once were . but for your own good , please stop following them around cyberspace . " conventional wisdom , and even science , has it that cutting off contact with an ex makes for a smoother recovery , " writes tracy clark-flory at salon . and she knows the struggle all too well , having tracked an ex from flickr to twitter until she realized that the ring on his finger was n't " merely an engagement ring . " not only was he already married , but clark-flory had to see a live-tweeted photo of him standing in the aisle . " it ’ s one thing to realize that the man you once wanted to marry " has moved on , she writes , " and another to be a virtual witness to it . " clark-flory digs up studies to make her case , like one that finds " facebook stalking ... may obstruct the process of healing " and another in which 30 % of college students admit to posting status updates " to taunt or hurt " an ex . the only problem : " it ’ s never been easier to secretly keep tabs on exes , " writes clark-flory , " and it ’ s never been harder not to .
