" cbs baltimore reports the " congealed lump of fat " was found between baltimore penn station and the 1700 block of charles street . the fatberg is comprised of fats , oils , and grease that hardened and collected other things that do n't break down in the sewer , such as wet wipes , according to the baltimore sun . authorities say it was blocking up to 85 % of a 2-foot-wide , 100-year-old pipe . london recently made international news when a fatberg weighing more than 140 tons was discovered lurking in its sewer . authorities found the fatberg while looking for the source of two sewer overflows in recent weeks , including one on sept. 21 that sent 1.2 million gallons of sewage into the jones falls . while the main fatberg has already been largely broken apart and shipped to a landfill , authorities found a number of smaller fatbergs throughout baltimore 's sewer system . restaurants and residents alike are advised to avoid putting fats , oils , grease , and wet wipes ( even if they 're technically " flushable " ) into the sewer system . " the only items that should be considered flushable are poo , pee , and toilet paper , " wbff states . ( part of london 's fatberg may find an unusual home . )
