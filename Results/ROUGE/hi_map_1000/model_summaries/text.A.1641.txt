right-leaning websites such as conservatives4palin are jumping on a 2008 video they say shows katie couric " mocking " sarah palin . in the footage , taken the day palin was picked to be the vp candidate , couric struggles off air with the names of the candidate 's kids . " where the hell do they get these names , " she asks after reading off " trig " and " track . " the site also accuses couric of being generally dismissive of palin throughout her initial coverage , with a focus on " moose burgers and beauty pageants . " some other reactions : " the comments themselves aren ’ t an indictment , " but the video does allow us to watch the seeds of bias get planted in couric ’ s mind , " to such an extent that she felt it necessary to share them with her co-workers , " writes ed morrissey for hot air . " the mccain campaign bet badly on having palin give her first major interview to cbs news . " the criticism is off base , writes colby hall at mediaite . keep in mind that palin was virtually unknown at the time , " and regardless of where one finds his or herself on the political spectrum , palin ’ s kids do have unique names . " and any other " bullet points " about palin 's life highlighted by cbs undoubtedly came from the mccain campaign . " to call this proof of her mocking palin just falls way short of its mark . " still , it will be interesting to see if palin seizes on the tape , notes ben smith at politico . given her " fixation " on the media in general and couric in particular , " it would seem quite tempting .
