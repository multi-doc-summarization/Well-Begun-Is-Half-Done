so did mitt romney help his cause with the right with his health care speech today ? the early reaction is n't pretty for him on that front : avik roy , national review : " his effort to make a distinction between romneycare and obamacare was not persuasive : if anything , he convincingly made the opposite case , that romneycare and obamacare are based on the same fundamental concept . " jennifer rubin , washington post : " the consensus : if possible , romney made things worse . if anything , romney proved to be a far more articulate spokesman for the individual mandate than obama . and if conservative pundits hated it this much , can you imagine what tea partyers will think ? " ezra klein , washington post : the speech was " as thoroughgoing a defense of the individual mandate as i ’ ve heard in months . the white house would ’ ve been wise to take notes . " potential rival rick santorum , at time : " both romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government 's healthcare cost burden . romneycare has , in fact , not made healthcare better or saved costs in massachusetts . it 's done just the opposite .
