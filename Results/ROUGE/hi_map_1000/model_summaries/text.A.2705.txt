feeling upbeat ? enough of that : planet earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend , scientists say . according to a new paper , the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew , nbc news reports . the analysis " employed better knowledge " of earth 's natural extinction rate , the guardian reports , upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions . it then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative . presto , they got a rate since 1900 that 's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one . " we were very surprised to see how bad it is , " says study leader gerardo ceballos . " this is very depressing . " " if it is allowed to continue , life would take millions of years to recover , and our species itself would disappear early on , " says ceballos . but nations can reverse the crisis—which has been linked to deforestation , industrialization , and other human factors—by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations , the paper says . so far critics seem to buy the paper 's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries . " it is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world , " writes one environmentalist . earth has seen five other mass extinctions , including one 443 million years ago that killed off 83 % of sea life , and the most recent , which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago , the telegraph notes .
