less than a month after its big launch , google+ has hit its first minus : usage declined 3 % to 1.79 million visits last week , reports bloomberg . what 's more , time spent on the new social media site dropped 10 % , falling to 5 minutes to 15 seconds . it 's important to note experian hitwise 's numbers include neither international nor mobile web traffic , and google+ is technically still in " limited beta , " writes mg siegler of techcrunch . but when your prime competition has 750 million users , any setback can be daunting . since making its debut june 28 , google+ quickly rose to 20 million users in just three weeks . " there was a sense of excitement : could this really be the next big social network ? " writes siegler . but " after initially checking it several times a day , i now load google+ about twice a day , mainly to see if i ’ m missing anything . i rarely find that i am . i +1 a few things here and there , maybe leave a comment . but overall , the content feels fairly stale . the new car smell is wearing off . and it ’ s time for reality . " and that reality ? " user retention is a bitch , " says siegler .
