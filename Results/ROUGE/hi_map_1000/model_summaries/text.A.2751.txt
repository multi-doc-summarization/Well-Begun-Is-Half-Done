it was inevitable : a purported photo of anthony weiner 's naughty bits ( this time sans underwear ) is now on the internet , courtesy of radio hosts opie and anthony of sirius , reports mediaite . how it came to be : they had andrew breitbart on this morning , and he showed them the photo ( yep , the one he said he would n't release ) on his phone . as it made the rounds , a video camera captured an image , according to these tweets . if you must see , you can get an uncensored look here . " it will be interesting to see how much this picture affects the story , " writes mediaite 's jon bershad . " the photo doesn ’ t add any new indiscretions . however , it ’ s quite possible that seeing an actual pornographic , fully nude image will be enough to put the final nail in the coffin . "
