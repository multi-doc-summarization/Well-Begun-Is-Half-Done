originally facing 10 years in prison for giving water to pigs on their way to a slaughterhouse , a canadian animal rights activist is a free woman after a judge dismissed the mischief charge against her thursday , the guardian reports . according to cbc , the pigs were in a truck headed for an ontario slaughterhouse in 2015 when 49-year-old anita krajnc gave them water , ignoring the truck driver 's orders to stop . she was accused of tampering with private property and giving the pigs an " unknown substance , " the canadian press reports . the farmer who owned the pigs says he was worried krajnc had contaminated them in some way . judge david harris ruled krajnc only gave the pigs water , and since the pigs were still accepted by the slaughterhouse , krajnc did n't " obstruct , interrupt , or interfere with the lawful use , enjoyment , or operation of the property . " by the time the charge was dismissed , krajnc was only facing a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $ 3,600 fine . krajnc 's lawyers say she was acting in the public good and compared her actions to those of nelson mandela and gandhi . following her victory in court , krajnc said she and her fellow activists still have " a lot of work to do " because while the judge ruled in her favor , he also ruled that pigs were property and not persons .
