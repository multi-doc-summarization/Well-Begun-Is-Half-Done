having already killed everything from golf to applebee 's , it looks like millennials have their sights set on the 30-second ad spot . advertisingage reports visa ran two six-second ads during an nfl game on fox last sunday . and t-mobile will follow suit during this sunday 's dallas cowboys game on fox , according to usa today . the six-second spots , which fox first experimented with during the teen choice awards last month , " appear similar to online pre-roll ads . " and one fox executive says they 're about to be commonplace on the network : " this is a new opportunity for advertisers , since it changes how ads can run in games . we are going to expand this to major league baseball broadcasts and every single nfl game starting next week . " six-second ads were first pushed by youtube before being adopted elsewhere on the web . a visa executive says research has shown viewers remember the messaging better in short bursts , and that fox executive says the six-second ads could appeal to millennials and their shorter attention spans . " we know that short-form videos perform better in digital and that consumer attention spans are increasingly shorter , " a t-mobile executive adds . thanks to cord-cutters and dvr 's ability to fast-forward through commercials , fox had little choice but to try something new , fortune reports . fox has said it may insert the six-second ads into down moments of the games themselves , which could make them both harder to skip and allow the actual commercial breaks to be shorterâ€”a bonus for viewers .
