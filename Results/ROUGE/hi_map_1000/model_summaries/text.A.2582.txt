on the verge of the oreo 's 101st anniversary , physicist david neevel has created a futuristic machine designed to undo nabisco 's great mistake—it separates and removes the icky creme from the otherwise wonderful oreo . " once every several generations , an invention comes along that fundamentally alters the course of human civilization , " declares the christian science monitor , which likens neevel 's " oreo separator machine " to gutenberg 's printing press and the steam engine . neevel stars in a humorously dry video demo ( yahoo news likens it to a portlandia sketch ) in which he shares that he worked on his rube goldberg-style machine for " 0.04 years " —aka , " two weeks " —during which he faced major struggles , like how to keep the back of his neck warm . " it was a big time commitment , " he notes , saying he spent " hours at a time " away from his dog and girlfriend , and that he " had to try to find , like , a good sandwich in this part of [ portland , ore. ] and stuff . there were a lot of sacrifices i guess . " but jokes aside , the machine , which employs a hatchet and floss , is pretty nifty , and geekosystem notes that videos of more oreo-separating machines may be coming .
