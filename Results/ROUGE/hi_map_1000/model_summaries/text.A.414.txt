a native american couple is suing minnesota 's department of human services , attorney general , and a commissioner with the mille lacs band of ojibwe , saying the requirement to tell their tribe about their baby violates their right to due process and equal protection . the state law , imposed in 1997 , is intended to keep native american children with native american families . " we know that the children who grow up outside of their culture suffer greatly , ‚Äù says one advocate who has counseled such individuals . " the grief is loss of identity . nonnative homes can not give an adopted indian child their culture . " but mark fiddler , the unidentified couple 's attorney and a chippewa , tells the minneapolis star tribune that they " have the right to make these choices , " and that native american parents " are the only parents in the state that have that duty to notify . " federal law prohibits racial discrimination in adoption except in the case of native american children , and fiddler says this is the first lawsuit he 's aware of that challenges notification requirements . if the parents aborted the child , they would not have to notify , but by choosing to have the baby and not notify they are considered guilty of fraud and the child could be placed in another adopted home . ( the baby , born in april , is currently living with the adoptive parents the biological ones chose . ) the indian child welfare act , meanwhile , could make it more difficult for parents outside a tribe to adopt a native american child in order " to protect the best interest of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families , " reports fox 23 . ( remember the baby veronica saga ? )
