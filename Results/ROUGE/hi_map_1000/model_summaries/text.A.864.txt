a georgia teen who failed to return home from school nearly two years ago has resurfaced in the state with a new look . aubrey jayce carroll , who turned 17 in january , appeared alongside spalding sheriff darrell dix in a video posted to facebook tuesday , sporting long hair and a beard , reports the macon telegraph . though the formerly well-groomed teen did n't detail where he 's been since leaving his griffin home in may 2016 , dix says aubrey " traveled extensively on the west coast and midwest " after joining a group of people who barter and use only cash . " they basically looked like a group of people from the woodstock era in their clothing and lifestyle , " dix notes in a press release , per 11alive , adding aubrey encountered police , including in alabama and alaska , at least five times during his travels . just last year , dix said aubrey 's family was " tortured by the lack of information " about the missing teen . that changed last tuesday , when authorities met with his parents and showed them a facebook page aubrey was using under a different name , reports nbc news . the group decided not to contact the teen for fear he 'd go dark again ( due to his age , he could n't be forced to return home ) , opting to wait until he had another encounter with police . but one relative " went out on a limb " and messaged him anyway and apparently convinced aubrey to contact his mother . he told her he was ready to come home so long as certain conditions were met regarding who he saw and where he went . though much of his time away remains a mystery , dix says aubrey 's " tale was absolutely amazing . he has seen and done things that make your jaw drop . " ( another missing georgia teen was found using snapchat . )
