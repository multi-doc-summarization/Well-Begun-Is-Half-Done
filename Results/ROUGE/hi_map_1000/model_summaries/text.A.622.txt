think you 're soooooo clever naming your baby after a duck dynasty star ? think again : korie and silas are some of the trendy up-and-comers on babycenter 's annual baby names survey , along with other pop-culture-inspired names like george ( after the royal baby ) , kanye ( we wish we were joking ) , and marnie and shoshanna ( after the girls characters ) . korie 's popularity , for example , was up 89 % this year , kanye was up 38 % , and george was up 37 % ... as a girl 's name , nbc news reports . salon notes that the names jesse and skyler were also up in popularity , presumably thanks to breaking bad . but none of the above made it into the top 10 . for boys : jackson aiden liam lucas noah mason jayden ethan jacob jack for girls : sophia emma olivia isabella mia ava lily zoe emily chloe amusing sidenote : the name paula went down in popularity by 20 % . thanks , paula deen ?
