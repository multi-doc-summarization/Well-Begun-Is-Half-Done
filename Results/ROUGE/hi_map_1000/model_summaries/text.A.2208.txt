you can whittle donald trump 's long list of secretary of state candidates down a bit : rudy giuliani has pulled his name out of contention , per trump 's transition team . " rudy giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic american . i will always be appreciative of his 24/7 dedication to our campaign after i won the primaries and for his extremely wise counsel , " trump said in a statement friday . " he is and continues to be a close personal friend , and as appropriate , i will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date . ... rudy would have been an outstanding member of the cabinet in several roles , but i fully respect and understand his reasons for remaining in the private sector . " giuliani will stay on as vice chairman of trump 's transition team , per cnn . as politico puts it , the former new york mayor " had previously publicly campaigned for the post , " and it 's unclear why he 's pulled out of the running for not just secretary of state but any position in trump 's administration , a move the transition team said happened on nov. 29 . reince priebus , who will be trump 's chief of staff , said giuliani had been fully vetted for any potential conflicts of interest and " passed with flying colors , " and that his business ties had nothing to do with his withdrawal . giuliani said in a statement that he still " [ looks ] forward to helping the president-elect in any way he deems necessary and appropriate . " his biggest rival for the secretary of state post was thought to be mitt romney ; other possibilities include exxon ceo rex tillerson , retired adm. james stavridis , sen. bob corker , and former ford ceo alan mulally .
