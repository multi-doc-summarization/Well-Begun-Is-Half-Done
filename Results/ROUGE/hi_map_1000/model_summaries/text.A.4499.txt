a woman who went to the dentist for a tooth extraction ended up dying after flat-lining in his chair , and now the connecticut dentist has been charged with criminally negligent homicide in her death . judith gan , 64 , went into rashmi patel 's office on feb. 17 of last year for a full-mouth extraction , during which 20 teeth would be removed and implants would be inserted . but during the procedure , patel allegedly ignored the sedated woman 's worsening conditionâ€”even though the low-oxygen alarm went off multiple times , gan started gurgling , wheezing , and changing color , and one of patel 's assistants " begged " him to stop working on her , inspectors say . the assistant finally called 911 , but by then gan had stopped breathing and " flat-lined , " according to a health inspectors ' report . she was declared dead at a hospital ; patel has also been charged with evidence tampering . gan had health problems , including a heart attack six months prior to her death and two strokes in the two years prior , the monitor daily reports ; she was also on medication that could have interfered with sedation . " that 's of course an issue into whether she should have been sedated in the first place , " the gan family lawyer says , per fox connecticut . but , he adds , the medical examiner who performed the autopsy " ruled out a lot of potential problems as causes of her death . her pre-existing things did not ... suddenly occur and cause her to die . " officials also say patel , 45 , should not have planned so many procedures at once . the dental commission declined to revoke his license , but it did put him on five years of probation and banned him from performing sedation , the hartford courant reports . he has previously been accused of failing to monitor a sedated patient who choked on gauze but survived , the ap reports , as well as other problems .
