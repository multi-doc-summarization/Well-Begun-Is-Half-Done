seven years after it was found , a 454-year-old shipwreck in the baltic sea is still revealing its treasures . cannons , a hand grenade , possible remains of helmets and swords , and a large grappling hook used to rein in enemy ships are among recent discoveries aboard mars , a swedish warship that sank following a battle in 1564 with danish and german soldiers , reports national geographic . the battle was " an absolute ruckus , " as archaeologist rolf fabricius warming puts it to sciencenordic , describing grenades , lances , and spears hurled from the tops of enemy ships at mars . the vessel had an anti-boarding net , but as many as 400 enemy soldiers were among the 800 to 1,000 on board when a gunpowder explosion at mars ' bow sent it to rest 250 feet below the sea 's surface near Ã¶land . " it was so violent that the front of the ship lies [ 130 feet ] away from the other remains , " says warming , noting any soldiers not killed in the explosion would have drowned . in the latest search of the untouched wreck by divers and underwater vehicles , " we have come closer to the people aboard , " he adds . " we found more skeletal parts , including a femur with trauma around the knee which we believe to stem from a sharp-edged weapon . " but it 's the grappling hook warming finds most exciting . he calls it " totally unique , " noting no other examples from the 16th century exist , except in illustrations . the hook will remain where it lies , however , along with silver treasure previously found . researchers have n't been granted permission to disturb the wreck , which lies in cold , low-oxygen water ideal for preserving wood . ( legend has it the ship was cursed . )
