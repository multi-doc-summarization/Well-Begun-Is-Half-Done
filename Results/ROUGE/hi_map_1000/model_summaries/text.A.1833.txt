students are in an " uproar " —in the words of one parent—after a middle school principal in california forced a 13-year-old to change his clothes thursday . when students at ethan chase middle school were given the opportunity to dress as a disney character for spirit week , eighth-grader austin lacey went " all out , " ktla reports . " i 'm just one of those people , " he says . austin showed up to school in a sparkly blue dress and long blonde wig , unmistakably the trademarks of elsa from the popular film frozen . but he was almost immediately told to take the costume off by his principal . " the principal 's action was based upon the need to stop a general disruption to the school environment , " ktla quotes a statement from the district 's superintendent as saying . but buzzfeed reports that 's not what austin 's mother , brooke francey , heard . lacey " was informed the principal does not agree with boys dressing like girls , " she writes on facebook . and she says the principal told her the same . " the statement made to me was , 'it is not okay for boys to dress like girls or girls to dress like boys . ' " austin , who was told to remove the costume before school even started , says classmates were cool with it and were posing for photos with him . " it was n't a disruption , " a fellow student tells the press-enterprise . " nobody had a problem with it . " according to a second facebook post from francey , students are passing out flyers encouraging everyone to cross-dress next week to support the lgbt community . " this is a real problem , and as students it is our job to fix this , " the flyer states . ( these boys were asked to leave school after dressing as nikki minaj and miss america for spirit week . )
