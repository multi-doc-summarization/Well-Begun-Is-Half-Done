after being rebuffed by scott brown , tagg romney , william weld , and kerry healey , massachusetts republicans finally have at least one candidate for senate . state rep. daniel winslow , who had previously said that he was " 99 % certain " he 'd run , yesterday told the boston globe he was " going to be 100 % running for the us senate . " winslow chipped in $ 100,000 of his own money to start the campaign , but that 's a fraction of the $ 4 million to $ 6 million he estimates the venture will cost . before becoming a state rep , winslow served as chief legal counsel to mitt romney and as a district court judge . he 'll fly to washington on monday to meet with the national republican senatorial committee , presumably in the hopes of securing more funding . at least three other republicans are also publicly considering runs , but every day they delay getting in will make that prospect harder , the boston herald points out , because candidates need 10,000 signatures by feb. 27â€”and generally shoot for 20,000 in case some are challenged .
