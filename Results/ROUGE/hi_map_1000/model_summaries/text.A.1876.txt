think the cia played a role in covering up the john f. kennedy assassination ? now an important source agrees with you : the cia . according to an article written by the agency 's senior in-house historian , the cia purposely held back information from the warren commission , politico reports . john mccone , then the agency 's director , apparently failed to tell the commission about agency plots to murder fidel castro ( including ones involving the mafia ) . so the commission never knew to ask whether lee harvey oswald had cuban comrades dead-set on retaliating against the us president . the commission famously concluded that oswald acted alone , spawning decades of conspiracy theories involving castro , the mafia , the cia , the soviets , and even president lyndon b. johnson . seems the white house nudged mccone along : he " shared the administration â€™ s interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate [ the ] cia in conspiracy theories and possibly lead to calls for a tough us response against the perpetrators of the assassination , " reads the article , which was published in a cia internal magazine in 2013 and declassified ( with 15 redactions ) last fall . mccone also apparently did n't reveal that the cia may have been communicating with oswald before the killing , and was illegally reading his mail after he tried defecting to the soviets in 1959 . the article , by cia historian david robarge , calls mccone 's actions " benign " but says the cover-up played a big role in " undermin [ ing ] the credibility of the commission .
