a florida starbucks has made it easy for deaf customers to order at the drive-thru—and video of one deaf woman 's experience has been viewed more than 6.5 million times since she posted it on facebook tuesday . " starbucks ! this is what i 'm talking about ! " wrote rebecca king . the 28-year-old tells first coast news she was surprised on monday when she drove up to the st. augustine starbucks ordering window and a barista appeared on a two-way video screen to take her order via sign language . she went back the next day to record video of her doing the same thing . " it is a big deal to ( the ) deaf community that starbucks has one now . nowhere else has that ! " says king . " we all want to have that at every drive-thru in the world . " the barista is 22-year-old katie wyble , who tells action news jax she 's had a " passion for sign language since i first saw a teacher use it when i was in preschool " ; she continued to study it in grade school , high school , and college . " i think more people need to know about what we ’ re doing because it moves customer service to a whole new level , ” wyble adds . “ i hope it helps make more people aware of what they can to do serve others in their communities . " st. augustine has a large deaf community and the starbucks in question is brand-new . it 's not clear whether other starbucks locations have the same capability , but the huffington post notes that at least two other chains , culver 's and subway , have installed their own technology to help deaf customers order .
