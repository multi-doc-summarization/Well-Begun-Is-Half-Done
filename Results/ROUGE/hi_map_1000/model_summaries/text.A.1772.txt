people are outraged after video surfaced sunday night showing a passenger being forcibly and violently removed from a united airlines flight that had been overbooked . as the courier-journal reports , four seats were needed on the chicago-to-louisville flight so that crew members could get to louisville for a flight assignment monday morning . passengers were told that volunteers were needed to give up their seats and that they would receive $ 400 , a hotel stay , and a flight the following day . they were told the flight would n't take off until four people had given up their seats , but no one volunteered . the airline then doubled the offer to $ 800 and still no one volunteered . a manager then came on board and used a computer to randomly select passengers who would need to leave the flight . a couple was selected and left , and then the man in the video was selected . he explained that he 's a doctor and had patients he needed to see monday morning , but was told that security would be called if he did n't exit the flight voluntarily . he said he would be calling his lawyer , and eventually , three security officials came onboard , pulled him from his seat , and dragged him down the aisle and off the plane . passengers say everyone on the flight was appalled , and children onboard were scared . the man got back on the plane , reportedly " disoriented " and with his face bloodied , and ran to the back of the plane . a medical crew came aboard and passengers were asked to return to the gate while the plane was " tidied up . " eventually the plane departed two hours late . united has since apologized for overbooking , the week reports , but no update has been given on the passenger who was removed . video of the incident from two different angles is here and here .
