when he discovered his newborn son had down syndrome , a new zealand man living in armenia was horrified not by the condition , but by the assumption that he would n't want to keep little leo . when the boy was born , " the doctor came out , he said , 'there 's a real problem with your son , ' " samuel forrest tells abc . " they took me in to see him and i looked at this guy and i said , 'he 's beautifulâ€”he 's perfect and i 'm absolutely keeping him , ' " he says . but his armenian wife told him she would leave him if he did n't agree to put the boy up for adoption , and when he declined , she filed for divorce a week after the boy was born on jan. 21 . " when a baby like this is born here , they will tell you that you do n't have to keep them , " forrest says . " my wife had already decided , so all of this was done behind my back . " the wife confirmed to abc that she had a baby with down syndrome and has left her husband , but she declined to discuss details . forrest , a freelance business contractor , started a gofundme page for help taking leo to live in new zealand and has had an overwhelming response , tvnz reports . with a $ 60,000 target , he has now raised more than $ 200,000 and plans to use the extra funds to support programs that help abandoned children in armenia and families with disabled children . ( a woman who asked for a few birthday cards for her son with down syndrome received truckloads of responses . )
