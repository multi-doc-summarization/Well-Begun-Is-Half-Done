parisian streets have been paved with stones since the 12th century , and while asphalt now covers large swaths of the city , the cobblestones still adorn squares , boulevards , and alleyways . for years as the city dug them up ( about 10,000 tons a year ) to continue building or repaving , it paid to haul them to the dump , reports the new york times . no longer . it finally occurred to officials last march to salvage these rare gems of parisian history and sell them to contractors so that they 'd have " a second life , " say the head of the city maintenance yard that stores them . " they are cheap and have some charm , " he tells bloomberg . in september , one enterprising woman bought five tons for $ 215 and set up a souvenir shop of sorts , where her team polishes , weighs , and hand-paints the stones . she sells them online for between $ 60 and $ 160 , plus $ 15 to $ 40 in shipping fees . tourists from as far afield as china and oklahoma have paid for what entrepreneur margaux sainte-lag√ºe calls enduring little pieces of history . ( not bad , considering the stones are worth maybe 8 cents as raw material . ) for her , they bring a bit of nostalgia , reminding her of when youth threw them at police during national strikes in 1968 . ( this happened in 1848 as well . ) even the mayor of paris , anne hidalgo , has one of her decorated stones , notes architectural digest . ( paris is designating a wooded area for nudists . )
