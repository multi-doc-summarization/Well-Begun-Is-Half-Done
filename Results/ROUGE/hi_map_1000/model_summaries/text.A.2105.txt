the mlb player with the most hits in the league 's history should be a shoo-in for the hall of fame , but that 's hard to do when you 've been permanently banned from baseball—again . commissioner rob manfred was reportedly set to tell pete rose on thursday he wo n't lift the permanent ban against rose that 's been in place since 1989 , but queries by the new york times appeared to expedite manfred 's announcement , which he made monday instead . mlb.com notes manfred informed rose , both verbally and in writing , of his decision . the " stark language " of the league 's rules dictates " that the penalty for a player or manager who bets on a game in which he has a duty to perform is mandatory , permanent ineligibility , " manfred says in his announcement accompanying the mlb press release . he adds he had instructed staff to gather any new evidence that may have emerged since the 1989 dowd report that helped place rose on the league 's ineligible list , based on evidence rose bet on baseball while managing the cincinnati reds—including bets on his own team . in addition to a polygraph test and a private meeting between rose and manfred in september , that new evidence included an incriminating notebook revealed in a june espn report that indicates rose also bet while still playing for the reds . manfred notes that during that conversation , rose had inconsistent stories , made contradictory statements , and could n't remember important facts from the dowd document . another nugget came to light during manfred and rose 's meeting that appears to have influenced the decision . " significantly , [ rose ] told me that currently he bets recreationally and legally on horses and sports , including baseball , " manfred notes . interestingly , manfred says that while rose wo n't be reinstated , that 's an entirely different issue than whether he should be eligible for the hall of fame , a debate he says " must take place in a different forum .
