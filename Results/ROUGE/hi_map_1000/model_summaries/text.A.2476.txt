it was just another day of typical garden work at a polish museum when a worker 's shovel clanked against something hard buried in the ground . the find : a 20-inch-high marble sculpture of the head of one adolf hitler , afp reports . " somebody made an effort to properly hide it , it was buried some [ 2 feet ] underground , " lech lopuski , a curator at gdansk 's national museum , tells the dziennik baltycki website , via the bbc . inscribed on the bust is " thorak 1942 , " designating it as the work of josef thorak , who was known as one of the fuhrer 's favorite sculptors , per afp . " it 's an important sculpture because we did n't know it existed , " lopuski notes . " thorak was a gifted sculptor , and we can see that he did a good job . " thorak 's works were known to be monumental , designed for use in official buildings and public spaces , per the bbc . while museum officials still are n't sure how this hitler head ended up in the garden—and remained hidden for 70 years , even when work was done to install a new fountain and flower beds , lopuski says—there 's been speculation it was buried in 1945 , just before the soviet army infiltrated gdansk . lopuski theorizes the sculpture may have been part of the furnishings for the office of the museum director at the time , per afp . but just because the hitler head was found on museum grounds does n't mean it will be up for display anytime soon . " for the time being , it goes to a warehouse , " the museum 's director says , per the bbc . " it needs to be studied scientifically to find out who ordered it , where it stood , and how it ended up in the museum . " lopuski adds , per afp : " it 's a delicate issue . " ( hitler 's long-lost bronze horses were just found in may . )
