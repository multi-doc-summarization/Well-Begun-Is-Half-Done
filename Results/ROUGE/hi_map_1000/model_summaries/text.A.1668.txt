" there was a lot of drinking and some drugs . it was really hot in there , " one attendee explains to whdh . an ems official confirms they mostly saw " heat- and alcohol-related symptoms , " and none of the patients were in serious condition . still , dozens of ambulances were called . " everyone was having a good time but then when we left there was ambulances and police officers , " another concertgoer says . another adds , according to cnn , " these concerts should be outside ... i think it was a combination of heat and drugs , more of the latter . " but live nation , the concert promoter , says most of the people hospitalized were actually stopped before entering the venue . " when you have this type of a concert , this techno-rave type thing , we kind of know it may be coming , " the ems official explains . avicii tweeted afterward , " just hearing the awful news abt tonight . its a terrible thing , i rly hope everyone is ok ! my thoughts go to those affected & their families .
