hillary clinton may say she never sent any classified information using her personal email account , but experts and former government officials are n't so sure . as the new york times reports , both democrats and republicans believe the government tends to err on the side of " overclassification " when it comes to making documents secret—more than 80 million documents were classified in 2013—making it difficult to believe that clinton somehow managed to avoid sending information considered sensitive . " as a longtime critic of the government 's massive overclassification , i thought it was a refreshing touch that the secretary of state conducted all her email in unclassified form , " says the director of george washington university 's national security archive with what the times calls " a hint of sarcasm . " clinton 's staff has identified more than 30,000 emails as pertaining to government business , and a former senior state department official says it 's " hard to imagine " none of those were classified . by his estimate , he says , “ i would assume that more than 50 % of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified . " and another expert notes that , had a journalist made a foia request for all of clinton 's email before news of her personal account broke , " it would have been a real surprise if none of it was withheld on the grounds of classification . " but , he adds , " there 's zero chance that she 'll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information , because she decides what 's classified . " clinton also traveled with aides who could have sent classified material from their accounts on her behalf . politico reports that about 900 pages of emails relating to benghazi will be released soon .
