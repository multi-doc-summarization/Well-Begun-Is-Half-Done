secession is all the rage these days , and the latest movement is taking shape in maryland . the western maryland initiative , a group led by scott strzelczyk , is looking to break off the five western counties from the rest of the state , the washington post reports . garrett , allegany , washington , frederick , and carroll counties are more rural ; their residents are mostly white , earn less than their fellow marylanders , and are largely republicans in a very blue state . with about 650,000 residents , they make up just 11 % of the state 's population ; that 's about the size of dc , notes think progress . strzelczyk envisions a state—called western maryland or west maryland , reports the sentinel—with more " personal liberty , less government intrusion . " he 's personally pro-gun , anti-department of education , and ok with medical marijuana . " if you don ’ t belong in [ the democratic ] party , you ’ ll never have your views represented " in maryland , says strzelczyk . " if we have more states , we can all go live in states that best represent us , and then we can get along . " ( he does n't want to move to another state , however . ) but secession is notoriously difficult to achieve , and the sentinel points out that the 3,000 people who have " liked " the group 's facebook page make up fewer than 1 % of the area 's 407,000 registered voters . political experts say the effort is n't likely to see results , and strzelczyk knows he has a ways to go—his effort does n't even have a website yet . ( when it comes to possible secession , northern colorado 's attempt is currently the furthest along . )
