tanning beds have long been associated with skin cancer , and now researchers are quantifying just what that costs the us financially . reporting in the journal of cancer policy , they calculate that in 2015 , the direct medical care for skin cancers resulting from tanning bed exposure totals $ 343.1 million . what 's more , they figure that early deaths and loss of productivity in these cases add up to a $ 127.3 billion loss over the lifetime of individuals currently diagnosed . but those are just dollar signs : the human toll is large , too , with more than 263,000 cases of skin cancer attributed to tanning beds in 2015 alone . the researchers call tanning beds a " significant contributor to illness and premature mortality in the us . " reuters notes that some 30 million americans use tanning beds every year . tanning beds emit uv-a rays , which damage dna , and uv-b rays , which can burn one 's skin and also raise the risk of skin cancer . ( the research did not calculate the medical cost of burns . ) previous research has found that indoor tanning bed exposure in people younger than 35 nearly doubles their risk of melanoma , reports stat news , and americans must now be 18 or older to use them in several states . " women younger than 30 are six times more likely to develop melanoma if they tan indoors , " says a university of alabama researcher who was n't involved in the study . " even one indoor tanning session can increase users ' risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by 67 % and basal cell carcinoma by 29 % . " ( australia has outright banned tanning beds . )
