nasa is cutting off much of its contact and cooperation with russiaâ€”except when it comes to the international space station , which nasa relies on russia to reach . " given russia 's ongoing violation of ukraine 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " all contact with russian representatives are suspended , " unless the activity has been specifically excepted , " an administrator told employees in a memo leaked to spaceref . those excepted activities include any bilateral contacts regarding space station operations , and multilateral meetings including other space station partner nations . nasa is in a tough position . it relies on russia 's soyuz capsules , but the us has banned china from the iss for human rights violations , the christian science monitor explains . " if the united states wants to avoid looking extremely hypocritical , this was going to be coming , " says one space policy expert . nasa soon issued a statement confirming the memo and saying that it was " laser focused on a plan to return human spaceflight launches to american soil . " russia is n't pleased , if this editorial from the state-run ria novosti is any indication . " the statement was way too harsh , " the director of russia 's space policy institute said .
