" as long as the research community takes the dsm to be a bible , we ’ ll never make progress , " he said . " people think that everything has to match dsm criteria , but you know what ? biology never read that book . " among other changes , the new dsm-5 has encompassed four previously separate disorders under the blanket " autism spectrum disorder . " another change : previously , those grieving for a lost love one could n't be diagnosed with depression within two months of the death . now bereavement is actually classed as a trigger . ( psychcentral has a thorough rundown of all the changes . ) john hopkins psychiatry professor paul mchugh has also criticized the new manual in the washington post , saying it encourages doctors to rely on check-lists rather than getting to know their patients .
