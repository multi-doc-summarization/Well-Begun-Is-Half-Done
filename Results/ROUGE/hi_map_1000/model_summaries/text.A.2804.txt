time to nix that belief you 've been clinging to that snakes are " mostly solitary and stupid , " vladimir dinets tells gizmodo . the university of tennessee researcher has found one particular caribbean species that apparently hunts together . dinets ' study in the animal behavior and cognition journal details his research on chilabothrus angulifer , or the cuban boa , which tennessee today notes is the country 's largest resident predator on land and which apparently hunts fruit bats in sinkhole caves in a coordinated way . dinets observed the snakes for eight days in the caves of desembarco del granma national park , where he had noticed they would hang from the ceiling near the entrance at dawn and dusk , ready to pounce when the bats flew in and out of the caves . but it was n't just random positioning . the snakes hunkered down in close proximity to each other , in seemingly strategic locations , so when the bats tried to pass , they were trapped by a " hissing , snapping curtain " of boas , as sciencealert puts it . what signified coordination and not just a shared preference for one location : no snake positioned itself in the same " segment " twice . dinets also notes that one to three snakes were present for each hunt ; only two boas failed to catch a bat , and both were hunting solo . when successful , it took one boa an average of 19 minutes to catch a bat , but three only 6.7 minutes . what 's unclear is how rare this is : there are 3,650 snake species , but the natural hunting habits of just a handful have been studied . " it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out " if others hunt like this , too . ( here 's how boa constrictors actually kill their victims . )
