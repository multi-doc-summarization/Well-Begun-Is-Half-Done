one of the downfalls of being an international pop star beloved by tweens everywhere : sometimes you end up the target of two would-be assassins hired by a convicted killer to murder you . that 's what happened to justin bieber , police say . cbc news and the toronto star have details of the bizarre plot : dana martin , 45 , was both the mastermind and the person who alerted police to the plot . he says he hired new mexico men mark staake , 41 , and staake 's nephew , tanner ruane , 23 , to kill four people . staake and ruane were arrested late last month , but authorities just discovered bieber may have been a target . martin wanted all four of the victims , which were to include both bieber and his bodyguard , strangled with a paisley tie . martin is currently in state prison for murder ; he killed his victims in a similar fashion . martin wanted two of the victims castrated , and was willing to pay $ 2,500 per testicle , but bieber is not believed to be one of those he wanted castrated . martin was obsessed with the singer , having written him letters and gotten a bieber tattoo on his leg . he got upset when bieber never responded to him . if the whole thing sounds like a macabre publicity stunt , there 's reason for that . martin told police " he was seeking a measure of notoriety so that there would be people outside of prison who would know who he ... was . " oh , and he had nothing to lose : he 's serving a sentence of 988 years and change .
