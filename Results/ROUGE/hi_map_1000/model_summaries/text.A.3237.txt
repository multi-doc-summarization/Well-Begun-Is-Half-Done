a battle between the city of san francisco and companies that rent out motorized scooters has come to a head : on tuesday , the board of supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance seeking to regulate the scooters , techcrunch reports . at issue is the fact that the companies—limebike , spin , and bird—started operating three weeks ago without approval from the city , and city authorities say the electric scooters can be dangerous . " we can not overstate the public safety hazard that operating motorized scooters pose on city sidewalks , " said city attorney dennis herrera in a cease-and-desist letter to the companies monday , per slate . the letter ordered the companies to stop operating until a plan was in place to make sure customers stop riding on sidewalks and without helmets or drivers licenses , and stop parking in places that block sidewalks , ramps , and transit stops . ( they do n't require a docking station and can thus be left anywhere when riders are done using them , the ap reports . ) techcrunch says the letter did n't " seem to be making any difference , " as scooters from all three companies were spotted on san francisco streets tuesday . the board of supervisors is looking to put a permitting process in place for the scooter companies similar to the one that exists for bike-sharing companies operating in the city ; it hopes to have the process in place by may 1 . it also plans to establish fines starting at $ 125 when scooter regulations are violated .
