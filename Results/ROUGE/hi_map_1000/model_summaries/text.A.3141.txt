maureen dowd has an unlikely admission from donald trump , after a bruising week in which the brash candidate took heat for re-tweeting an unflattering photo of heidi cruz : " yeah , it was a mistake , " he tells the new york times columnist . " if i had to do it again , i wouldn ’ t have sent it . " of his comments that women who get abortions should be punished , trump also backtracked , telling dowd that " this was not real life . this was a hypothetical , so i thought of it in terms of a hypothetical . so that ’ s where that answer came from , hypothetically . " when dowd wonders whether he was ever involved with anyone who had an abortion when " he was a swinging bachelor in manhattan , " he responds thusly : " such an interesting question . so what ’ s your next question ? " other un-trump-like highlights : on his problems with women voters : " nobody respects women more than i do . i ’ m just going to be myself . that ’ s all i can do . " on rosie o'donnell : " give me a break , rosie . i won ’ t comment on rosie . i wish her the best . see ? in the old days—tell your sister , i ’ m making progress . " ( dowd told trump he 'd lost her sister 's vote with the cruz retweet . ) on his hair : it 's " phenomenal . my hair is just fine , but i get attacked on my hair . but if i attack someone else on their hair , they ’ d say , 'oh , what a terrible thing to do . ' " on whether corey lewandowski should have just apologized : " you ’ re right , but from what i understand it wouldn ’ t have mattered . " the softer side of trump comes as he 's campaigning hard in wisconsin , reports the ap , where he 's gotten a rough reception . " this politics is a tough business , " trump told a rally there saturday . " because you can say things one way and the press will criticize you horribly . you say it another way and the press will criticize you horribly . " the wisconsin primary is tuesday .
