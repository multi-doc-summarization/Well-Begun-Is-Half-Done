" sources told cnn and the ap over the weekend that trump planned to oust shulkin , possibly as early as this week , but that he wanted to have a replacement selected first . pressed on that subject , gidley said , " when the president wants to make a change , he will make it . ... whether he has a replacement or not , he can still make a change .
