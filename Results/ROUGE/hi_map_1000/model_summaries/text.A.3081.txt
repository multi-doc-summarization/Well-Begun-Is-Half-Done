a well-dressed tourist visiting germany from china was robbed in heidelberg , but he filled out the wrong set of paperwork in an attempt to report the crime . known only as mr. l and fluent only in mandarin , he went to the town hall instead of the police station , signed an asylum application instead of a missing item report , handed over his passport , had his fingerprints taken , and was bused 220 miles away to a refugee shelter in duelmen . all the while he did his best at charades to communicate that he just wanted his passport so he could visit italy and france , reports the local . but the 31-year-old had become entangled in the german asylum system , which has processed 1 million refugees in the last year alone , reports the guardian . most have fled syria , iraq , and afghanistan ; very few have sought asylum from china . " he spent 12 days trapped in our bureaucratic jungle because we could n't communicate , " the head of a red cross refugee center tells reuters . the well-dressed man from beijing stood out as it was , and he also clearly had a story to tell . but it was n't until someone went to a local chinese restaurant for help that it was suggested red cross workers use a smartphone app to translate , which did the trick . after more paperwork , which was further delayed by paperwork mishandled when mr. l first entered the country , the tourist was sent on his way south . the entire ordeal took 12 days , and yet he walked away politely and without anger . " he said europe was not what he had expected , " the red cross official says . ( read about another tourist mishap . )
