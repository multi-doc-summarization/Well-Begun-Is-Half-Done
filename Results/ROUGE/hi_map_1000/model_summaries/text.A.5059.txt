washington , dc , could be about to leave the rest of the us behind and move a lot closer to europe , at least as far as family leave is concerned . the dc council backs legislation , to be introduced tuesday , that would give workers 16 weeks of paid leave for events like the birth or adoption of a child , the terminal illness of a parent , or recovery from a military deployment , reports the washington post . the paper notes that the plan applies to almost all workers in the city ( including part-time ) and is more than double anything on offer in any of the 50 states . it will cover 100 % of pay for people making $ 52,000 a year or less ; the maximum weekly pay for the highest earners would be $ 3,000 per week . the new family and medical leave fund would be funded by a levy on employers that the post likens to a state unemployment insurance fund , with employers paying in on a sliding scale that goes up to 1 % of salaries for the highest-paid workers . wamu reports the universal paid leave act of 2015 has the votes to pass the council ; the legislation would then go to the mayor . the dc plan is a big victory for president obama 's push to boost family leave . instead of trying to get legislation through congress , the administration is offering grants to help create state-level paid family leave plans . the administration " has realized the action is on the state and local level , and they gave us the money to model how this could actually work , " dc council member elissa silverman tells the post . " we now have a national platform and a great opportunity with this legislation to show how it can be done . " the us is one of the only countries in the world without paid maternal leave , and experts say that has caused a lower rate of female participation in the labor force , reports the international business times . ( this tech firm offers mothers and fathers a year 's paid leave . )
