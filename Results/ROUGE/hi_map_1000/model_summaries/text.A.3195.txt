the quotes are so incendiary that some are questioning their veracity . but axios reports fire and fury : inside the trump white house author michael wolff has " dozens of hours " of tapes to back up statements that appear in the book . and in an excerpt running in the hollywood reporter , wolff ( who is the co-founder of newser ) explains just how he got access to them . a june 2016 hollywood reporter article may have helped grease things : hope hicks emailed wolff to say trump was pleased with the cover . post-election , wolff says he floated the idea of him coming to the white house " journalistically , as a fly on the wall " to gather information for a future book . trump seemed disinterested in the idea of a book , but " his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around , " writes wolff . and so wolff writes he spent each week at the hay-adams hotel , scheduled appointments with senior staffers , and " plunk [ ed ] myself down , day after day , on a west wing couch . " the excerpt shares other tidbits—how the secret service protested the president 's attempts to lock himself in his bedroom ; how trump 's post-dinner calls to billionaire pals spurred leaks ; how jared kushner and ivanka trump thought anthony scaramucci would be the white house 's saving grace—which trump 's lawyer is now trying to block from release . the washington post reports wolff and his publisher , henry holt and co. , have been sent a letter that demands they " immediately cease and desist from any further publication , release , or dissemination of the book " or any excerpts ; the lawyer also wants a copy and says a libel suit is being considered .
