ohio state sen. tom patton is a term-limited republican who 's now going after an ohio house seat , and he 's running against a real " sweetie . " at least , that 's what the 62-year-old called his chief republican opponent in a radio interview last week , but it 's a separate comment he made about jennifer herold that has drawn the most fire . in a jan. 18 interview with ed ferenc on the america 's work force radio show , he questioned why herold is running while being a young mother , reports the columbus dispatch . " the gal that 's running against me is a 30-year-old , you know , mom , mother of 2 infants , " he said . " i do n't know if anybody explained to her you have to spend three nights a week in columbus . so , how does that work out for you ? i waited until i was 48 , 'til my kids were raised , and at least adults . " herold , who has 1-year-old and 3-year-old sons , took to facebook with a lengthy response in which she asked whether the current legislators with children , mothers and fathers alike , are " all unfit to serve . " she added : " tom , only one man in my life is allowed to call me 'sweetie . ' from now on , i respectfully ask you to refer to me as jen , jennifer , ms. herold , or your opponent . " cleveland.com reports patton has followed up with his own statement in which he " sincerely " apologizes and says his comments were " misunderstood . " he notes that " millions of women " balance work and family every day , including his own daughters : " i used a poor choice of words to express what i know first-handâ€”raising young children and working is tough . " the two will face off in the march 15 gop primary .
