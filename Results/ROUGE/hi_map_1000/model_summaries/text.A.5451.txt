" " i have a message for any young woman who is thinking about running for office and has ever attended a costume party ... or done anything stupid on camera , " ball tells the richmond times-dispatch . " run for office . fight for this country . do n't let this sort of tactic deter you . " the blog that dug up the images is currently down ; for the photos and wonkette 's chortling , click here . ball talked to salon about the pics ; click here for that .
