a newly found creature 's name is the hog-nosed rat , and things do n't get any more picturesque from there . reporting on their find in the journal of mammalogy , scientists describe the animal , found in 2013 on mount dako , on indonesia 's sulawesi island : it 's a long-faced carnivorous creature with " extremely large ears ( ~21 % of head and body length ) [ and ] very long urogenital hairs " —the latter being pubic hairs . co-author kevin rowe tells mashable australia that it 's unclear what purpose the hair serves , though " it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way . both males and females have those long ... hairs , like whiskers . they 're not like human pubic hairs . " among its other features : rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat 's mouth opening is so narrow that it ca n't open it much . " it probably eats worms and insect larvae , just kind of slurping them up . " ( in line with that slurping , it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone , which other mammals rely on to chew . ) knoe reports it 's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 ( here 's another of the team 's finds ) , and recalls the moment the rat was found—twice . rowe , of museum victoria , and lsu museum of natural science curator of mammals jake esselstyn went to check their respective traps , saw what was clear to them was a new species , " came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well . " the rodent was given the name hyorhinomys stuempkei , which the age translates from the greek as " 'hyo ' meaning hog , 'rhino ' meaning nose and 'mys ' meaning rat . " ( another unusual animal-related find : a mysterious , giant , jellylike " thing . " )
