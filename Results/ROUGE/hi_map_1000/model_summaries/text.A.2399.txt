president obama arrived in jamaica last night , and his first stop was the bob marley museum , the bbc reports . obama is the first us president to visit jamaica since ronald reagan did so in 1982 , and he 's apparently a big marley fan : during his 20 minutes spent touring the victorian-style house where the musician lived from 1975 to his death in 1981 , he told the guide , " i still have all the albums . " the stop was an unscheduled one , the ap reports . of course , obama is technically in jamaica not as a tourist , but to discuss energy and security issues with representatives of the 15-country-strong caribbean community group . he 'll spend three days in the caribbean and central america . the ap notes that while there was great excitement in the region when he was first elected , obama 's arrival was greeted with " mostly quiet , empty streets , " with locals having the feeling that the president 's " interest in the region has failed to materialize . " he has not been in the caribbean since 2009 .
