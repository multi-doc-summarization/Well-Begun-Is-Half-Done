tip for russell brand : when accepting an award , maybe do n't joke about the award show sponsor 's nazi ties . the comedian was accepting the oracle award at the british gq men of the year awards in london last week when he made this comment about fashion label hugo boss , which was sponsoring the event : " if any of you know a little bit about history and fashion , you 'll know that hugo boss made the uniforms for the nazis . the nazis did have flaws , but , you know , they did look f -- -ing fantastic , let 's face it , while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality . " later , he added , " we 're selling a lot of these ... they 're flying off the shelves ! " and goose-stepped while doing a nazi salute . the sun reports brand was booted from the after-party over the joke , and the daily mail says the comedian later elaborated on twitter : " gq editor : 'what you did was very offensive to hugo boss . ' me : 'what hugo boss did was very offensive to the jews . ' # gqawards # nazitailor . " gawker posted video of brand 's speech today .
