miami dolphins has been relieved of his duties following the release of ted wells ' independent investigation of misconduct in the locker room , the team announced wednesday . head trainer kevin o'neill also was dismissed . " the language and behavior as described in the ted wells report are against the core values of our organization , " dolphins owner stephen ross said in a statement . " after receiving the report , i conducted my own internal review of the facts to determine the appropriate steps for our organization . jim turner and kevin o'neill are good people who care a great deal about their profession and the players whom they serve , but both exhibited poor judgment at times which led me to this conclusion . " as owner , i first arrived in miami , it has been my goal to have a team which honors our proud tradition and represents our fan base the right way both on and off the field . it is not possible for a team to accomplish its goals when the fundamental values of respect are violated . that ultimately rests on my shoulders and i will be accountable moving forward for making sure that we emphasize a team-first culture of respect towards one another .
