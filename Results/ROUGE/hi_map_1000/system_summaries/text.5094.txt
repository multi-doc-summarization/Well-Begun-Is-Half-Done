justice antonin scalia is shedding little light on the supreme court 's deliberations over president obama 's health care law , but the court ’ s longest-serving justice did deny in an interview aired wednesday night that he had a " falling out " with chief justice john roberts over his decision to join with the court 's liberal members to uphold a central part of the law . " no regrets at all , especially since it 's clear that the thing would have ended up the same way anyway , " scalia said . " the press likes to paint us as nine scorpions in a bottle . that ’ s just not the case. . " cnn notes that the court has been a democratic choice of the conservative jurist , which notes that scalia 's " piers morgan tonight " is joined by professor bryan a. garner , scalia 's co-author of the new book , scalia says he has n't lost any sleep over the result . " that comes up all the time , and my usual response is 'get over it , " he said , per the washington post . " you should not believe what you read about the court in the newspapers because the information has either been made up or given to the newspapers by somebody who is violating a confidence , which means that person is not reliable .
