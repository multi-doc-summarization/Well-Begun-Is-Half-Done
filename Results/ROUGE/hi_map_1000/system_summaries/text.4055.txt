the sentinelese , thought to number between 50 and 200 , have rebuffed all contact with the modern world , firing a shower of arrows at anyone who comes within range , the bbc reports . the two men killed , sunder raj , 48 , and pandit tiwari , 52 , were fishing illegally for mud crabs off north sentinel island , a speck of land in the bay of bengal . their skin is ash-black and their faces moon- shaped with negroid features . they can husk coconuts with their teeth , and use fire , which they hide and guard jealously because they do not know how to make it . with long bows and arrows tipped with iron salvaged from shipwrecks , they are believed to be directly descended from the first human populations to emerge from africa , and have probably lived in the andaman islands for up to 60,000 years . the fact that their language is so different even from other andaman islanders suggests that they have had little contact with other people for thousands of years . this does not mean , however , that they live just as they did 60,000 years ago .
