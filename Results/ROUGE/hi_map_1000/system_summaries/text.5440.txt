there 's something of a whodunit going on in the vatican to discover who leaked pope francis ' environment encyclical on its website monday , three days before the official launch . the vatican said it was just a draft , but most media ran with it , given that it covered many of the same points francis and his advisers have been making in the run-up to the release . on tuesday , the vatican indefinitely suspended the press credentials of l'espresso 's veteran vatican correspondent , sandro magister , saying the publication had been " incorrect . " magister told the associated press that his editor , not he , obtained the document and decided to publish it . " i just wrote the introduction , " magister said in a text message , adding that he had promised his vatican to keep quiet about the scoop . in the draft of the encyclical , francis says global warming is " mostly " due to human activity and the burning of fossil fuels . he calls for a radical change in behavior to save the planet for future generations and prevent the poor from suffering the worst effects of industry-induced environmental degradation .
