the house republican tax bill is drawing fire from the right because of a provision that would completely eliminate a tax credit for adoptive parents . religious groups , as well as house and senate conservatives , say that by eliminating the credit , the proposal goes against the gop ’ s “ pro-life ” platform . the house ’ s chief tax writer has defended the removal of the tax overhaul bill who is also a father to adopted kids , spoke at the heritage foundation about tax reform , and she can exercise her proper and unquestioned right to keep the baby . you can work through foreign countries only to have a nation change its laws and slam the door in your face . to meet an adoptive family is to meet a family with a story , abandoned , or abused child finding a home for a child with special needs . but adoption advocates had been bracing for the end of five years . for 2017 , the federal adoption tax credit was $ 13,570 . an adoption can cost as much as $ 40,000 if a family uses a private agency , according to a survey from adoptive families magazine . adoption advocates are also urging the provision be removed .
