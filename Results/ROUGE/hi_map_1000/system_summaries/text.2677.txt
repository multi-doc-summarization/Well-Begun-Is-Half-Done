rice crop is 228.8 million cwt , up 2.8 million from last month on higher production , the new york times reports . production of the rice , which is grown primarily in the golden state , is expected to drop by 25 percent this year . average all rice yield is forecast at 7,560 pounds per acre , but down nearly 2 percent from the previous year , the ap reports . the state ’ s 2,500 rice growers this year planted just 420,000 acres , about a quarter fewer than usual , because farmers weren ’ t allowed to use water for more , according to the california rice commission . california farmers are beholden to a patchwork of local , state and federal water sources that distribute their annual water supply . more and more farmers are getting less or even no water allocations as the drought drags through its third year . the projected decrease in global 2014/15 total supply is greater than the drop in total use resulting in a decrease in world ending stocks . global production is lowered 0.3 million tons to 482.1 million , still a record , due primarily to forecast reductions for bangladesh , brazil , indonesia , and india , offset partially by an increase in the united states .
