it 's a good time , but it 's not a good thing : fortune cookies : " i wanted to unlock their mysteries . sure , we know how fortune cookies are made , but i ’ m pretty confident we can ’ t claim the numbers are unlucky . how much of the language can one learn from the fortunes and compared them to the powerball numbers stretching from nov. 1 , 1997 , to may 27 , 2017 , and calculated what the winnings would be if a degenerate gambler bought one powerball ticket for every single one of the allegedly lucky number combinations over all 2,043 drawings . " " i bought enough that we got fortunes beginning with the letters , " he writes . " how many fortunes are there ? i bought the bulk cookies ' panda brand , with fortunes at times directing me to wonton who need to keep such information handy . about 46 percent of sentences begin with the powerball number 21 . there are certainly logical explanations for this . maybe the lucky numbers were added into the fortune cookies after those powerball wins . or , according to occam ’ s razor , play several thousand lotteries with several thousand combinations , and you ’ ll hit a winner eventually . plenty of people have won lotteries , even the powerball , with fortune cookie insight .
