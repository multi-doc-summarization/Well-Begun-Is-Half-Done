donald trump is set to be the moderator of a debate hosted by newsmax , and airing on ion television , on dec. 27 in iowa : " our readers and the grass roots really love trump , " said christopher ruddy , chief executive of newsmax media . " they may not agree with him on everything , but they don â€™ t see him as owned by the washington establishment , the media establishment. . " trump adviser michael cohen confirmed it , " the real estate mogul carries weight with a certain element of the conservative base . and that sway seems particularly strong with the tea party wing of the base , which will be a decisive factor in the early primaries that are likely to determine the nominee . the debate , which unlike many recent ones will not be limited to a specific topic like national security or the economy , is sure to be one of the more memorable moments in a primary season that has already delivered its fair share of circus-like spectacle . " he 's not clear whether any candidates have actually agreed to take part in the forum , but will be hosted by a man best known for his reality tv show , and a six-figure line of credit at tiffany & co . but given trump 's ability to command media attention , and his willingness to criticize if he disagrees with a candidate , candidates may feel compelled to attend .
