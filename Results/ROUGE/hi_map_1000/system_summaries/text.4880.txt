survivors of one of australia 's deadliest wildfires are to be awarded nearly 500 million australian dollars ( $ 470 million ) in a class action settlement reached tuesday , the largest such compensation in the nation 's history . the fire , which killed 119 people , was the biggest in a series of blazes that tore through the southern australian state of victoria in 2009 , leaving 173 people dead and destroying more than 2,000 homes in just over a single day . more than 5,000 people joined the class action against electricity provider sp ausnet , arguing the company was negligent because it had n't maintained its power lines , which sparked the fire . " it has been a tough , grueling five years since the fire killed our son , left our daughter without her big brother and destroyed our home , " watson told reporters in melbourne . " but this settlement of nearly $ 500 million represents a measure of justice and some real compensation that will ease the financial burden of their suffering . " sp ausnet 's position has been , and continues to be , that the conductor which broke and which initiated the fire was damaged by lightning , compromising its fail-safety design in a manner which was undetectable at the time , " it said in a statement that it had agreed to the settlement , but had not admitted liability .
