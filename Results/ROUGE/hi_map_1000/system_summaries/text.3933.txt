harvard study found that overall , graduation rates at american higher education institutions have declined by 33 percent since 2002 , surveying students who enrolled in 1996 and 2002 , respectively . on harvard 's heels are yale university and the university of virginia had the highest graduation rate in 2008 at 93 percent , followed by the college of william and mary and the us of notre dame , with rates of 97 and 96 percent . among public research universities , the chronicle also found that 33 percent of universities showed a lower graduation % in 2008 than in 2002 . because rates can spike up or down in a particular year , we also show a separate comparison that tends to reduce the effect of those outliers on differences in colleges ' rates over time . to make this comparison , we averaged each college 's rates in 2003 and 2008 with rates in the immediately preceeding years , then compared the averages . to further illustrate changes over time at each college , and see the chronicle for a complete list . what do you think of these findings ? let us know in the comments section . *some institutions included in the study , such as golden gate university and alliant international university , enrolled few students -- 50 or less -- who were classified as full-time by government criteria and thus eligible for inclusion in the federal survey of graduation rates from 2002 to 2008 .
