" " swarms of spiders are rare , although they have been reported , usually after flooding when the spiders were due to the venom , which triggered cardiac arrest in both the victims . but all the bite patients first went to witch doctors , who cut open their wounds with razors , drained out blood and burnt it . that could have also made them sick . also , we did n't administer any antivenin dose , as we were not sure if the spider was venomous , " he said . " we can not say for sure that the fatalities it triggered could have been certainly avoided had there been enough awareness among laymen and mandarins about arachnids.jintu spent a day at the sadiya civil hospital after he complained of excruciating pain and nausea . when he returned home , he had more terrifying stories to tell . terror was still writ large on his face even two weeks after the incident , but he thanked his stars for being alive .
