a man armed with an ar-15 saved a neighbor who was being attacked with a knife monday in oswego township , illinois . police say thomas has a valid firearm owner 's identification card and a concealed carry permit . neighbor dave thomas , who witnessed the attack , went into his home , got his rifle and ordered the suspect to stop . " i ran back into the home , into my house and grabbed my ar-15 . grabbed the ar-15 over my handgun . it 's just a bigger gun . i think a little bit more than an intimidation factor definitely played a part in him actually stopping . " thomas says he is also a firearms instructor . thomas said , " the ar-15 is my weapon of choice for home protection . it ’ s light , it 's maneuverable . if you train and know how to use it properly , it ’ re not dangerous . and this is just a perfect example of good guy with an intimidation stopped a bad guy with a good guy . and there were no lives taken , so all in all it was a good day .
