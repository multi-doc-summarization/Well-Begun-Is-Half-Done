former san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick , who refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality against black people , showed their solidarity with him and his cause at a rally outside nfl headquarters wednesday , demanding that he be signed by a team before the national football league season starts next month . they gathered outside the nfl 's new york city headquarters on wednesday to show their support for the free agent , who once played in the super bowl but has n't been signed by any football club . some critics say it 's about his ability as a player . others say he should have stood for the anthem . the naacp sent a letter to the football commissioner , roger goodell , that it 's " no sheer coincidence " kaepernick is unsigned . " i do n't care how long you 've been watching football , if they do n't stand up for your children , turn the damn tv off , " he said . " the nfl has proven with their treatment of colin kaepernick that they do not mind if black players get a conscience . "
