the younger sister of the duchess of cambridge has been getting $ 1.5 million to pen a book about party planning and etiquette , reports the telegraph . it is understood that publisher michael joseph , an imprint of penguin books , last week signed her up to a publishing deal worth Â£400,000 , the ap reports . " she wanted to publish it next year , but it will be timed to come out after the jubilee , " says one book industry insider . " and i 'm not the only one who thinks this is a bad idea ; not many people are fans of pippa 's alleged contract . the u.k. economy is not that great and to hand over money for a fluff piece written by someone related to kate middleton is ticking off a lot of britons . and i 'd have to agree that it 's midly perturbing . pippa seems like a smart , beautiful and resourceful woman -- she does n't need anything handed to her . kate 's coattails probably look like a lot in her bra with bottles of booze in the background ? sounds fun , but ... that does n't really necessarily display the characteristics of someone who 's a supposed expert on manners , decorum , and propriety . her family owns a party supplies business so pippa is no stranger to the game , but to say that kate has nothing to do with this humongous book deal would be a bit unfair . there are plenty of successful , well-known party planners in this world who could actually share tried and true tips on throwing the best fete , but pippa is n't one of them .
