the south african government has begun the process of seizing land from owners in cases where the negotiation for compensation has stalled . two game farms in the northern province of limpopo are the first to be targeted for unilateral seizure after negotiations with the owners to purchase the properties stalled . while the government says it intends to pay , owners akkerland boerdery wanted 200 million rand ( $ 13.7 million ) for the land , but is being offered just 20 million rand , $ 1.87 million , reports the ap . the owners obtained an injunction to hold off eviction until a court had ruled on the case . the application was opposed by the department of rural development and land affairs . in may , the keys to the farm be handed over within seven days , forcing them to seek legal representation and file an urgent application to the courts . the notice demanded that the decision was delivered on very short notice during a long weekend of south african public holidays in march . steenkamp told newsweek that the seizures go ahead , it would be the first time the state refuses to pay market value for land . since the end of apartheid in 1994 , the country would go ahead with plans to change the constitution .
