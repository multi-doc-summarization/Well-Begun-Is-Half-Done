with big round eyes , a pretty pink color and a small , squishy body , an octopus never looked cuter . in fact , the california researcher who ’ s faced with naming this unclassified species living in the depths of monterey bay is considering a title that conveys its adorableness . " as someone that ’ s describing the species you get to pick what the specific name is , " stephanie bush , postdoctoral , tells science friday . " one of the thoughts i had was making it opisthoteuthis adorabilis , because they ’ re really cute . " the octopus , who is working in the video above , from science friday this week , saying it 's " really cute. " and " might become part of its scientific identity . " " it involves publishing papers , collecting specimens and distributing them with the fins on their mantle , " bush said . " and in order to have a healthy functioning ocean ecosystem we need to understand the ecology and behavior of the individual species . " ( the octopus has been collected as far back as 1990 . )
