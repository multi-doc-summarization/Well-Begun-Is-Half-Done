hillary clinton slammed donald trump and issued a strong defense of the clinton foundation wednesday amid the republican nominee 's claims that she used public office for personal gain . speaking to cnn 's anderson cooper in her first national news interview in nearly a month , clinton pushed back against trump 's accusations and issued perhaps her most succinct answers on her use of a private email server during her time leading the state department . " what trump has said is ridiculous , " clinton said . " my work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces . i made policy decisions based on what i thought was right . " she added : " i know there 's a lot of smoke , and there 's no fire . " trump 's husband , former president bill clinton , has laid out some steps the foundation will take if his wife wins . it will only accept donations from us citizens , legal residents and us-based independent foundations , and the 42nd president will step down from the board and stop fundraising . asked by cooper about why she is waiting until a possible presidency to make the changes rather than implement them immediately , clinton said , " obviously , there will be some unique circumstances .
