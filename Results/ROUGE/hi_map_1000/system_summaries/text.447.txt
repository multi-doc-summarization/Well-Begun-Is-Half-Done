boko haram must be quaking in their boots , but now the west has a hashtag campaign . # bringbackourgirls has exploded across social media , powered by a desire to reunite 200 kidnapped nigerian girls with their parents as well as a strong sense of outrage . facebook and twitter are well adapted mediums for protest , yet often the complaints made were not against boko haram , but against what was seen as the full picture of what is taking place on the ground . " it felt good to lend a hand and to know that my contributions made a difference in various campaigns . but i think hashtag activism should be used judiciously , especially when it comes to issues affecting the black community , at home and abroad . in some situations , it risks offering users of social media a false sense of accomplishment that may be more effective in the long term . i especially worry about how the # bringbackourgirls campaign will turn out when i think of some examples from the past : u.s. courts are still systematically breaking down affirmative action , joseph kony is still free and george zimmerman got the best of the independent without the ads hashtag activism is a new phenomenon and campaigning in this way has its faults . it can be a brilliant way to bring a campaign to people 's attention , but presumably those using the hashtag # bringbackourgirls want to do more than just spread awareness-they want those girls brought home .
