drivers in california can legally read a map on their hand-held cellphones while behind the wheel , a state appeals court ruled thursday . the 5th district court of appeal reversed the case of a fresno man who was ticketed on a cellphone . the driver , steven spriggs , challenged the $ 165 fine . but spriggs said he 's no champion of those who think they can get away with cruising down the road while staring at their phone or engaging in other such dangerous behavior . spriggs also noted that the legislature later passed a law that prohibits using a cell phone to send or receive a text message while driving , unless the phone is entirely voice-activated . a highway patrol officer saw him holding the phone and pulled him over . spriggs challenged his ticket , but lower courts agreed with prosecutors that the law forbids after the one at issue in spriggs that " it 's dangerous to talk on your cell phone while driving . " the ruling is the first appellate interpretation of a 2006 state law that restricts people from talking on their cellphones without a hands-free device could have been written more clearly , but it does n't apply to looking at maps on cellphones .
