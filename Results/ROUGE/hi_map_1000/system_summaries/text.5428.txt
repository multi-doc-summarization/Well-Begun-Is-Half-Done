if people were distracted , they ate less , almost 89 % of the food they put on their plates , according to a new cornell university study . " if you put it on your plate , it 's going into your stomach , " says brian wansink ph.d. , author of the cornell food and brand lab and the study 's lead researcher . " just knowing that you â€™ re likely to consume almost all of what you serve yourself can help you be more mindful of appropriate portion size , " he said . " it appears few of them do . " wansink , who frequently studies eating habits , conducted the research with katherine abowd johnson , a doctoral student at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health . wansink , france , taiwan , finland , and the netherlands , the results were nearly identical in a gap in studies about how much people ate when they served themselves . " this might be because kids are less certain about whether they will like a particular food , " wansink says . " regardless , this is good news for parents who are frustrated that their kids do n't clean their plate . "
