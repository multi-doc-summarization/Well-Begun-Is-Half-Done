a judge on friday ruled there was enough evidence to try an antigua man accused of hiring a drug dealer to kill his wife at a la mirada park in 1992 , the ap reports . leon martinez , the convicted shooter , testified thursday at the preliminary hearing that ghonim hired him for $ 10,000 to kill victoria ghonim , 17 , in a staged robbery while the couple were at creek park in la mirada on july 23 , 1992 . at the time , authorities were told that a man walked up to the family car , tried to rob the couple and shot victoria ghonim several times . but robbery was not the motive behind the shooting . the 43-year-old ghonim will be sentenced dec. 19 at norwalk superior court , davila-morales said . " so essentially this is a 20-year-old murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife who hates mr. ghonim , wants to see him in prison and promised to send him to hell , " gorin says . " she said , ‘ don ’ t hurt my baby. ’ i had no intention of hurting the baby . "
