syria 's civil war has prompted the first withdrawal of seeds from a “ doomsday ” vault built in an arctic mountainside to safeguard global food supplies , officials say on monday . television crews stand outside the global seed vault before the opening ceremony in longyearbyen february 26 , 2008 . reuters/bob strong the seeds , including samples of wheat , barley and grasses suited to dry regions , have been requested by researchers elsewhere in the middle east to replace seeds in a gene bank near the syrian city of aleppo that has been damaged by the war . " this fall—october 2016—we had extreme weather in svalbard with high temperatures and a lot of rain—very unusual , " says brian lainoff , a spokesman for the crop trust , which opened on the svalbard archipelago in 2008 , is designed to protect crop seeds - such as beans , rice and wheat - against the worst cataclysms of nuclear war or disease . it has more than 860,000 samples , from almost all nations . even if the power were to fail , the vault would stay frozen and sealed for at least 200 years . the aleppo is delicious , but that ’ s not the whole story . on its website , the water made it about 15 meters into the 100 meter tunnel and then stopped , freezing solid . the volume of the water that leaked in is unknown . even before the events of october 2016 , statsbygg had already planned to take measures to waterproof the tunnel , which had an established tendency to let water in during the spring melt .
