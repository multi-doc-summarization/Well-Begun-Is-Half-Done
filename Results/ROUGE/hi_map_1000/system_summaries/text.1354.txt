a federal judge on tuesday rejected a proposed settlement between google inc. and book authors and publishers as unfair and inadequate , dealing a new setback to the internet giant 's ongoing effort to push its digital-books business forward on a more solid legal footing . judge denny chin wrote in an opinion filed in u.s. district court for the southern district of new york that the agreement “ would simply go too far ” in terms of allowing google goog , +0.73 % to establish a business arrangement that grants it the right to provide copyrighted works on its books service , apart from those actively withheld by copyright owners . in his ruling on tuesday , chin wrote that his concerns about the agreement could be eased by converting it to an “ opt-in ” arrangement for copyright owners , rather than “ opt-out. ” he urged the parties to consider revising the agreement . hilary ware , google ’ s managing counsel , said in a written statement , " this is clearly disappointing , but we ’ ll review the court ’ s decision and consider our options. . " google has been recently elevated to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit , but handled the case as a district court judge .
