mitt romney , a former judge and onetime secretary of state john f. kerry yesterday , has donated $ 100,000 of his own money to jumpstart his campaign , which he estimated will cost between $ 4 million and $ 6 million , reports the los angeles times . " i ’ m going to give this everything i ’ ve got , with all that i have , because the crisis confronting our country demands nothing less , " winslow said . " this is a heavy lift . i 'm going to be 100 percent running for the us senate , " he says . " we ’ re going to use a combination of paid vendors and an army of volunteers to get this done . " winslow , 54 , is a second-term state representative from norfolk who served as romney 's chief legal counsel from 2001 to 2005 . before that , he will resign from his law firm , proskauer , where he is flying to washington to meet with republicans on capitol hill and with the national republican senatorial committee , which controls much of the party 's national fundraising . winslow , who launched an exploratory committee tuesday , said he is confident he can get all the signatures , even though candidates usually must collect up to 20,000 signatures in case some aren ’ t accepted .
