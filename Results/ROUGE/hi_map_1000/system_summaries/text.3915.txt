a southwest flight was forced to turn around after a human heart meant for donation was accidentally left on board , the ap reports . the heart had arrived sunday at seattle-tacoma international airport , where it was n't until after the pilot took off for dallas that the airline realized a " life-critical cargo shipment " was still on the aircraft , southwest said in a statement . " we made the decision to return to seattle to ensure the shipment was delivered to its destination within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer , " the airline says , per the bbc . the captain told passengers that the heart should have been left in seattle after an earlier flight from sacramento . " my understanding is the pilot made an announcement when they turned around that they were returning because there was a story with a lot of misinformation , " he said . " they emailed some reporters and the story ensued . " the heart was unharmed and reached its destination on time , according to sierra donor services public education and relations manager deanna santana . that set-off a social media firestorm as doctors and fellow passengers who happened to be on board started raising concerns online and otherwise that the lost heart would n't be viable . donated tissue also does n't travel with a person inside a plane 's cabin . it flies in a thermally-controlled box in the cargo hold . while a courier for lifenet waited for pickup in seattle , the tissue was left behind , just like a suitcase . but additional details , including its intended destination and what it was being used for , remain unclear .
