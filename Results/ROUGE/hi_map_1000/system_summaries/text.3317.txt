hillary clinton just endorsed a policy that , if implemented , could give a huge advantage to her primary opponent bernie sanders . on tuesday , clinton laid out a broad plan for curbing the influence of money in politics that includes everything from overturning the supreme court â€™ s citzens united ruling to introducing new disclosure rules for federal contractors donating to campaigns . but one of the effects of such a system is that it would substantially strengthen the fundraising power of campaigns like that of bernie sanders , which rely on aggregating a large amount of small donations from a broad base of donors . sanders and biden have a higher net favorability rating than clinton and higher ratings for honesty and empathy . clinton has the best scores for leadership and temperament to handle an international crisis . " sen. bernie sanders has become the eugene mccarthy of 2016 , " said peter director of the quinnipiac university poll . " he is the candidate of the democratic left , against his own party 's bosses and their prized presidential candidate , secretary hillary clinton . " sanders has seized the momentum by offering a message more in line with disproportionately liberal primary and caucus voters .
