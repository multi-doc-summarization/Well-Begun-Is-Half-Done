a federal appeals court upheld key parts of texas 's strict anti-abortion law on tuesday , a decision that could leave as few as seven abortion clinics in the nation 's second largest state . the decision by the 5th u.s . circuit court of appeals upholds that abortion clinics meet hospital-level operating standards , which owners of small clinics say demand millions of dollars in upgrades they ca n't afford and will leave many women hundreds of miles away from an abortion provider . but the court said abortion clinics failed to prove that the restrictions would unduly burden a " large fraction " of women . republican gov . greg abbott and other conservatives say the law is a thinly veiled attempt to block access to abortions in texas , and they promised to appeal to the u.s. supreme court , which temporarily sidelined the law last year . " not since before roe v. wade has a law or court decision had the potential to devastate access to reproductive health care on such a sweeping scale , " said nancy northup , president and ceo of the center for reproductive rights . texas will be able to start enforcing the restrictions in about three weeks unless the supreme court steps in texas would require a 1,200-mile round trip to san antonio , or they would have to cross the border into new mexico .
