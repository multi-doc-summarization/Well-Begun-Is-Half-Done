about 15 gunmen ambushed two vans carrying millions in jewels wednesday on a french highway , forcing out their drivers in the middle of the night and speeding off into the burgundy countryside , a police official says . the perpetrators escaped in four cars and the two vans , which police later found burned and abandoned near the site of the attack , the official said . forensic investigators in white suits examined the area around the charred vans amid vineyards in the dead of night and made off with a haul worth €9m ( £6.3m ) . no possible suspects have been named in wednesday 's theft , according to sources close to the investigation . " they are probably men who stem from organised crime and who are well informed . there were no shots fired and everything happened at lightning speed , " a police source said . the large vans was in 2009 when armoured van driver toni musulin escaped with his vehicle after two of his colleagues stepped away , making off with at least €11.5m in cash collected from a bank of france building . musulin became an overnight internet sensation at a harry winston boutique in paris , when three cross-dressing gunmen stole about $ 92 million in goods .
