" with the cost of $ 25,000 for taking one pint of water to the moon , this was going to be a very energy-intensive endeavor to separate these elements from the lunar rocks and soil . now we have ready sources of water that can not only be consumed by plants and humans , but also broken up into its constituent elements , oxygen and oxygen – to make rocket fuel , " says the study 's lead author , yang liu , at the university of tennessee at knoxville . " this is paramount to human settlement of the moon in the near future , " he said . " we did have the understanding that the moon has done is look at a new source of lunar water .
