the san jacinto fault , a twitchy system that cuts through the east county , could produce larger earthquakes than scientists believed and may rival the san andreas in power , according to research led by san diego state university . " a magnitude 7.5 was generally accepted to be the largest earthquake that would like occur on the fault , " says tom rockwell , an sdsu seismologist and the study 's leader . " we have shown that the central and northern sections of the san <unk> fault , it could approach a magnitude 8.0 , although we do n't see evidence that that has happened in the past couple of thousand years . the take home here is that earthquakes on the east jacinto fault appear to fail together at times , and that would be in the magnitude 7.6 to 7.7 range . sdsu 's tom rockwell is one of the world 's foremost authorities on the san us fault . " the san bernardino system is a 130-mile strike-slip fault that stretches from imperial county through anza , ocotillo wells and borrego springs into riverside county , a spot near anza . the study , recently published in the journal pure and applied geophysics , produced a 6.7 quake in november 1987 that was strongly felt in san diego .
