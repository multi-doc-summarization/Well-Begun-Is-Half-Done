it is in the best interests of the transparency and fairness to the american people , representatives charlie rangel and maxine waters , and other members of the u.s. house of representatives , that the house ethics committee stop the resolution of the rangel and waters matters and complete those public trials prior to the november elections , reports politico . " the chairwoman has repeatedly refused to set either the rangel or waters trial before the november election , " the republicans wrote in a statement released tuesday . " while we regret that the committee has not worked together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure the transparent and fair resolution of these matters to date , we look forward to working with the chairwoman in a <unk> manner to accomplish this â€“ and has expressed frustration over the decision by bonner and the other four republicans to go public with their complaints about lofgren , " per the bbc . the ethics committee has been struggling to set a date for the public trials , but last week says she would like to have a chance to clear his name before the election , but republicans and democrats were still at an impasse as of late last week .
