prime minister benjamin netanyahu said thursday that israel will destroy the hamas tunnel network in the gaza strip " with or without a cease-fire , " as the military called up another 16,000 reservists to pursue its campaign in the densely-populated territory . netanyahu 's vow came as international efforts to end the 23-day-old conflict seemed to sputter despite concern over the mounting death toll , with more than 1,300 palestinians , almost all of them soldiers , killed since july 8 . " acknowledging a call by the united nations and in consideration of the situation of our people , resistance factions on friday as long as the other side abides by it , " hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri tells reuters . " therefore i will not agree to any offer that does not allow the military to complete this important mission for the security of the people of israel . " an initial israeli aerial campaign against hamas was widened into a ground offensive on july 17 . since then the campaign has concentrated on destroying more than 30 cross-border tunnels that militants have constructed to carry out attacks on israeli territory . israel says that most of the 32 tunnels it has uncovered have now been demolished and that getting rid of the remainder will take no more than a few days .
