ali won the world heavyweight title for the first time aged just 22 , beating sonny liston to muhammad ali , who has died at the age of 74 . " we don ’ t have an official cause of death yet , but it has to be from complications of parkinson ’ s. , " he said . " ali was doing color on abc with howard cosell . ali couldn ’ t be any kinder one-on-one . he gave foreman advice on how to handle being the champion , like he was a great athlete , but the greatest publicity man i ’ ve ever known . he would do anything you asked [ promotional-wise ] and would think of a lot of himself . " he also refused to be drafted into the army during the vietnam war because of his religious beliefs , resulting in him losing his licence and world title . " like everyone else on the planet , michelle and i mourn his passing , " caplan says . " but we 're also grateful to god for how fortunate we are to have known him , if just for a while ; for how <unk> we all are that the greatest chose to grace our time . "
