a swiss electrical engineer has crossed the atlantic and the pacific , passed through the world aboard a ship powered entirely by solar energy . it would be an adventure and a statement . if he could do it , he would prove to the world that there are other alternatives to powering sea travel besides fossil fuels and wind . it is expected to cross the official finish line , having proved that solar energy can power a boat all the way around the world . " we have shown that we have the technologies as well as the knowledge to become sustainable and safeguard our blue planet , " says domjan . " i am based , the boat was conceived as a test concept rather than something to be replicated for wide commercial use . still , the voyage dovetails with some rethinking in the shipping industry about hull and engine designs that improve fuel efficiency . and some operators are moving toward having their ships travel more slowly so that they guzzle less fuel . once the arrival festivities are over , mr. domjan plans to take some time off at home in switzerland . but then it â€™ s back to work . the plan is to have a book and a film documentary ready by sept. 27 , two years to the day after the planetsolar set off from monaco on its world trip .
