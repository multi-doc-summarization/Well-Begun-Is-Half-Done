three lawmakers refused to attend the idaho senate 's daily invocation after objecting to the offering of a hindu prayer . rajan zed , guest chaplain , gave a lengthy prayer in both english and sanskrit on tuesday that focused on selflessness and peace . senators from both sides of the aisle shook his hand and thanked him for coming . " fulfill all your duties , action is better than inaction , " zed said . " even to maintain your body , you are obligated to act . selfish action imprisons the world . act selflessly , without any throughout of personal profit . " clad in a flowing orange robe , zed told the senate , first in sanskrit and then in english , “ strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world ; by devotion to selfless one attains the supreme goal of life . do your work with false gods , very ancient . i didn ’ t mind . hinduism is more embracing , ” he said . “ i think it 's great that hindu people can practice their religion but since we 're the senate . we 're setting an example of what we , idaho , believe .
