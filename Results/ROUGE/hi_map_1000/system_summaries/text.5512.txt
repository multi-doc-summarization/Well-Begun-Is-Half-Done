the first map showing the world 's hidden groundwater was published on monday , bringing us closer to estimating how much there is , and when it will run out if we over-use the resource . using data and computer models , an international team of researchers estimated that less than six percent and perhaps as little as one percent of water found close to the earth 's surface is renewable in a human lifetime . " this has never been known before , " tom gleeson of canada 's university of victoria and the lead author of the study tells the ap . " if properly managed it flows to rivers during times of drought so it 's a valuable and strategic resource for mitigating the extreme impacts of climate on water availability . " the study notes that water found deeper in the earth is often used for agriculture and industry . " groundwater can and should be thought of as a very useful buffer to climate extremes , " he said . " we already know that water levels in lots of aquifers are dropping . we 're using our groundwater resources too fast . "
