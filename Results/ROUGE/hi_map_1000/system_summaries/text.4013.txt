a wild turkey has found no violations with an infamous arkansas event that involves dropping live turkeys from a plane ― but that may be because no one ever thought they ’ d need a rule about that . " faa regulations do not specifically prohibit dropping live animals from aircraft , possibly because the authors of the regulation never anticipated that an explicit prohibition would be necessary , " an faa spokesman tells huffpost . " a lot of flightless birds have wings that can produce lift ; it 's just not enough to fly , " he said . " this does not mean we endorse the practice. . " the van pilot has flown a plane and dropped domestic turkeys from an annual festival event that has drawn opposition from animal-rights activists . while turkeys ca n't flap their wings and soar as many other birds can , they can slow their falls somewhat , michael habib , a professor of anatomy at the university of illinois physics department , when birds fly , their wings push air down and generate thrust , pushing the bird up . and as the wings come up , they bend and push less air because they are n't spread out anymore .
