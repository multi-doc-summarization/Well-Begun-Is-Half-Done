senate president susan wagle took the unusual step thursday night of issuing a step back to the 1890s with a " sincerely held religious belief " against same-sex marriage in advance of courts striking down kansas ' constitutional amendment banning the practice . " a strong majority of my members support laws that define traditional marriage , protect religious institutions and protect individuals from being forced to violate their personal moral values , " wagle says . " it won ’ t be immediately , but we ’ re going to work on this together , " he said . " the kansas legislature should never advocate discrimination of any kind based on a perceived notion of religious freedom . " wagle , the kansas house passed the bill to her chamber , would need democratic support to pass the 40-member chamber , an unlikely prospect since democrats are lined up against it . senate minority leader anthony hensley of topeka applauded wagle ’ s comments . " i have talked to the senate president , we believe would have made the bill more acceptable , and if the senate chooses to move forward with hearings , we look forward to working with them to draft language that will protect the religious liberties of all kansans , while at the same time ensuring the dignity of gay and lesbian couples across the state , " witt said .
