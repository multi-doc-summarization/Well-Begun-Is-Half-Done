malaria mosquito species in the west african country of mali has resulted in a " super mosquito " hybrid that 's resistant to insecticide-treated bed nets . " it 's 'super ' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides on treated bed nets , " said medical entomologist gregory lanzaro of uc davis , who led the research team . the research , published jan. 6 in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , " provides convincing evidence indicating that a man-made change in the environment -- the introduction of insecticides -- has altered the evolutionary relationship between two species , in this case a breakdown in the reproductive isolation that separates them , " says the research . " what we provide in this new paper is an example of one unusual mechanism that has promoted the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in one of the major malaria mosquito <unk> . " in a previous study , we reported two bouts of hybridization observed in the town of selinkenyi , mali in 2002 and 2006 . the number of people infected fell from 173 million in 2000 to 128 million in 2013 â€“ a reduction of 26 % . this has occurred despite a 43 % increase in the african population living in malaria , a. coluzzii inherited the entire a. gambiae-associated 2l divergence island , which includes a suite of insecticide-resistance alleles . they are now recognized as separate species .
