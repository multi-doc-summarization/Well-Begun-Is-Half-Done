president obama made a surprise appearance in the white house briefing room friday to share his thoughts on the acquittal of george zimmerman in the shooting death of trayvon martin , saying it is important to look at the case through the lens of past discrimination . " trayvon martin could have been me 35 years ago , " the nation 's first african-american president says . " and it ’ s important to recognize that the african american community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn ’ t go away . " obama , who last year said the 17-year-old florida shooting victim could just as easily have been his son , talked about how he has been subjected to casual prejudice . he also said african americans need to address the problems of violence in their own communities . " there are very few african american men who have n't had the experience of being followed in a department store . that includes me , " he said . " those sets of experiences inform how the african-american community interprets what happened one night in florida . "
