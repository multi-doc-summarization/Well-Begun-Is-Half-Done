a bomb blast tore through a subway train deep under russia 's second-largest city monday , killing 11 people and wounding more than 40 in a chaotic scene that left victims sprawled into black bags and cardboard boxes , and household containers with an unidentified powder inside . the investigative committee , the state body leading the investigation , said footage from security cameras near the same building showed the suspect , akbarzhon jalilov , leaving home carrying a bag and a rucksack . it did not specify if that was on the day of the attack . jalilov was born in 1995 in kyrgyzstan , a mainly muslim ex-soviet republic in central asia , and held a russian passport . if it is proven that he was motivated by militant islamist ideology , that will test russian president vladimir putin 's policy of military intervention in syria . some russians may decide their country 's intervention is making them a target for reprisal attacks by islamists instead of making them safer as putin had told them would happen . " from now on , i will be scared to take the subway , " said marina ilyina , 30 , who brought flowers to the station where the train stopped after the bombing . " we in st. petersburg thought we would n't be touched by that . "
