the baltic sea is a graveyard of ships that have sunk over the past few centuries , in particular the two world wars , the ap reports . scattered amongst the wreckage , a team of scientists led by philippe jeandet , a professor of food biochemistry at the university of reims , was able to obtain a small sample of the preserved beverage for testingâ€”and tasting . " the baltic wine we analyzed contained at least 140 grams of sugar per liter , as compared to about 6 to 8 grams per liter used today. , " says jeandet . " we regularly survey the objects , especially those that are potentially dangerous to shipping , depending on the importance of the object and the sea lane , maybe once a year or only once every 25 years . how unusual would a off the swedish coast be ? there 's an old wooden shipwreck that dates to the 15th or 16th century , the archeologists are n't sure . there 's a map on your website ? yes , but you wo n't find an object when you use that map because it 's not that precise . of course we have to inform the maritime community about obstructions that might hinder their traffic , but we do n't inform the public about objects that might be of historic interest - only people who can claim that they need to have the information . have you charted all of the objects in your sector by now , or do you still find new ones ?
