a grand rapids , michigan , says she was asked to leave a local mall on saturday for wearing what any woman might wear on a sweltering summer day . hannah pewee , a college student at grand state university , spent her saturday shopping at the woodland mall in grand rapids . " apparently some anonymous person reported me to mall security for inappropriate dress and i was kicked out , " she explains . " i am so angry right now i â€™ m shaking . i felt so embarrassed i almost cried . all because a stranger did n't like how i dressed . " she added , " never mind that within a one foot radius there were plenty of girls dressed just like me , since it 's ninety degrees outside . but apparently , how i was out having a fun time with my sister and next thing i know , i 'm out on the street . slut-shaming how girls are dressed is deplorable and outdated , and it needs to stop. . " the facebook post notes that the woman 's defense on facebook says it 's not going to show up in jeans and a sweater , sorry , and she was promptly kicked out of the shopping center .
