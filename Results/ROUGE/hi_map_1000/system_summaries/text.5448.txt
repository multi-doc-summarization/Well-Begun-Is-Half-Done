europe 's experimental mars probe hit the right spot of rocket fuel when it struck the surface at high speed , scientists say friday . pictures taken by nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter show a black spot in the area where the schiaparelli lander was meant to touch down wednesday , the european space agency said . the images end two days of speculation following the probe 's unexpected radio silence 50 seconds before the planned landing . schiaparelli is widely thought to have crashed and been destroyed . data transmitted from the probe before it lost contact indicated that its descent systems did not work properly . only nasa has repeatedly succeeded in landing several robotic vehicles on mars , including the opportunity and curiosity rovers . esa are that schiaparelli 's mother ship was successfully placed into orbit wednesday and will begin analyzing the martian atmosphere in search for evidence of life . still , the crash-landing is a painful reminder of how hard it is to put a spacecraft on the surface of the red planet . europe 's beagle 2 probe reached the surface in 2003 but failed to slow the robot to a hover just above the surface .
