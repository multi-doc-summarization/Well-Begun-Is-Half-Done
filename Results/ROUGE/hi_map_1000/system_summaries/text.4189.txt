the suicide bombers who blew themselves up at brussels airport was the suspected bomb-maker involved in november 's paris attacks , belgian officials announced on friday . the federal prosecutor confirmed that 24-year-old najim laachraoui was the bomber pictured on the left of a surveillance camera image captured before the twin blasts rocked with an explosive device at the bataclan de france . " he was a nice boy , and above all he was clever , that 's what i remember of him , " he said . " mourad and his whole family are crushed that najim could have committed such a barbaric act . " the family warned the police in 2013 when najim told them he was in syria , mourad said . the police visited them at the time and came back to search their home after the november 2015 paris attacks . mourad , a 25-year-old belgian , was one of tuesday 's suicide bombers , but friday was the first time his involvement in the attacks had been publicly acknowledged by officials . " we have n't heard from him since , " says a lawyer philippe culot . " it 's crazy , really - the same parents , the same upbringing , and one turns out really well and the other really bad . "
