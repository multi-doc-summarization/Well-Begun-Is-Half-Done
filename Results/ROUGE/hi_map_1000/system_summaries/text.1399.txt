the state of oklahoma and gas industry are likely to have triggered a sharp rise in earthquakes in the us state between 2008-13 . the scientists found that the disposal of water in four high-volume wells could be responsible for a swarm of tremors up to 35km away . their research has been published in the journal , science , reports the ap , which notes that the state averaged one such quake a year . the surge that wastewater injection , during which millions of barrels are forced into a disposal well , can induce earthquakes by increasing the fluid pressures underground . that is used not just for hydraulic fracturing , but also to squeeze more oil out of conventional wells . " the important thing is that we are seeing earthquakes that are much more widely distributed , much farther from wells and in a lot of different directions , " says the study 's lead author dr keranen from cornell university . " we 're seeing much higher ratios , in the hundreds , at the beginning of the well . " scientists say there has been increasing evidence of links between the process of oil and gas extraction and earthquakes in states like arkansas , texas , ohio and oklahoma in recent years . if a fault is close to failure , the amount that the pressure is going up at these locations in our model is enough to push them over the edge dr process . " it really is unprecedented to have this many earthquakes over a broad region like this
