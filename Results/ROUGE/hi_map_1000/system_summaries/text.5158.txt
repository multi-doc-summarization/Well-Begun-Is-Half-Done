a new report says the justice department regularly coerces defendants in federal drug cases to plead guilty by threatening them with steep prison sentences on average 11 years longer than those who plead guilty . in all , a whopping 97 percent of defendants plead guilty in 2012 , according to the report 's author , jamie fellner . " prosecutors can say , ‘ take these 10 years or , if you get a trial and are convicted , you ’ re going to look at life , " said fellner , per npr . " you don ’ t have the cost of a trial , it doesn ’ t take the time and resources , and it increases the notches on your belt of how many convictions you ’ s . " the report notes that prosecutors have a plea deal that would have sent her to prison for 17 years for dealing methamphetamines and having guns in her house . " if you can get someone to acknowledge guilt without the burden and expense of a deal , without having to marshal witnesses and line up witnesses , and without risking an acquittal , why not ? " he says .
