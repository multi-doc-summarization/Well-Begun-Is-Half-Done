a person is wrong in the primate world , and like us , they can tell when a person held a false belief about where it was mistaken about the location of an object , reports the bbc . researchers say they 've used a test developed for human babies , about 18 months of age , to determine if they could understand when the object to be , not realizing it had been moved . this was known as the " false-belief " portion of the study . for the first time that great apes can use an understanding of false beliefs to help others appropriately , " the first person watched the switch , so he knew where the object was and thus had a true belief . for some of the tests , the original person would step away , while another person took the object out of the box and put it into another box . " the study notes that the researchers found that he was mistaken in the room and could be dropped from the study because they failed to open the box where he had originally put the object . " whenever individuals interact , they need to understand the gestures , motivations , feelings , and beliefs of their partners. , " researchers say . " we already knew that they can understand someone else â€™ s goals , intentions and desires . "
