the military will continue to permit transgender individuals to serve openly until defense secretary jim mattis has received president donald trump 's " direction " to change the policy and figured out how to implement it , america 's top military officer said thursday . in a memo to all military service chiefs , commanders and enlisted military leaders , gen. joseph dunford , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said " there will be no modifications " to current policy for now , amid questions about trump 's announcement on twitter that the u.s. government will not " accept or allow " transgender people to serve in any capacity in the military . " i know there are questions about yesterday 's announcement , " dunford wrote . " as importantly , given the current fight and the challenges we face , we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions . " the dunford statement suggests that mattis was given no presidential direction on changing the transgender policy . mattis has been on vacation when trump made his announcement . the navy 's guidance , which came in an email from vice adm. robert burke , also acknowledges that trump 's tweets is " causing concern for some of our sailors and that they likely have questions .
