the americans went ahead on a move created by a trio of second-half substitutes . brek shea cut inside severo meza on the left flank and crossed to terrence boyd at the top of the 6-yard box . with his back to the goal , boyd took a touch with his left foot and with his right made a quick backheel pass to orozco fiscal , who plays in mexico for san luis . he entered in the 77th minute for his fifth international appearance and first since october . shea , back with the team for the first time since february following a season of turmoil in major league soccer , came on a minute later . boyd had entered to start the second half . " just happy we won and made history , " shea said . " it 's something we have n't done in a long time . just to be on the roster is cool . " howard preserved the lead , changing directions to stop a deflected shot by javier hernandez in the 85th . " i was sweating profusely coming into the game , but i just tried to focus on myself and do the things i know how to do well . "
