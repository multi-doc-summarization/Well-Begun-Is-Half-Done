espn commentator rob parker has been suspended indefinitely as a result of disparaging racial comments he made about washington redskins quarterback robert griffin iii on thursday , the ap reports . he generally acted as though he was the one who was owed an apology for anyone daring to question what he ’ s been that kind of a season , though he started at espn in 2003 . parker gained notoriety in 2008 when , while he was a detroit news columnist , he asked then-lions coach rod marinelli about his daughter being married to the team 's defensive coordinator . parker asked marinelli to tune in to friday ’ s first take for more discussion of the matter . that ’ s right out of the first take playbook : the show thrives on provoking controversy . " robert can certainly take care of himself . nonetheless , i hope that our men and for that matter , my own kids , will never beg for authenticity from someone who can only talk about the things that other people have the courage to do . people need to be held accountable for the offensive things that they say. , " he said . " i would just say some people put things out there about people so they can stir things up . "
