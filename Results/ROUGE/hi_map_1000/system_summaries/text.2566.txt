president trump blocked the release of hundreds of records on the assassination of president john f. kennedy , agreeing to appeals from the cia and fbi . now , trump has accepted a recommendation from the national archives to keep the lid closed , more than five decades after the 35th president was killed . trump writes in memo issued thursday that some of the classified documents are " of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure . " the fbi and cia had said the release could jeopardize national security . the records at issue are documents previously identified as assassination records , such as secret 1978 testimony from a former cia station chief in mexico city , david atlee phillips , a fort worth native . he called assassin lee harvey oswald " loony " and insisted that as far as he could tell , oswald had acted alone . " god knows i would like for it to come out that fidel castro was responsible or that the soviets were responsible , " phillips testified before the house select committee on assassinations , under questioning by rep. floyd fithian , an indiana democrat .
