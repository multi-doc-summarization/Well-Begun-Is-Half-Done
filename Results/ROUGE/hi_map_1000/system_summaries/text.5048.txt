the actress writes about the alleged incident in an excerpt from her upcoming memoir , 'this will only hurt a little , that james franco physically assaulted her on the set of their cult comedy freaks and geeks , where they played a tumultuous high school couple onscreen . the short-lived nbc sitcom , which aired for one season from 1999-2000 , was created by paul feig and executive produced by judd apatow . in her book , philipps remembers that the script called for her character , kim kelly , to gently hit franco in the chest while delivering a line . the next day , franco supposedly apologized after being ordered to do so by the episode 's director and producers . though he was asked to say he was sorry , philipps says that franco was never punished for his alleged behavior . when speaking to the hollywood reporter about her previous confrontation with franco on my back . wind knocked out of me . " james and i have talked about it over the years . at one point he apologized to me . i was always acutely aware of my expendability , and so i felt i needed to never complain , always show up on time and not be difficult . if someone else was being difficult , it was my job to be the easy one or figure out a way to soothe the situation .
