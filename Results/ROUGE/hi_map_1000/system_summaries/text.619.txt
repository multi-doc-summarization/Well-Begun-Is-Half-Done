the most important person in the english-language world is frank sinatra , according to an analysis of wikipedia articles led by university of tolouse researcher young-ho eom sought to figure out who , exactly , should be considered the most influential thinker in the world . " if i have seen further , it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants , " he so famously said . " we may all wield influence in our own domains , some people ( say , the ones who inspired newton ) are just more influential than others . in an intriguing new study , a team led to a more plausible conclusion : for instance , the more important that website is ; and being linked to from a national newspaper probably says more about a site 's importance over the years . using their approach , which studied how often academics referenced through wikipedia 's nearly endless treasures , you 'd end up on the most . the result was ... somewhat surprising . according to eom and co. , the world 's most influential mind was swedish naturalist carl linnaeus . linneaus beat the scientific system of naming that is still , generally , in use today . it 's under linnaeus ' system that human beings became homo sapiens , and taxonomical is not a reliable entrant on the list . the emergence of such pronounced accent to local figures seems to be natural since there are more links and interactions within one culture .
