george takei took to his facebook page thursday night to explain what he meant by calling supreme court justice clarence thomas a “ clown in blackface , ” saying the term was “ theater lingo ” that “ is not racist. ” a few fans have written wondering whether i intended to utter a racist remark by referring to justice thomas as a " clown in blackface. ” " blackface is a lesser known theatrical term for a white actor who blackens his face to play a black buffoon . in traditional theater lingo , and in my view and intent , that is not racist . it is instead part of a racist history in this country . i feel justice thomas has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings . he made a similar remark about the japanese american internment , of which i am a survivor . a sitting justice of the supreme court ought to know better . i have expressed my full thoughts on the matter here . a few thoughts from one of takei ’ s ( former ) fans . did anyone outside of the most hateful partisans really believe that he ’ s bad enough when conservatives of color get this from people of their own race , but now it ’ s apparently a racial elimination free-for-all . and what kind of screwed up person believes that someone abandons their entire race because of their politics anyways ?
