it 's not the first time the american military has sought to create a carrier in the sky . the defense advanced research products agency has a request out for ideas on how to develop an airborne platform that could release drones to spy on or attack an enemy and then return to the flying aircraft carrier . the pentagon 's research agency put out a request to industry this month to outline how a large cargo plane could both launch and recover other aircraft . " we want to find ways to make smaller aircraft more effective , and one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft , with minimal modification , to become 'aircraft carriers in the air , ' " dan patt , the manager for the darpa technologies program at the center for strategic and international studies . " if you think back to dirigibles , they used to have small aircraft , a one-man fighter , that would hook up to them . " in a conceptual submarine , the cia commissioned a pioneering drone manufactured in secret by lockheed martin , the d-21 , which was designed to launch from another jet and later from a b-52 bomber . the unmanned d-21 could carry a small squadron of sparrowhawk biplanes inside , and the planes would then launch from the dirigible after being lowered by a trapeze device . the biplane would return by latching onto a hook on the belly of the mothership . the us navy built two of the airships but both of them went down in disastrous crashes in the 1930s , killing dozens of crew and spelling the end of the experiment .
