diana carrillo , her sister and two friends decided to try the saint marc pub-cafe in pacific city last week , they were hoping for a nice shared experience . they got a shared experience , but not one they would have expected . " i already had my id out . i couldn ’ t say anything , " she tells the restaurant . " that ’ s one of the reasons i posted it on social media rather than just dealing with the imagination . " the waiter , which was the first such complaint the restaurant has had since it opened in 2015 , says he fired the waiter . " this type of behavior is not representative of the st. marc brand and will not be tolerated. , " he said , per the bbc . the restaurant was asked " in a joking fashion. , " and " can i see your proof of residency , " the director of operations tells him . the waiter asked the other three women the same thing , saying “ i need to make sure you ’ re residents before i serve you. ” he says she was n't buying it .
