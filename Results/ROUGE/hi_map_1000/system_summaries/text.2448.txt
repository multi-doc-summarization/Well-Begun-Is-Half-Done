south korean police found about 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late north korean dictator kim jong il strewn near the country 's main international airport on thursday , police officers said . police were analyzing security cameras to find how the 196 lapel pins ended up in a flowerbed of a hotel close to incheon international airport , just west of seoul , according to a local police officer who requested anonymity because he was n't authorized to speak to the media on the matter . " without the agreement and its buffers , we would almost have certainly seen several of the provocations , the provocative border skirmishes of the past six decades , spread like wildfire into larger battles , " he said , per the ap . pyongyang has carried out a series of missile tests in recent months and made repeated threats that it is ready to attack south korea and u.s. bases in the pacific while pursuing the capability to hit the american mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile . south korea accused pyongyang of floating propaganda leaflets down the han river earlier this week . the military discovered dozens of plastic bags , each carrying about 20 leaflets , near the river â€™ s estuary , close to the tense korean border last friday .
