more than two dozen plaintiffs have signed on to a massive lawsuit concerning an alleged scheme in which patients received non-fda approved screws during spine and back surgery . " the fraudulent non-fda conforming devices were installed in people ’ s bodies at a very low cost to the providers , " attorney brian kabateck said . " they were then fraudulently billing the insurance companies , the worker ’ s comp carriers , and making thousands and thousands of dollars off of each patient. . " officials say 28 new cases were filed at the los angeles county superior court on friday , making a total of 32 pending cases . derika moses , who said she has had 23 surgeries on her back since 2008 , is one of the plaintiffs . " this has been terrible , worst thing that ’ s ever happened to me…not knowing if the stuff still in me they couldn ’ t get out will one day kill me , " moses says . " all the people ' s lives you might have placed in danger . " moses said drobot has admitted to giving kickbacks to physicians , but said all of those surgeries were medically needed and authorized by insurance companies . right now the plaintiffs ’ attorneys say there may be thousands of other victims , and they want justice for those like moses .
