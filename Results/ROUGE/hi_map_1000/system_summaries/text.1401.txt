the company clarified to give its users more guidance about what types of posts are not allowed on the service . facebook walks a delicate line when it tries to ban violent or offensive content without suppressing the free sharing of information that it says it wants to encourage . its audience is vast , with a huge variance in age , cultural values and laws across the globe . " we ’ re trying to strike the balance based on the way our community works , " says facebook 's head of global policy management . " the landscape is complicated. ” the company hopes that more specific explanation of its rules will take some of the mystery out of what it will and will not allow . terrorist organizations like the islamic state have long been banned from the service , but supporting or praising groups involved in “ violent , criminal or hateful behavior . " it 's not clear whether it is illegal in that country , but may restrict access to content because it violates a law in a particular country , even though it doesn ’ t violate our community standards . and if a country requests that are designed to help people understand what is acceptable to treat each other with empathy and respect , so we are doing so with today 's update . there are also times when we may have to remove suicide or eating disorders . facebook has always banned pornography and most other nudity , or bullying them by posting items intended to degrade or shame them , is also prohibited .
