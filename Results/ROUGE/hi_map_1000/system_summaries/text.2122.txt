scientists have discovered the secret behind how these snakes stay airborne—they twist their bodies into an s shape that resembles an alien ’ s flying saucer from the side . scientists already knew that flying snakes climb up trees by using ridges on their belly scales to help grip bark as they slither upward , and that when the animals glide downward , to move from tree to tree without having to descend to the forest floor , and possibly even to hunt prey . " it looks like it 's swimming in the air , " socha told livescience . " you never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer ; you do n't find it in engineered flyers . we did n't know if that was a good shape to have . " the snake is unusual , saying , " how snakes can ‘ fly. ' " says the team , which notes that the snake would n't be nearly as aerodynamically effective at a plane 's size and speed , socha , and his colleagues used a video of a flying snake glider . ( the snake has been able to have the same flow characteristics . )
