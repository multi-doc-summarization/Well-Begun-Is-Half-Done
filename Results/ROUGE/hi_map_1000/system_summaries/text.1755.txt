the boston globe printed a satirical front page complete with fake stories that show how " troubling " its editorial board says a donald trump presidency would be for america . the newspaper 's front page is dated april 9 , 2017 , and its lead story is about trump calling for deportations . another article mentions work being halted on a wall at the mexico border . there 's also a short item about backlash trump received after tweeting a photo of his new dog he named " madame peng , " after china 's first lady peng liyuan . in an editorial ( http : //bit.ly/20qyqoh ) , the globe calls the satire " an exercise in taking a man at his word . " the board says republicans need to put up every roadblock to trump they can . the trump campaign has n't responded to requests for comment . house speaker ryan spoke to the possible long-term damage with which the party faces a double bind , a few conservatives have been clear-eyed enough to see the need for a plausible , honorable alternative that could emerge from the likely contested convention . names like paul ryan and mitt romney have come up . if trump were a politician running such a campaign in a foreign country right now , the us state department would probably be condemning him .
