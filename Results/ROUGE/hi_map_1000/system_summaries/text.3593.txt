the prostitution scandal that led 11 u.s. secret service agents to be returned home from cartagena , colombia , where they had been sent to provide protection for him , to be thorough and rigorous . during a news conference sunday at the conclusion of the summit of the americas , obama said he expects all agents to conduct themselves with “ dignity and probity ” and all u.s. personnel to “ observe the highest standards ” when serving abroad , the ap reports that the men brought a number of prostitutes back to a beachfront hotel near where obama was due to stay when he arrived the following day , a local police source says . at least one member of the security contingent flashed his badge and demanded that hotel staff allow him to remain with a woman , the source reports . " how shameful , " he said . " but it turned into more of a media sideshow , a ridiculous distraction , than a serious political meeting of presidents . " obama 's remarks were removed from cartagena on thursday and replaced with a new team shortly before obama 's arrival friday . " i never thought the summit agenda had much hope of being achieved , " former opposition presidential candidate carlos gaviria tells reuters . " there are many better things to show the world . "
