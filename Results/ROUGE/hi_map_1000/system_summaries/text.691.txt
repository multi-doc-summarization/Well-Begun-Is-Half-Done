four women have gone topless in st. peter 's square to protest the vatican 's plan to legalize gay marriage and let gay couples adopt children . french catholic bishops and other religious leaders have strongly opposed the proposal , and the pope appeared not to have been disturbed as he delivered his traditional prayer from his studio window overlooking the piazza . on their bare backs , the women had painted slogans " in gay we trust , " and " shut up . " one of them , inna shevchenko , said : " today we are here to protest against homophobia . " the small demonstration coincided with a march in paris that is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people protested against president francois hollande 's planned legalization of same-sex marriage . " but no one believes that these situations should be created just because in some cases they do n't cause damage , " he wrote . he reaffirmed the church 's view that no one has the " right " to children that he lived with his mother and her female partner . the court of cassation ruled it was " mere prejudice " to assume that living with a homosexual couple could be detrimental for a child 's development . while gay rights group arcigay called it a " historic ruling " for italy , where it is illegal for gay couples to adopt , catholic leaders were quick to defend the traditional family unit .
