president obama will pay a historic visit to cuba in the coming weeks , senior obama administration officials say wednesday , becoming the first president to set foot on the island in nearly seven decades . the brief visit in mid-march will mark a watershed moment for relations between the u.s. and cuba , a communist nation estranged from the u.s. for half a century until obama and cuban president raul castro moved to re-launch more than a year ago . since then , the nations have reopened embassies in washington and havana and moved to restore the lives of the cuban people . " 14 months ago , i announced that we would begin normalizing relations with cuba - and we 've already made significant progress , " he tweeted . " our flag flies over our embassy in havana once again . more americans are traveling to cuba than at any time in the last 50 years . " the president will be joined by the first lady on his trip to cuba , and the first family will join him in argentina . the move is planned for march 21-22 before the president flies to argentina on march 23-24 .
