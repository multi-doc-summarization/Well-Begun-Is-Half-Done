scientists have been investigating the link between human brain size and intelligence , with several studies suggesting inconclusively that the bigger the brain , the smarter a person . but a review of 88 studies involving more than 8,000 participants has now shown that even though a small link between brain volume and iq exists , there 's no evidence to suggest it 's a causal one . instead , it 's the structure of your brain that seems play a larger role in explaining iq test performance in humans . although a certain association is observable , brain volume appears to be more important as a biological foundation of iq , whilst brain size works as one of many compensatory mechanisms of cognitive functions . " this is n't the first nail in the coffin for the 'bigger brain = better ' argument , " says lead researcher jakob pietschnig , from the university of vienna in austria . " the first stumbling block was when scientists realised that humans - arguably the most intelligent animals on the planet - do n't actually have the biggest brains in the animal kingdom relative to body size .
