a nonprofit group says a children 's film about a rottweiler police dog who tries to infiltrate the world of dog shows is sending a " troubling message that grooms children for sexual abuse , " according to a statement made tuesday . " the dog is rewarded with advancing to the final round of the dog show after passing this barrier . disturbingly , these are similar tactics child abusers use when grooming children -- telling them to pretend they are somewhere else , and that they will get a reward for withstanding their discomfort , " hawkins said , per cnn . " children 's movies must be held to a higher standard , and must teach children bodily autonomy , the ability to say 'no ' and safety , not confusing messages endorsing unwanted genital touching . " " the movie stars ludacris as the voice of max the rottweiler and will arnett as his human partner . they are undercover officers who must crack the case of a kidnapped panda by infiltrating a prestigious dog show . one of the writers for the movie , max botkin , applauded the choice to re-cut the movie and made clear that he did not write any of the deleted scenes . i 'm happy and proud to say that show dogs is being recut based on audience concerns and in theaters this weekend in a family-safe version . i did n't write the scenes in question , only the original script which was heavily rewritten .
