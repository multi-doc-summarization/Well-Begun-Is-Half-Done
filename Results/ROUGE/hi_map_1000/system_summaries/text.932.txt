new california lawyers will have to swear to be courteous and dignified under a change in the legal oath approved by the california supreme court , it was announced thursday . as of may 23 , the oath required of lawyers admitted to the california bar will include a so-called civility pledge . the court adopted it at the urging of the american board of trial advocates , which has pushed for the new language based on his observation , after 45 years of practice , that too many lawyers aren ’ t treating each other as well as they used to . more than in the past , kelly said , lawyers shout and swear at one another , make personal attacks in court filings , reject their adversaries ’ routine requests to extend deadlines , and even try to intimidate judges . maybe some of that behavior would change , he said , if newly enrolled attorneys took a pledge of civility . but both kelly and a spokesman for the state ’ s high court said the civility oath was a general admonition that would not be a basis for discipline . " as an officer of the court , i will strive discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of my knowledge and ability. , " he said .
