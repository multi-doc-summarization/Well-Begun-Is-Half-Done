" step forward , ’ and they all step back , " he said . " the timing is not right for me , but i am hopeful that the people of massachusetts will select someone of great integrity , vision , and compassion as our next us senator , " the boston herald reports . " it reminds me of the three stooges episode where the sergeant says i have been humbled by the outreach i received this weekend encouraging me to become a candidate for the us senate . " romney , who was taking a more aggressive role in running the campaign , was a visible surrogate for kerry 's seat , after former republican sen. scott brown 's decision to pass on a campaign left republicans scrambling for an alternative . tagg patrick , is filling kerry ’ s senate seat until a special election decides his long-term replacement in june .
