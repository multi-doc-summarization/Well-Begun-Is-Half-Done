sen. john mccain announced friday in a statement that he can not " in good conscience vote for the graham-cassidy proposal , " the arizona republican said . " i believe we could do better working together , republicans and democrats , and have not yet really tried . nor could i support it without knowing how much it will cost , how it will ( affect ) insurance premiums , and how many people will be helped or hurt by it . without a full cbo score , which wo n't be available by the end of the month , we wo n't have reliable answers to any of those questions . " mccain 's " no " vote means it is likely republicans wo n't want able to repeal and replace obamacare before september 30 , as sen. rand paul of kentucky said he would not back graham-cassidy and sen. susan collins of maine has said she is leaning " to change his mind even if changes are made to the bill , his spokesman sergio gor told cnn . graham and mccain 's close friendship mccain 's announcement comes despite that one of the bill 's key sponsors ' s effect on premiums and the number of people covered . in the poll , 68 percent of voters said they would be less likely to vote for a member of congress if he or she voted for graham-cassidy , while 23 percent would be more likely .
