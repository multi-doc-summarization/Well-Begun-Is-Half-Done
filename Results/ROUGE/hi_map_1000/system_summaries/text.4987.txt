the first true bid for the assets of troubled the weinstein company will be a difficult one to beat for any bidders thinking of getting into the fray . it starts with the woman fronting the bid , a mexican immigrant who served in the obama cabinet and has built banks and businesses and has four bona fide backers , some in silicon valley , ready to pony up $ 275 million in funds that are at the ready and will not have to be raised . those funds would take twc â€™ s long-suffering investors out of the equation , and far exceeds the $ 150 million- $ 175 million that colony capital offered in a bottom-feeding bid that was fed to the press as cataclysmic when the board rejected it . " i was really disoriented . my english was very bad . all of the words in that agreement were super difficult to understand . i guess even now i needed to support my mom and brother and how my life was being destroyed , and i did it , " she told me . " the moment i did n't even understand almost what i was doing with all those papers . "
