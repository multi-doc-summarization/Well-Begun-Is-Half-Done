scientists say they have made a huge step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms of human intelligence , but scientists say that intelligence may be influenced by two networks of genes , possibly controlled by a master regulatory system british scientists who had taken iq tests , and from people with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability . " the idea of ultimately using drugs to affect cognitive performance is not in any way new . we all drink coffee to improve our cognitive performance , " he said . " it ’ s exciting about this is that the genes we have found are likely to share a common regulation , which means that potentially we can manipulate a whole set of genes whose activity is linked to human intelligence . " scientists say the genes will also be invited to attend a new clinic visit in aberdeen or edinburgh , which can be used in the quest for diagnostic tests and new therapies . " traits such as intelligence are governed by large groups of genes working together , especially disease so one day we could help people with learning disabilities fulfil their potential , " says johnson said , per the washington post . " we found that genetics plays a major role in intelligence but until now haven ’ t known which genes are relevant . this research highlights some of the genes involved in human intelligence and how they interact with each other .
