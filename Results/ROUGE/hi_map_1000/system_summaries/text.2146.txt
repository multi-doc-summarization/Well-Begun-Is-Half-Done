twenty-five years after the famed art heist at boston 's isabella stewart gardner museum , law enforcement officials released new surveillance video thursday showing an unauthorized visitor entering the museum the night before the theft . that person entered the museum through the same door as the thieves in the middle of the night , but three officials familiar with the investigation confirmed to the globe that it is he . officials released the video to solicit the public â€™ s help in identifying the second man , hoping to make some movement in the largest unsolved art theft in the world . " over many months we have engaged in an exhaustive re-examination of the original evidence in this case . our aim has been to ensure that all avenues have been explored in the continuing quest to recover these artworks , " said united states attorney carmen ortiz . the man spent about three minutes in the reception area and appears to fumble access to a man who can be seen in the museum 's reception area at about 12:49 a.m. on march 17 , 1990 , nearly exactly 24 hours before the heist . the car matches the general description of a vehicle that was reported to have been parked outside the museum moments prior to the theft on march 18 , 1990 .
