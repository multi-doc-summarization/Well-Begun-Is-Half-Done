" the design process was about optimization , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program , tells fast company . " we 're trying to make the jet relevant for the future . there 's an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology . " qatar airways is hoping that the plane could be just as technologically sound today as at the end of its projected 30-year lifespan , which is made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic , reducing the weight of the aircraft and of course the amount of fuel required for long-haul flights . larger and wider wings , together with flaps that follow the flight path direction rather than the wind , combine to create a 25 percent improvement in the plane 's fuel economy over comparable models currently in the sky , according to airbus . in terms of passenger comfort , the economy seats are a little further apart , and it 's easier to get down the aisles . the interior design of the cabin can be adapted by individual airlines , depending on how they want to make use of the space ( and how many business class passengers they 're expecting . )
