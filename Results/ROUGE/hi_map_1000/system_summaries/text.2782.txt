it 's not clear that christmas traditions , but the new york times reports that the massachusetts bay colony 's general court shed some light on just how the puritans managed to shutter holiday celebrations . " christians are coming to retake their place in the public square , and the most natural battleground in this war is christmas , " he writes . " it is therefore ordered by this court and the authority thereof that whosoever shall be found observing any such day as christmas or the like , either by forbearing of labor , feasting working on christmas as mandatory and dispatched town criers on christmas eve to shout their good health . if denied no biblical authority for celebrating jesus ' birth on dec. 25 , the theocrats who ran massachusetts regarded the holiday as a mere human invention , a remnant of a heathen past . they also disapproved of the rowdy celebrations about the public celebration of christmas have been lodged from within the christian traditionâ€”by devout christians who had little use for the holiday . for a surprising number of american believers , the chief concern was n't putting christ back into christmas . it was taking christmas out of christianity .
