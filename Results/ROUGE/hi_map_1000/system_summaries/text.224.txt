if journalists played it straight with movie stars , they ’ d call it an interrogation not an interview . it 's a new project or two , ignoring the pitiful pleas for a phone call , a lawyer , a mommy , the journalist would shine a light in those pretty , pretty eyes , and start grilling . what did you have to do to get your big break ? how long do you think you can turn the trick , keep the public interested , huh ? and it ’ s easy to forget that our interests are at odds and that the relationship is , at heart , antagonistic and full of the hot stink of fear and funk . after bouncing the star off a wall or two " the journalist revelation , a couple of juicy details with which to titillate readers . use and be used , give and take , a mutual hustle and the way of the world . mind you , i ’ m not proposing that kate herself is antagonistic . she isn ’ t . in fact , her niceness is as pronounced , extreme , and undeniable as her talent—it ’ s the quality of hers you ’ re struck by first . photograph by annie leibovitz ; styled by jessica diehl . but i 'm getting ahead of myself . cat class , cat style let movie stars and the journalists who cover them are edgy , deeply . they are , by their very nature , transactional .
