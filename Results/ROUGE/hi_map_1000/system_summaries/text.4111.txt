donald trump 's fierce denunciation of hillary clinton on wednesday was rife with distortion . he accused clinton of announcing a withdrawal from iraq that was n't on her watch , pulled numbers out of nowhere on her plan for refugees and went beyond the established facts behind the killing of the us ambassador to libya in stating starkly that she " left him there to die . " in doing so , he assigned her far more influence in the world than she exercised as secretary of state . a look at some of his assertions and how they stack up with the facts : trump : " in just four years , secretary clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire middle east . " his endorsement was released hours after the republican presumptive nominee donald trump launched a broad attack on clinton 's experience , honesty and foreign policy experience in a 40-minute speech . scowcroft directly rebutted trump 's claim that clinton does not have the temperament to lead , citing her experience working on high-pressure issues such as iran and israel . " she brings deep expertise in international affairs and a sophisticated understanding of the world , which i believe are essential for the commander-in-chief , " scowcroft said . his backing follows that of another prominent republican in national security circles . richard armitage , who served in the state and defense departments under george w. bush and president ronald reagan , announced last week that he will vote for clinton over trump .
