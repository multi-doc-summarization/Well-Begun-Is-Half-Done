" if they want to get these out of the water , they should be contracting with the tribal or commercial fisherman . saying , 'go out and catch all you can ' is irresponsible . it 's not controlled , and there 's no way to know the impact on other species . if you 're seriously going to remove these , you contract with commercial fishermen and remove these .
