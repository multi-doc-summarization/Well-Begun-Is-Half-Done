michelle obama cajoled jay leno into nibbling on apples , sweet potato fries and a pizza made with eggplant , green peppers and zucchini on the " tonight show , " breaking his long-held aversion for all-things-healthy in his diet . leno once told a magazine he had n't eaten a vegetable since 1969 , and he insisted he tasted his last apple in 1984 . that did n't dissuade the first lady , who 's promoting her " let 's move ! " campaign to get kids excited about fitness and healthy eating habits . earlier , obama poked at him in the white house garden : " it will help it go down easier , " she said . " you know , there 's really no way to mentally prepare for it . you take each day as it comes . " she added , " that is right , regardless of political affiliation . " " it 's ... a beautiful song , " leno tells her . " i think barack and i , our motto is , we try to do the best job that we can do every single day . and the hope is that that will speak for itself . "
