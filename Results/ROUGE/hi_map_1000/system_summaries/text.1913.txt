texas christian university in fort worth , texas april 8 , 2015 58 years ago when i was a student , it was the end of my sophomore year here at tcu , i got my first paid job in journalism . a full time job . " because that was where it all started for me , i wanted you all to be the first to know that this summer i 'm going to retire , " he said . " you know , i 'm one of the luckiest people in the world because as a little boy , as a young reporter , i always wanted to be a journalist , and i got to do that ! and not many people get to do . and i could n't have asked for a better life or something that was more fun and more fulfilling . that little job at kxol - which by the way paid $ 1 an hour . they had the strangest overtime system i 've ever heard of . i 've never heard of anything since like it . the first hour of overtime was 90 cents . the third hour . we always used to say that if you worked 11 hours , you had to pay them a dime ! but this is true ! i 'm sitting here .
