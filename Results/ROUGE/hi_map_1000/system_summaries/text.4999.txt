a clever name that harry potter fans will appreciate the social media behemoth to map where users were when they sent messages . the app also showed the locations , which were accurate to within three feet , in a group chat with people he barely knew , reports the new york daily news . " i quickly found that it was the easiest way to keep in touch with old high school friends , contact people i had just met , organize impromptu games with people i hardly knew , and everything in between . however , i did n't realize how much data about me messenger was revealing to the people i chatted with until last week when i began tinkering with my message history . as you may not believe that there are enough of these location tagged messages to provide truly invasive data on any one person , since they must be on mobile , with gps on , and choose to share their location for it to be sentâ€¦ right ? what you should keep in mind is that the mobile app for facebook messenger defaults to sending a location with all messages . you can get this extension here and play around with it on your message data . a screenshot of the map the extension creates : what i realized was that almost every other message in my chats had a location attached to it , so i decided to have some fun with this data . i wrote a browser application that requires a facebook user to log into their facebook account and then displays on a map the geo-location data shared with that user through facebook messenger chats .
