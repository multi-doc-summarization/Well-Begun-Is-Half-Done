jades parents were in a horrible head on collison in the park by a person who fell asleep at the wheel . david suffered multiple injuries and had to be flown out of yellowstone from the crash site for treatment for his numerous injuries at the time of the accident , reports the los angeles times . " we all want jade to be found and returned to her family that is missing her so much . they have shown over and over again how much they love her by the trips back and forth to the park and sending clothes with their smell on them and even now they are going to leave a car in the area in hopes jade will go to it . so many efforts are on going to catch this pup ... .we need help to bring jade home . if you can help with any small donation to the family of jade it will be so much appreciated . every little bit helps to get jade back home ... safe ! thank you for any consideration in helping the many who love jade now as our own ... she is a young , strong dog and has been able to survive somehow against all odds . there are efforts going on daily trying to catch jade in live traps and many other methods that are allowed by the park . so far to no avail , but no one is giving up hope . you can only imagine the expense this is causing the family to take on as well as the mounting medical bills .
