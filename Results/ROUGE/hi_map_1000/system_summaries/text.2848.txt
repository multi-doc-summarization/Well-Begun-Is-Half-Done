the world 's largest shrimp exporter exporter suppliers are engaged in abusive labor practices , reports the bbc . the report conducted by verite on behalf of geneva-based nestle and released monday found " indicators of forced labor , trafficking , and child labor to be present among sea-based and land-based , " per the company , which notes that workers were lured to hazardous and physical abuse , and were sold to boat captains needing crews for their ships . " virtually all companies sourcing seafood in the thai seafood sector are exposed to the same risks , " he said . " we will also be able to evaluate the sustainability of seafood sources ( wild and farmed ) and identify projects to enhance our supply chain against our category-specific requirements for fish and seafood â€“ for example , that there is no known sourcing from operations that are not legally licensed for production and sales . " the report notes that the lawsuit also wanted costco to stop buying shrimp from its thailand suppliers , and the plan includes setting up channels through which workers can air grievances , training for boat captains and owners , and establishing better methods of tracing raw materials and verifying labor standards . some are charged excessive fees , leaving them stuck in debt , in order to get jobs where they catch and process fish that ends up in nestle .
