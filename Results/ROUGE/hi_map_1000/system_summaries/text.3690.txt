isis has executed nearly 2,000 people in syria during the past six months , the majority of them civilians , a british-based syrian monitoring organization said on sunday . islamic state also killed 120 of its own members , most of them foreign fighters trying to return home , in the last two months , according to the syrian observatory for human rights . the dead included 930 members of the shaitat tribe which rose up against isis in the eastern province of deir ezzor in the summer , the uk-based observatory said . on dec. 17 , the observatory said a mass grave containing the bodies of 230 shaitat had been found in the province . the monitoring group , which relies on a network of activist and medical sources on the ground in syria , said the victims were shot dead , beheaded or stoned to death in the provinces of aleppo , deir ezzor , hama , hasakeh and raqqa . women , children included of those killed , 1,175 were civilians who included four children and eight women . they were arrested during clashes between is and the regime forces . we in sohr believe that the real number of people that had been killed by is is higher than the number documented by isis to be far higher , given that many have disappeared and remain unaccounted for . isis often records such killings on video and posts footage on the internet , which experts say is meant to sow fear among civilians and rival groups , as well as to attract new recruits .
