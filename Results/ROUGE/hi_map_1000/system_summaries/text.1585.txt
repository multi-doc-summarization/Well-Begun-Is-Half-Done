former civic activist rachel dolezal went from claiming she is actually part of a white family in an interview aired on tuesday night with nbc news host savannah guthrie .

" so , what ’ s the word for it ? the closest thing that i can come to is , if you ’ re not , ” dolezal said . “ i ’ m more black than i am . ” she said she was " born in a teepee. , " and she says she was n't altered her skin . " some days i might spray on bronzer , if i want to get a glow , " he says . " but i don ’ t had a dna test . there ’ s been no biological proof that larry and ruthanne are my biological parents .
