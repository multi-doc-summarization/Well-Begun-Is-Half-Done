mahmoud ahmadinejad has been accused of using supernatural powers to further his policies amid an increasingly bitter power struggle between him and the country 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei . several people said to be close to the president and his chief of staff , esfandiar rahim mashaei , as " a man with special skills in metaphysics and connections with the unknown worlds , " reports the bbc . ahmadinejad 's unprecedented disobedience prompted harsh criticism from conservatives who warned that he might face the fate of abdulhassan banisadr , iran 's first post-revolution president who was impeached and exiled for allegedly attempting to undermine clerical power . ayatollah mesbah yazdi , a hardline cleric close to khamenei , warned that disobeying the supreme leader – who has the ultimate power in iran , is equivalent to " apostasy from god , " per the new york times . " the history of u.s.-iranian relations is littered with corpses of failed contacts , where the u.s. was talking with a single faction or an intermediary who couldn ’ t deliver , " he said . " he [ ahmadinejad ] craves recognition from outside , and mashaei is his instrument . "
