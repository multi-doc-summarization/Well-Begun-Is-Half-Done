los angeles city prosecutors will ask a judge to send lindsay lohan back to jail after she violated the terms of her probation . lohan was kicked out of a program at the downtown women 's center , where she was transferred to the american red cross for those community service hours . " we will be seeking jail time , " frank mateljan tells the daily news . " if i travel , its for work and its been approved . as is anything i do when i leave the state . i 'd appreciate it if people will just let me do what is asked of me , so that i can get my life back . please ignore the reports which have no truth to them . thank you . " lohan 's publicist would n't discuss the wednesday hearing but said lilo completed her court-ordered shoplifting course , switched her community service at the red cross pretty much every day last week , and she 's subsequently been terminated . " i think the judge will give her another stern warning , but i would n't be surprised if she followed the strict letter of her ruling and put lindsay in jail , " he said .
