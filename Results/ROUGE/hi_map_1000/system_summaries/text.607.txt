a family who donated their wedding 40 days before she was set to walk down the aisle , the bbc reports . " we went home that evening and my husband woke up the next morning and i was in the process of canceling the venue , letting them know that we had no use for it , and he said , ‘ no , we ’ re going to call , " fowler said . " it 's a very creme de la creme wedding venue , so to say that you 're going to host 200 homeless individuals at villa christina -- it sounds like a prank call . " fowler and carol fowler have planned an elaborate , sophisticated wedding reception for their daughter , tamara women with children , for a full sit-down meal at a swanky local restaurant . " my husband actually prayed about it , " carol fowler told abcnews.com today . " i should say so . i mean , going to the reception that was going to be for her , and now it 's for 200 strangers . fowler : yes , and she was also very delighted to see and know that others had an opportunity to enjoy something rather than just allow it to go to waste .
