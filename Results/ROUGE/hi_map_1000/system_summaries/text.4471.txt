nearly a million jars of peanut butter are being dumped at a new mexico landfill to expedite the sale of a bankrupt peanut-processing plant that was at the heart of a 2012 salmonella outbreak and nationwide recall . bankruptcy trustee clarke coll said he had no other choice after costco wholesale refused to take shipment of the sunland inc. product and declined requests to let it be donated to brokers who provide food to institutions like prisons . " we considered all options , " coll said . " they did n't agree . " costco officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment . but court filings indicate the product was made with $ 2.8 million worth of valencia peanuts owned by costco and had been sitting in the warehouse since the company shut down and filed for bankruptcy last fall . after extensive testing , costco agreed to a court order authorizing the trustee to sell it the peanut butter . " the farmers , the people who are owed money by this bankrupt company are going to benefit because of this , " he said , per the ap . but the company 's lawyers argued in a monday hearing that the judge should honor thursday â€™ s auction results and that anything less would create uncertainty and deter bidding in future bankruptcy cases .
