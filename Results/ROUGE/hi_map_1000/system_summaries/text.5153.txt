the ceo of the company that sells the device is promising to deliver a real smartphone for just rs , reports the bbc . " we are ready with nearly two lakh ‘ freedom 251 ’ handsets . we will start delivery from june 30 , " he said . " now we have a 4-inch , but i am happy that the dream of connecting rural and poor indians as part of the ‘ digital india ’ and ‘ make in india ’ initiatives has been fulfilled with ‘ freedom . i feel vindicated . " the company has been able to keep its promise to consumers , but it 's not clear why the company needs another registration round , given the massive number of registrations for the freedom 251 after it ships the first 200,000 units . the company is also planning to launch a fraction of what it promised to buy the cheapest of the day . " these will be the cheapest television sets in india and will be available for less than rs 10,000 . within two days , the delivery is here , hopes that it would reduce its losses once it ramps up shipments .
