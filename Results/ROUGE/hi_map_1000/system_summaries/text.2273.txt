the supreme court on tuesday upheld a government rule that will parcel out the duty to stop or at least reduce dirty air from blowing from one state into another . the decision split the court , mainly along the lines of whether big government is getting out of control . it took nearly a half-hour for the authors of the majority and dissenting opinions to orally proclaim in the courtroom their differences , in the six-to-two ruling in environmental protection agency v. eme homer city generation . it was a clear victory for epa , with the only blemish on its name the complaint of the dissenters : “ the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth. ” " some pollutants stay within upwind states ’ borders , the wind carries others to downwind , and some subset of that group drifts to states without air quality problems , " gina mccarthy , the e.p.a . administrator , said in a statement , " in crafting a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution , regulators [ the epa ] must account for the vagaries of the wind .
