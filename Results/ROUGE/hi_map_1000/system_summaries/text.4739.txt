sears ' biggest shareholder appears to be pushing for a breakup of the 125-year-old company that has asked the struggling retailer to sell its prominent kenmore appliance brand and its home improvement business , the company said monday . the private equity firm esl investments said it might buy the assets if the company is willing to sell . that sent shares of sears holding corp. , which have lost more than 70 percent of their value in the past year , up nearly 5 percent . lampert , who combined sears and kmart in 2005 after helping bring kmart out of bankruptcy , has long pledged to turn the company 's fortunes around . he said the retailer would find ways to capitalize on its best-known brands like kenmore appliances and diehard car batteries , as well as its vast holdings of land . " we understand that sears has marketed certain of these assets for nearly two years but , with the exception of the craftsman divestiture , has been unable to reach agreement with potential purchasers on acceptable terms , " lampert wrote in the letter , which sears posted on its website on monday .
