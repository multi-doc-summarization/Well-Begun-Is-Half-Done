a florida state appeals court overturned the murder conviction of corrupt fbi agent john j. connolly jr. on wednesday , ruling that jurors relied on a flawed charge against him in the 1982 killing of a boston businessman . the decision raises the possibility that the 73-year-old connolly , james “ whitey 's longtime handler and a central figure in one of the most notorious chapters in boston ’ s criminal history , could be freed . by a 2-to-1 decision , the miami appeals court ruled that connolly ’ s conviction of second-degree murder with a firearm in 2008 should be overturned because , among other reasons , he did not carry or discharge the gun that was used to kill john callahan in south florida . " the lawyer for the former handler of notorious southie mobster james paul ii were apparently answered yesterday when two florida judges ruled the disgraced fbi agent ’ s second-degree murder rap should be tossed . " in fact , i told john right after he was sentenced not to worry because we had already won the case , " he said . " it ’ s interesting that he has a chance to be free and to be back with his family . unfortunately , my husband doesn ’ t have that chance , and i guess we ’ ll do what we can to keep him . "
