a cnn anchor became the target of rebuke for assuming that the 2017 national spelling champion , a california resident who 's of south asian descent , is " used to using " sanskrit , reports cnn . " it ’ s a nonsense word . so , we ’ re not sure that its root is actually in sanskrit , which is what you are used to , " cnn anchor alisyn camerota tells cnn . if she 's guilty of anything it 's recycling a joke , " she knows which part of the world sanskrit is from . the issue is not what camerota intended . the problem is not that she jokes that the origins of covfefe might be sanskrit . " cnn notes that she was n't the first time the anchor joked about sanskrit being the origin of the interview , which was a " nonsense word " anyway . " alisyn made the same joking reference to the root of 'covfefe ' in an earlier panel discussion that aired wednesday , " he said . " we do not always have to be so sensitive and thin-skinned and bristle about racism at the drop of a hat or a recycled joke . and let 's give her some credit . "
