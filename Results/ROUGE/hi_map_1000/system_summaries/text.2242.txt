" you know i never lie . " the hospital notes that duke 's last stay in the hospital scared his family and even scared him a little . pilar , his estranged wife third wife , wanted a reconciliation , and one night , while he was recuperating , he started hacking so violently that his stitches burst . that alone might have killed him . but he snapped back . at the hospital , duke apologized for the phony press releases from his producers said that john wayne was in good samaritan hospital in los angeles for treatment of an old leg injury resulting from a fall on his yacht . he had been having respiratory trouble ever since losing a lung to cancer in 1964 .
