restaurant marc forgione in tribeca has been kicked out of a restaurant on saturday night , but it 's not clear whether it 's a variety of jobs . " i ’ m not sorry i spoke up , ” ron lieber 's journal tells the new york times . “ i don ’ t remember exactly what i said , though i did not raise my voice to the point beyond where people in the kitchen could hear it . i could only guess that eating was intimate enough , it prompted people to engage in this type of boorish behavior . maybe 20 seconds after i had returned to my seat , he approached the table . he apologized , barely , and then let me know that he thought it was incredibly rude of me to come into his kitchen and tell him how to do his job . i repeated the fact that he had been ruining my dinner . but his yelling was all in the interest of maintaining quality , he said . " it ’ s a good restaurant , with a great cocktail and a clever bread operation . but that ’ s as far as i got into the meal . about ten minutes after my party of four sat down , we heard yelling ' coming from the kitchen . mr. forgione was dressing down a member of the staff ’ s harsh words delivered our amuse-bouche , and the poor guy was so rattled he could barely speak above a mumble . a few minutes later , the same idiot who asks one too many questions about obscure ingredients on the menu to show off to his obviously bored-to-death date .
