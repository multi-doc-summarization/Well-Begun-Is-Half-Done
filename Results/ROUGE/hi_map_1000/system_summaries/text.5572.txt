two lawsuits filed in federal court thursday aim to shut down colorado 's regulated marijuana industry , claiming that the state 's recreational marijuana laws are in violation of federal law . the suits , filed by the anti-drug group safe streets and three other plaintiffs , target a number of colorado lawmakers , including gov . john hickenlooper , who has argued a marijuana case before the u.s. supreme court . " if safe streets came to colorado , they would see that their arguments about economic and moral decay hold no water , " he said . " it is suffering injuries to its business and property caused by the operations of summit marijuana , a state-licensed recreational marijuana store that plans to open less than 75 yards from the front entrance of new vision â€™ s hotel . " colorado state rep. jonathan singer says the plaintiffs are seeking damages due to alleged injury brought on by legalization . " this lawsuit is a bad idea and represents what is hopefully a last vestige of the wasteful war on drugs , " georgetown law professor randy barnett tells the huffington post . " we ca n't blame the victory or failures in our state solely on marijuana . "
