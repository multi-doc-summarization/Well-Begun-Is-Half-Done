participants typically report substantive changes to their personality when they become intoxicated , but observations from outsiders suggest less drastic differences between " sober " and " drunk " personalities . " we were surprised to find such a discrepancy between drinkers ' perceptions of their own alcohol-induced personalities and how observers perceived them , " says psychological scientist rachel winograd of the university of missouri , st. louis . " participants reported experiencing differences in all factors of the five factor model of personality , but extraversion was the only factor robustly perceived to be different across participants in alcohol and sober conditions . " in winograd 's previous studies , participants reliably reported that their personality changes when they imbibe , but experimental evidence for this kind of global change was lacking . later , the participants came to the lab in friend groups of 3 or 4 , where the researchers administered a baseline breathalyzer test and measured the participants ' height and weight . over the course of about 15 minutes , each participant consumed beverages , some drank sprite , while others consumed individually-tailored vodka and sprite cocktails designed to produce a blood alcohol content of about .09 .
