" people just thought it was crazy , " he said . " i 'm certainly greatly honored to be associated . " nasa 's plan to send a spacecraft into the sun ’ s outer atmosphere has a new name , which is being developed by johns hopkins applied physics laboratory , is supposed to launch on top of a delta iv heavy rocket in either july or august of 2018 , reports the washington post . the probe will have be known as the parker solar <unk> , which will be adversely in this manner while still alive , that flows from the sun out into space . parker , a professor emeritus at the university of chicago who will turn 90 on 10 june , put forward his theory in 1958 . it 's not a journey that any human can make , so nasa is sending a roughly 10-foot-high probe on the historic mission that will put it closer to the sun than any spacecraft has ever reached before .
