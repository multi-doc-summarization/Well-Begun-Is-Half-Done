the mars warship was carrying hundreds of soldiers when it exploded in the baltic sea in 1564 during the northern seven years , reports the bbc . the ship , known as mars , belonged to the swedish navy and was one of northern europe 's largest and most feared naval vessels used in the shoulder by a javelin thrown from one of the fighting tops of the enemy ships . " this year , we have come closer to the people aboard . we found more skeletal parts , including a femur with trauma around the knee which we believe to stem from a sharp-edged weapon , " says maritime archaeologist rolf fabricius warming . " we can see from the wreckage that it was a very intense and tough battle . between 800 and 1,000 men were on board . that is comparable to the population of an entire medium-sized town at the time . but when we study the wreckage itself we see a large congruency between the wreck site and the historical sources . it 's totally unique . together with other exciting finds , it can shed new light on medieval and early modern naval warfare .
