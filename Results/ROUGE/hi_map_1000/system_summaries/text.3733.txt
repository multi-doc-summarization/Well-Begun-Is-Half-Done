the average woman with a year-round full-time job can expect to make just 79 percent of what a man doing the same makes in a year . there are many factors that go into the disparity , but even women who make it to the top don ’ t make as much as men , new data shows . the average female worker makes the most money she ’ ll ever earn a full 25 years before she 's likely to retire . between the ages of 20 and 40 , the median pay for women ticks up slightly every five years until topping off at $ 49,000 , where it stays through age 65 , according to data released by salary comparison site payscale on thursday . but men see their salaries grow all the way until they ’ re at least 50 , when their median earnings hit $ 75,000 . but the reason for the divergence at middle age isn ’ t simply the “ obvious explanation ” that women take time off from work to have kids and return lacking the necessary skills to move up . women make between 1.3 percent less than men in the real estate industry and 5.4 percent less in mining , quarrying , and oil and gas .
