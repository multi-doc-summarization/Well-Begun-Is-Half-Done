a federal judge in virginia has sided with a transgender teen who claims a school board 's bathroom policies discriminated against him . the judge in norfolk ordered lawyers for the school board and former student gavin grimm to schedule a settlement conference . grimm sued in 2015 , claiming the policy violated his constitutional rights as well as federal protections against sex discrimination . he took the case to an appeals court before it was sent back to a lower court last year . grimm 's lawyers at the american civil liberties union argued that title ix -- a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs -- includes discrimination based on gender identity . " after full consideration of the facts presented and the compelling scope of relevant legal analyses , the court concludes that mr. grimm has sufficiently pled a title ix claim of sex discrimination under a gender stereotyping theory , " wrote judge arenda l. wright allen , of the us district court for the eastern district of virginia . a federal appeals court based in chicago issued a similar ruling in a different challenge in may 2017 .
