belgian officials are investigating whether doctors improperly euthanized a woman with autism , the first criminal investigation in a euthanasia case since the practice was legalized in 2002 . the 38-year-old had been diagnosed with asperger 's syndrome , a mild form of autism , two months before she died in an apparently legal killing by a doctor . belgium and the netherlands became the first countries in the world to legalise so-called mercy killing , but it can only be carried out by doctors and under very strict conditions . the decision in belgium , taken on thursday by the court of appeal in ghent , stems from a civil action brought by a sister of an autistic woman , tine nys , who was euthanised in 2010 at the age of 38 . the sister accused the doctors of not having properly prepared the case and of taking a rushed decision when the woman had not been treated for mental issues for years . the idea is that those with a psychiatric illness should be afforded the same rights as those suffering from a physical one . " i always regret that we couldn ’ t do something else , " said dr. lieve thienpont , one of the doctors who signed off on geerts ’ death . " there have already been legal cases involving doctors , but they have always resulted in dismissals before going to court . "
