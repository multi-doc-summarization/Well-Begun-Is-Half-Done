archaeologists uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western north america . the find was announced thursday by the u.s. bureau of land management , which controls the land on which the site was found . university of oregon archaeologist patrick o'grady , who supervises the dig , says the rimrock draw rockshelter outside riley has not been fully excavated . " no one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer , that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up , " he said . " until then , extreme skepticism is all they are going to get . " two pre-clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists , grayson said . one is paisley verde in chile . both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest clovis sites . if the date of rimrock holds up , it would be the oldest west of the rockies , and another predating the so-called clovis culture , once generally believed to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication , but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences , thomas said .
