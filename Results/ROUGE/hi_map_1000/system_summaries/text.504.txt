a colossal river ice jam that caused major flooding in a remote alaska town was starting to churn wednesday as water finally chewed ice chunks away from the stubborn , frozen mass after most of the residents were forced to flee in the waterlogged town of galena . the flooding lifted homes off foundations and has threatened to break a dike protecting the airport , virtually the only dry spot left in the community of 500 where floodwaters washed out roads and submerged homes . " we did n't have any idea how vast the flood was going to be , " he said . " there are houses that are totally submerged in water up to the roof . " the weather service expected the jam to break and water to began draining from galena by late wednesday or thursday . when it does , a disaster policy cabinet will forward recommendations to gov . sean parnell , who said the flooding began with a few fingers of water covering the roads , said paul apfelbeck , a teacher . sometime on monday afternoon it began to surge koyukuk , where the service has issued a flood warning through 4 p.m. thursday .
