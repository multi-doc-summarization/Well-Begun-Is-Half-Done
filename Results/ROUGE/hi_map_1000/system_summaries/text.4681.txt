president trump said trade wars were " unacceptable " by threatening to slap a u.s. tariff of 25 % on steel imports and 10 % on aluminum . that , in turn , was met by a sharp rejection from canadian prime minister justin trudeau who called the tariffs " absolutely unacceptable " and said they would cause serious disruption of markets on both sides of the border . " if the e.u . wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on u.s. companies doing business there , we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the u.s. , " he tweeted . " they make it impossible for our cars ( and more ) to sell there . big trade imbalance ! " the tweet underscored his observation on friday that when the u.s.is losing " many billions " on trade with virtually every trading partner " trade wars are good and easy to win . " trump has routinely singled out china for its steel and aluminum exports to the us , the president said on twitter . that could spell trouble for car manufacturers like volkswagen and bmw , two of the most popular european brands sold in the u.s . the german luxury car maker also manufactures many of its cars in america , shipping billions of dollars worth abroad .
