episcopalians overwhelmingly voted wednesday to allow religious weddings for same-sex couples , solidifying the church 's canon , or rules , redefining marriage as being between two persons , instead of a man and a woman . " this is one of many bridges we need to build for the future , " said e. bruce garner . " that mutual care was present in the conversations we had . some people disagreed deeply , but we prayed and we came up with compromises that we believe make room and leave no one behind . " baker , chair of the committee that crafted the changes , said church members have not always been kind to one another but that the dynamic has changed in recent decades . " we have learned to not only care for , but care about one other , " baker said . " do n't be seduced by the fashion of society . " the episcopal church vote comes on the heels of a june 26 supreme court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states and a dramatic shift in public support for the change . the compromise means that same-sex weddings may occur after nov. 1 , 2015 , with the full blessing of the church in places like washington , the united states and australia . he also serves as an episcopal priest in a parish in florida .
