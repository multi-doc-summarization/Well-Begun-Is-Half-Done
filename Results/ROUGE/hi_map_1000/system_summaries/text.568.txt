a man has been arrested for charging his iphone on a london overground train . robin lee , a 45-year-old artist based in islington , was handcuffed and taken to a british transport police station on caledonian road after his arrest for “ abstracting electricity ” after “ becoming aggressive ” when objecting to his prior arrest . a police spokesman said a “ decision on further action would be made in due course ” ” “ i would expect them only to become live when the train is in a depot mode . i am surprised that 16a sockets are not used . i noticed these at stations ( incl farringdon ) and assumed they were for the cleaners - not that they needed the higher power rating , but to restrict the use of the socket . i have seen on a variety of stock , stickers above 13amp sockets saying " not for public use " .aiui they are provided for cleaners to use when cleaning trains in depots ; it does surprise me a little that these sockets are energised all the time . also there are 13 amp sockets and plugs that have a t shaped earth pin for the same reason .
