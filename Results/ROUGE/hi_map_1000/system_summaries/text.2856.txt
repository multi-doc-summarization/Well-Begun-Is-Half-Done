intersex five percent of male smallmouth bass and 27 % of male largemouth bass tested in waters in or near 19 national wildlife refuges in the northeast have developed " characteristics of the opposite sex . it is tied to the exposure of fish to endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can affect the reproductive system and cause the development of characteristics of intersex disrupting chemicals and 27 percent to 100 percent in the southern stretch of the potomac river . all of the affected fish had eggs where their testes should be , according to a new study by u.s. survey and u.s . " what we 're finding is the presence of immature eggs in the gonads of the male fish , " said luke iwanowicz , a usgs research biologist . " this study was designed to identify locations that may warrant further investigation . chemical analyses of fish or water samples at collection sites were not conducted , so we can not attribute the observation of intersex to specific , known estrogenic endocrineâ€”disrupting . " he added , " it is not clear what the specific cause of intersex is in these fish . " " this has basically been an indication of exposure of estrogens such as compounds as an indicator for exposures that may affect fish and other aquatic species , " he said . " we are looking at fish but , of course , there is that concern that , if this stuff is in the water , it can be affecting other wildlife . "
