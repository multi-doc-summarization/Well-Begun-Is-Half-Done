the democratic race for president unexpectedly exploded with rancor barring it from accessing its own voter data . his campaign filed a lawsuit to get it back and aggressively tried to turn the allegations into a political advantage . the party and the sanders campaign reached an agreement late friday to restore the campaign 's access to the database . " this information is really key to our campaign and our strategy , " said clinton campaign manager robby mook . " we are extremely pleased that the dnc has reversed its outrageous decision to take sen. sanders â€™ data . the information we provided tonight is essentially the same information we already sent them by email on thursday . " sanders campaign manager jeff weaver said of the democratic national committee . at issue is an extensive trove of voter information maintained by the dnc . the campaigns are able to resume its field organization after spending much of friday in limbo . however , a person familiar with the outcome and a federal judge late friday , the depth of which was debated by all involved , tore open an ugly line between two camps that had so far engaged in a relatively civil white house campaign . on the eve of the party 's next presidential debate , it also thrust into the open longstanding suspicions among sanders and his supporters that the national party is unfairly working to support clinton 's candidacy .
