giorgio armani was feeling feisty on monday , taking on some of his favorite targets at his postshow press conference : anna wintour , other italian designers and the camera della moda . his combative mood appeared to be triggered by the noticeable absence of vogue 's editor in chief from his front row earlier in the morning . " there are some who prefer to snub the giorgio armani show and go to paris , " he said . " she took an airplane , dumped mr. armani and went to paris . " armani went on to blame milan fashion week 's organisers , the national chamber for italian fashion , of which he is a board member , for making the final day on the schedule an " empty " one . the criticism comes just months after armani pledged to help relaunch the waning international fashion showcase , which has only armani , gucci , prada and dolce & gabbana as its big draws . he did n't stop there though , going on to make a veiled stab at fellow italian brands that ignore " clothes with a function and with clothes their show dates .
