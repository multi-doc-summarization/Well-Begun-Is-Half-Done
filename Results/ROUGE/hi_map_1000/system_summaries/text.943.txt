a car exploded in the hotel parking lot , but it 's not clear whether the cause of the extremist islamic state group claimed responsibility wednesday for an attack on a tripoli luxury hotel that killed 10 people , including an american and four europeans . local officials say later that at least one of the assailants had killed himself with a grenade or a suicide vest , the ap reports . the group identified the attackers as abu ibrahim al-tunsi and abu suleiman al-sudani , noms de guerre that suggest the attackers were tunisian and sudanese . the claim of responsibility was dated tuesday but first appeared on jihadi forums wednesday . " the operation is not the last one on the lands of tripoli ... let the enemies of god , the crusaders and their allies await what would harm them , " the message read . he said the car bomb left at least five cars in the parking lot burned and damaged some windows in the staff in the lobby . the staffer said the gunmen killed three guards and took hostages , but had no further information on the captives ' identities . he also said that two commercial landmark towers behind the hotel were evacuated out of security concerns . he spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters . a group calling itself the tripoli province of the islamic state , the extremist group that has seized territory in syria and iraq , issued a statement on social media taking responsibility for the attack just as it was beginning , and the timing added credibility to the claim .
