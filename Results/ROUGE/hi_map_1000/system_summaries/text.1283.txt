the family of murdered schoolgirl milly dowler , whose phone was hacked by the now-defunct tabloid news of the world , was shut down last week after she was abducted in 2002 , when rebekah brooks was editor . messages were deleted to make room for more recordings , it is claimed , and this gave the family false hope that she was still alive . mrs family lawyer mark lewis said murdoch appeared humbled and had offered " a heartfelt and what seemed to be a very sincere apology , telling them that the events that transpired at the tabloid were not in keeping with the standards of honesty and decency in the field , and not what had gone on before . " murdoch 's tone was dramatically different to that in an interview published thursday in the wall street journal . " i do n't think somebody could have held their head in their hands so many times and said that they were sorry , " lewis said . " he [ mr ] was humbled to give a full and sincere apology to the dowler family . " the ad signed by murdoch says news international is " deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected . we regret not acting faster to sort things out . "
