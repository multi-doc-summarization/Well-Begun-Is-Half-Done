the san francisco board of supervisors , made an unusual public announcement on wednesday : he takes truvada , a daily antiviral pill , to greatly reduce his risk of hiv infection by up to 99 percent if the pill is taken once a day . this makes prep one of the most effective hiv-prevention measures in existence . after consulting with my physician , i went on prep to further protect and take personal responsibility for my health . i 'm hiv-negative , and i want to remain that way . i recently decided to be public about my use of prep in order to raise awareness about this relatively new tool for preventing hiv . it 's important to encourage people at risk for hiv to talk to their medical providers about all the tools and methods available for preventing infection , including prep , and to choose the methods that are best for them . as an elected official in this role , i have an obligation to do everything in my power to support those living with hiv , increase public awareness about effective hiv prevention , and reduce stigma and shame . my journey to prep was a long one . i came to terms with myself as a gay man when i was 17 years old in 1987 , at the height of the hiv epidemic . many gay men were getting sick and dying . like many in my generation , anxiety , guilt , and shame that go along with it -- is still very real for many of us .
