" this is such a radical change in thought that it ’ s been hard for many people to get their heads around it , " says dr. monica morrow , chief of the breast service at sloan-kettering and an author of the study , which has the potential to spread to vital organs and can not be eliminated by surgery alone . experts say that the new findings , combined with similar ones from earlier studies , should change medical practice for many patients . some centers have already acted on the new information .
