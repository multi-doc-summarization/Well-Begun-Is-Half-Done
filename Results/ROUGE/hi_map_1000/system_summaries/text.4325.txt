donald trump has been catching heat for lawsuits against him and trump university , a real estate seminar business he created in 2005 . the company , which promised to teach students the mogul 's investing techniques to get rich on real estate , is now defunct . but civil lawsuits have been filed against trump 's school , with former students accusing trump of defrauding them with lofty promises to learn about buying and selling real estate . " i finally gave in , " he said . " they were teaching methods that were unethical , and they had had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals . it was a facade , a total lie . " trump 's suit alleges that the business was warned by the state 's education department as early as 2005 that it was violating state law by calling itself a university , but nevertheless continued to do business under that name for five years . 5 . trump university would " upsell " students in its initial free seminar to buy a $ 1,495 " one year apprenticeship . " he added that he was " very involved . "
