poaching thai officials are arrested earlier this month in a wildlife sanctuary to try to prove their case against a tycoon accused of poaching a leopard . construction magnate premchai karnasuta , head of a special task force with the department of national parks , wildlife and plant conservation , said the discovery of the excrement was important because it was near the campsite and he did not believe premchai would wander deep into the woods for such a purpose . he said the waste would be tested for premchai 's dna . premchai , president of italian-thai development company which built bangkok 's suvarnabhumi airport among many other major projects , denied poaching after his arrest . he and his camping colleagues have been bailed while the case is under investigation . the junta which seized power in 2014 is on the back foot over a luxury watch scandal that has engulfed the defence minister , and allegations that the ex-police chief borrowed nearly $ 10 million from a fugitive brothel owner . chaiwat limlikitaksorn has denied poaching charges levelled against him and three others . rich and influential thais have a habit of avoiding justice .
