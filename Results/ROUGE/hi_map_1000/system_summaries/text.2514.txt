ann romney has " never worked a day in her life , " he said . " i made a choice to stay home and raise five boys . believe me , it was hard work . " rosen 's campaign manager jim messina and top adviser david axelrod said that ann romney had " actually never worked " in his life . " what you have is mitt romney running around the country , saying , 'well , you know , my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues , and when i listen to my wife , that 's what i 'm hearing . ' guess what ? the faux anger from the right who view the issue of women 's rights and advancement as a way to score political points . when it comes to supporting policies that would actually help women , their silence has been deafening . i do n't need lectures from the rnc on supporting women and fighting to increase opportunities for women ; i 've been doing it my whole career . if they want to attack me and distract the public 's attention away from their nominee 's woeful record , it just demonstrates how much they just do n't get it .
