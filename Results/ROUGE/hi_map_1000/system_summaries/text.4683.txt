a chinese woman has paid over $ 1,000 to save 100 canines from being eaten during a dog meat festival , the ap reports . the dogs were later rescued to the china animal protection association a dog after a convoy of trucks carrying some 500 dogs to be sold as meat , were stopped along a highway in beijing on early april 17 , 2011 , and the local government in yulin says it can not stop legitimate businesses preparing meat in the run-up of the family unit . with their new found bond with animals , this new generation of chinese see cats and dogs as thinking , feeling individuals deserving of compassion . most importantly , they are friends not food . i believe the dog meat industry is fighting a losing battle . my own investigations and those of chinese activists and journalists all confirm its downward spiral as the cruelty involved is exposed . guangzhou , a city well known for eating dogs , is often wrongly assumed to be an ancient chinese tradition . in fact , the festival only dates back to 2009 when it was launched in the city in china 's southwest to celebrate the summer solstice .
