the annual shark week television marathon puts many marine biologists and shark enthusiasts on edge , the ap reports . " we hate the way it 's done : maximum menace and blood , a two-note soundtrack and , occasionally , a gross indifference to facts . the discovery channel , which bills itself as the " # 1 nonfiction media company " opened this year 's shark week with a fictional " documentary " . confused ? apparently , the producers were , too . they opened the documentary these words : none of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated with it in any way , nor have approved its contents . and great whites , who 've gotten all the press , have n't had their full story told , either . they sometimes move in " clans " , have splash fights , and seem to have complex social lives , despite their solitary hunting habits . they fear killer whales ; after an orca dispatched a great white , the entire region 's population of sharks vanished , including a tracked shark who dove 500m and then swam to hawaii to escape . discovery made its name as a champion for science , but it 's been abandoning that mission for years . shark week was once a paean to marine biology . it 's also true that megalodon existed , but the film 's title , megalodon : the monster shark lives , does n't exactly point out that the animal has been extinct for two million years .
