hurricane harvey has left major devastation in texas , but there is another hurricane called irma out in the atlantic that could take aim at the united states within the next week or so . irma became a hurricane early on thursday and by the evening it was upgraded to a major hurricane , which requires sustained winds greater than 110 miles . such explosive strengthening is known as " rapid intensification , " defined by the national hurricane center as having its wind . " while fluctuation in strength is likely , we expect irma to become a category 4 well before it reaches waters near the lesser antilles , " kottlowski said , per the ap . " there is the potential for irma to ramp up to an even more powerful hurricane into early week , " he said . the gulf coast continues to deal with the devastating impacts of harvey , emergency managers in the eastern atlantic with the storm still five days away from the outermost united states over the houston area within the past few days , leaving tens of thousands homeless . the damage is so devastating that texas could require as much as $ 125 billion in aid from the u.s. government , larger than the record $ 110.2 billion aid package assembled in 2005 following hurricane katrina .
