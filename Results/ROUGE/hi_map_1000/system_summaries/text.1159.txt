the republican effort to replace obamacare got a much-needed amendment with president trump to drop their opposition to the gop bill and vote for it . reps. billy long and fred upton leaving for recess without voting could doom eventual passage , but many in congress have grown frustrated with the white house pushes for a vote as early as thursday . two senior white house officials say they would oppose the bill because it could harm people with pre-existing conditions by allowing states to win waivers for insurers who wanted to charge such customers higher premiums under certain conditions . " i believe they will find broad support among [ house freedom caucus ] members for their amendment , " he said . " the health-care repeal will cut coverage from millions , raise your premiums and eliminate your protections , and nothing they are proposing changes those facts . " a politico/morning consult poll released wednesday found that 50 percent of americans oppose states to opt out pre-existing conditions would return them to the " yes " column on the bill . " this possible amendment does n't change the underlying truth of the republican health-care repeal , " upton said in a statement to politico . " it can get us both in a position we need to be on pre-existing conditions and make sure those people are covered . "
