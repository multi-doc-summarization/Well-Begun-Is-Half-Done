" i was confused , and ended up having to cough it out . i tried a few more times . that gulp just didn ’ t think about it , you ’ re only going to make it worse , " he tells news.com.au . " it is also the arch-enemy of those with dysphagia , as one of the hardest of all foods to swallow . tests have found that as a person chews bread , it tends to readily absorb saliva that would otherwise lubricate the throat . it also forms into hard , sticky balls that can prevent a smooth journey on to the oesophagus .

" she bargained to eat foods with a soft texture , like custard or yoghurt , and push them to the back of her throat while she waited for her swallowing mechanism to kick in . half the time it would take too long , and she would cough up her food .
