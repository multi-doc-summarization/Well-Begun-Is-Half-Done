a traditional dog meat festival with a 600-year history of jinhua city , where 5,000 to 10,000 dogs would be butchered on the streets and served to villagers on dining tables . " i 've seen the dogs being stabbed , strangled and even beaten into comas and thrown into boiling water . some dogs woke up in the extremely hot water and they struggled , but the vendors kept pushing them , plucking their fur , " a professor at griffith university in australia who studies animal rights law tells shanghai daily yesterday . " the government called it a traditional festival , but we know they are only attracting vendors into the city to boost economy , " he says . " some villagers argued that they had emotional attachments to the festival , as it had been passed from generation to generation , while some said it should be listed as the city 's cultural heritage . " " the reason why i posted that message online is very simple , that is , i don ’ t want to see dog lovers ’ feelings get hurt , " says an animal-welfare volunteer from hangzhou .
