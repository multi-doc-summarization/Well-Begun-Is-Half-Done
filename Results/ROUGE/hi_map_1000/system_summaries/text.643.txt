a judge has resigned over his conduct of a rape trial in the face of a blistering recommendation for his removal from a national disciplinary body . federal court justice robin camp had asked a complainant in a 2014 rape trial why she did not keep her knees together , and mocked the law of consent . at a hearing conducted last fall by a disciplinary panel established by the canadian judicial council , the 19-year-old homeless complainant said justice camp went to great lengths to save his job . he attended in-depth counselling and education sessions with several feminist scholars , three of whom testified at his disciplinary hearing last fall ( attended daily by his wife and daughter ) and he fought for an opportunity to appear in person before the larger body of judicial council members who considered the panel ’ s recommendation , to explain to them that he had acted out of “ ignorance , not animus. ” the council 's ruling reads , " i thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months , particularly my legal team , " he said . " we find that the judge 's conduct , viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences , was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality , integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judicial office .
