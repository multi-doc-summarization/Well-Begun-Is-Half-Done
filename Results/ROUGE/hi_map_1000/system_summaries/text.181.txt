republicans pushed a bill blocking planned parenthood 's federal funds through the house on friday , hoping to contain conservatives ' demands for a politically risky showdown with president barack obama by striking a quick blow against abortion . the nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic , poster-sized photo of a scarred , aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot shutdown over the organization . the votes followed months of intense focus on planned parenthood prompted by undercover videos released by an activist group claiming they show violations of federal laws prohibiting the sales of fetal tissue for profit and restricting certain abortion procedures . planned parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and claimed the videos have been unfairly manipulated as it has fought off attempts to end its federal support . but neither bill is likely to become law as senate democrats have filibustered similar measures , and president obama has indicated he would veto both bills . " the three of us agree that we want a short-term cr , " reid told reporters after the 90-minute huddle in the oval office . " we want to make sure the riders are off that , we 're here on the house floor . "
