apple 's ipad parody in 2007 ? " how will it stand up to other tablets if i pour a test tube full of blue water on it ? " the company revealed tuesday that he 'd heard rumors of the name " but dismissed it immediately , " thinking that apple would have the foresight to predict a landslide of menstruation mockery . " are there no women in the marketing or biz dev department of mac , " he said . " why ? ask any female . or glance at twitter . for example , asks @ soniamoghe : but does it have wings ? nintendo 's wii was referred to as " <unk> 's " terrible , " with one columnist writing that " ipad " would pass muster only with a man . no women were present on apple 's panel at the san francisco announcement . apple , for its part , heralded the ipad as " a magical and revolutionary device " on its web site , and did n't return a phone call for comment . this is not the first time that a widely anticipated product launch was met with ridicule , but it 's not clear what women everywhere anticipate will obviously be the ipad 's biggest problem .
