the restraining order will stay in place until another hearing next week a wisconsin federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law . the law , signed by gov . scott walker on friday , bans doctors from performing abortions if they do n't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice . " there will almost certainly be irreparable harm to those women who will be foreclosed from having an abortion in the next week either because of the undue burden of travel or the late stage of pregnancy , as well as facing increasing health risks caused by delay , " the judge wrote . " since the state has failed to date to demonstrate any benefit to maternal health of imposing this restriction , there is no meaningful counterweight recognized by the united states supreme court to justify the act 's immediate enforcement , " he said . " the current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications . " he added that the law is not needed to protect women 's health .
