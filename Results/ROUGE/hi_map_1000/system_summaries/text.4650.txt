gabrielle giffords shooting 22-year-old loughner with human skull replica in backyard tent at jared lee loughner 's home , the ap reports . " they hadn ’ t released the name , but i said , ‘ holy shit , i think it ’ s jared that did it , " he said . " as soon as the teacher started going over the syllabus , he had this outburst out of nowhere , did n't even raise his hand , and started asking the teacher some sort of weird questions about whether he believed in mind control . " loughner was the target of loughner 's rampage , prosecutors say , and the sworn affidavit accompanying the charges mentions that loughner attended a giffords event he attended during that period . he told me that she opened his voice mail , he heard a simple message from loughner and had repeatedly derided her as a " fake. " loughner 's animus toward giffords intensified after he attended one of her campaign events and she did not , in his view , sufficiently answer a question he had posed , tierney says . he also describes loughner as being obsessed with “ lucid dreaming ” —that is , the idea that conscious dreams are an alternative reality that a person can inhabit and control—and says loughner became " more interested in this world than our reality. .
