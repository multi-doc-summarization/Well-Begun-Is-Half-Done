john carter 's " john carter " is signaled early on when our hero finds himself on a strange planet that literally puts a bounce in his step . why , he could leap tall buildings in a single bound , the ap reports . " it 's just that while our hero eventually figures out how to stop falling down , the movie never does , " he said . " for all the bumps in the narrative , concocted by stanton , mark andrews and novelist michael chabon , and less-than-stellar 3d effects , john carter exerts the pull of a tall tale told by a campfire . stanton takes his time to show us how life lost meaning for captain carter after the war . and the canadian kitsch , so fine as the alcoholic bad boy on friday night lights , brings a bruised heart and welcome gravity to a role a lesser actor might have turned into heroic cardboard . it 's fun to watch jc find that the atmosphere on mars allows him to leap around like a human shot put . and though it 's shameless to give jc a mutt as a protector .
