the first full trailer for " star wars : episode vii â€” the force awakens " premiered on espn during halftime of " monday night football . " it has a whole lot to offer running at over two minutes , as it highlights many of the main characters we will follow in this chapter of the saga . " something funny is definitely going on . we 're getting to the bottom of it , " read a message on fandango 's site .
