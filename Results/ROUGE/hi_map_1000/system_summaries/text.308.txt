jill kelley , the tampa socialite connected to isaf commander john allen and former cia director david petraeus , has called police to her home several times in the last few days , and at least once tried to invoke " diplomatic protection , " reports the bbc . " she does not work as a real consul . they play a role to improve the relationship between the rok and the u.s. , " the official said , per the cable news . " there 's no implication that the south korean government has anything to do with the growing scandal that involves kelly , allen , petraeus , and paula broadwell , petraeus 's biographer and alleged mistress . but her work on behalf of the south koreans may explain some of the 20,000 to 30,000 pages of e-mails between her and allen that the defense department 's inspector general 's office is investigating now . kelley does drive a mercedes sedan with license plates that say there 's someone lurking in their yard . as the call ends , she makes the request because she was worried about the personal information being provided to investigators .
