the red hot chili peppers to the super bowl halftime show is a " real live performance , " but it 's not clear that the band 's rendition of " give it away " have anything to do with the fact that flea appeared to be playing a bass that was n't plugged in , as a number of keen-eyed observers , reports the new york daily news . " that guitar is plugged into nothing , " tweeted vernon reid . " we have been on the road for 31 years doing it . so , when this super bowl gig a great live vocal performance , such as the one mars gave at the end of his gig during rehearsals because we refused to mime properly , i played bass with my shoe , john played guitar atop anthony 's shoulders , and we basically had a wrestling match onstage , making a mockery thing for us , and anyone who has ever seen us in concert ( like the night before the red bowl at the barclays center ) , knows that we play from our heart , we improvise spontaneously , take musical risks , and sweat blood at every show .
