nasa 's decision to freeze cooperation between the nasa space agency and its russian counterpart on a slew of joint projects will hurt global space partnership but wo n't be the end of the russian space program , director of the space policy institute ivan moiseyev told ria novosti thursday . nasa issued a statement saying it put most of its joint missions with russia on hold indefinitely . the only exception is the " operational international space station activities , " the agency 's associate administrator michael o'brien said in a memo . " the statement was way too harsh , " ivan moiseyev tells ria novosti . " it means that many large-scale projects require an international effort . a freeze on cooperation will spur a serious backlash against the international space program . " nasa is laser focused on a plan to return human spaceflight launches to american soil , and end our reliance on russia to get into space . this has been a top priority of the obama administration 's for the past five years , and had our plan been fully funded , we would have returned american human spaceflight was unlikely to have any catastrophic repercussions for its industry . russia will simply have to adjust its projects to the new reality , he explained .
