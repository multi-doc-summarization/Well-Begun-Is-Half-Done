new jersey sen. cory booker gave an impassioned and unprecedented plea to the senate on wednesday to vote against donald trump 's nominee for attorney general and his fellow senator , jeff sessions . booker , civil rights legend georgia rep. john lewis and congressional black caucus chairman rep. cedric richmond each delivered emotional testimony that sessions ' record on civil rights disqualifies him from serving atop the justice department under president-elect trump . " the arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice , we must bend it , " booker said . " america needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc . sen . sessions record does not speak to that desire , intention or will . " booker became the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow sitting senator at a confirmation hearing for a cabinet position . his panel with other lawmakers and supporters of sessions was added to the hearings at the request of the top democrat on the committee , california sen. dianne feinstein , though democrats criticized chairman chuck grassley for scheduling the members of congress at the end of all proceedings .
