" so when i first talked to him it was actually kind of scary how much he knew about my daughter 's appearance . melinda [ gates ’ s wife ] didn ’ t like that too well. ” trump has a now-familiar verbal tic of referring to himself in the third person , reports the new york daily news . " we ’ re looking at a president that doesn ’ t know the third-party form was always expected , " he said . " when if he spent more time actually learning policy , if he devoted just a quarter of the time that he devotes to harassing women and gawking at women to actual policy , memorising and learning policy . i think the country would be a lot better off. . " gates , meanwhile , says it 's " a dead end , that would have a bad thing , don ’ t do that . " he added , " so clearly he had been driven away but he wanted to make a grand entrance in a helicopter. . "
