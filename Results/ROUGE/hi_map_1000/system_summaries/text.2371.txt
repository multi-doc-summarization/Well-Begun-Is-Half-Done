the bomb that exploded in manhattan on saturday contained residue of tannerite , a legal product used primarily for target practice . tannerite explodes when struck by a bullet from a high-powered rifle so ranges put it on targets as a way to prove a target has been struck . the brand-name product is defined as a " binary explosive " by the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firerams and exposives ( atf ) . this means it 's sold in two inert pieces , said jimmie oxley , a chemistry professor at the university of rhode island . it is not an explosive until the two parts are mixed , oxley said . even when two separate parts – ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder – it produces a loud bang and a puff of smoke when hit with a fast-moving bullet . that makes it more obvious—and more exciting—when you hit the target than , say , shooting a piece of paper . “ as far as our knowledge and independent testing results show , our product can only be set off by a successful high-power rifle shot directly to the target ; and in addition that once done it vaporizes as it is an endothermic product , ” the company says .
