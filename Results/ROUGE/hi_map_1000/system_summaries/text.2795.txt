tom hardy needs to book himself in for a new tattoo , but it 's not clear whether hardy 's performance would earn him an oscar nomination , and hardy humbly disagreed . " he wrote , in this really shitty handwriting : ‘ leo knows everything , ' " hardy said . " ha ! i was like , ‘ ok , i ’ ll get it done , but you have to write it properly . ' " he added , " i have n't got it yet , " he says . " if i got a big bold ‘ leo 's most glamorous ink , there are certainly worse things than being a successful actor with a dumb tattoo designed by a fellow movie star that symbolizes your academy award nomination . in fact , he 's not your average man . he has an innate , undeniable charisma on screen that puts him at the top of every director 's wish list — all right , as we 'll get on to , perhaps not all of them . " hardy 's body art is very much a statement of his commitment , but he says he would n't be able to get him into hollywood . he 's also the london skyline , a chinese dragon , his wife 's name , and a buddha with an ak47 , and he 's been in hollywood and not only to his liking . " it ’ s just that , isn ’ t it ? you bet a tattoo , you lose . "
