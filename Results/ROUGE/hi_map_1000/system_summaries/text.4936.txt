a van veered onto a promenade and barreled down the busy walkway in central barcelona on thursday , swerving back and forth as it mowed down pedestrians and turned a picturesque tourist destination into a bloody killing zone . thirteen people were killed and 100 were injured , 15 of them seriously , in what authorities called a terror attack , reports the ap . the islamic state group claimed responsibility , saying in a statement on its aamaq news agency that the attack was focusing on a house in alcanar , southwest of barcelona , which was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on wednesday . police believe the house was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in barcelona , possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there . however , the apparently accidental explosion at the house forced the conspirators to scale down their plans and to hurriedly carry out more “ rudimentary ” attacks , trapero said . a single police officer shot four of the men , while several other civilians and a police officer were injured . trapero had earlier said the investigation was killed in the catalan resort of cambrils , after they drove their car at pedestrians and police officers . the five assailants had an ax and knives in their car and wore fake explosive belts , police said .
