mitt romney is optimistic about optimism , but it 's not clear that romney has admitted that his tax cuts , if they 're not going to add to the deficit , will have to increase taxes on people he defines as middle income and cut them on the wealthy . " my own view is , " he wrote . " i want to keep the current progressivity in the code . there should be no tax reduction for high income people . " romney 's " economic plan " is " very nearly substance-free , " romney writes . " we could and should have greatly reduced the pain by combining aggressive fiscal and monetary policies with effective relief for highly indebted homeowners ; the fact that we didn ’ t reflects a combination of timidity on the part of both the obama administration and the federal reserve , and scorched-earth opposition on the middle class . " the harvard study notes that romney 's tax plan proposes to cut tax rates by 20 % , but he 's not sure that it was necessary . " if you believe that , it makes sense to argue that changing presidents would , all by itself , cause an economic revival . then , slowly , right-leaning economists and outlets began releasing their own studies showing that , if you made some really , really questionable assumptions , you could kinda sorta make romney ’ s math look like it might add up .
