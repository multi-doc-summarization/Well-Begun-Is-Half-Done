the 51st annual country music association awards kicked off with a tribute to the victims of last month 's las vegas tragedy , reports the bbc . " we ca n't be doing any of our silly little songs because this year 's show is a 'politics-free zone , ' " underwood joked . " right now , he 's probably asking siri , 'how in the hell do you spell pocahontas ? ' " the pair of 10 years did n't waste time getting to donald trump as they opened wednesday 's awards show , which came under fire last week for barring journalists from asking artists questions about gun rights , political affiliations and the recent mass shooting in las vegas . the backpedal came after paisley and others spoke out against the ban . " our music lifts people up , and that ’ s what we ’ re here to do tonight , " he said . " are you kidding me ? that 's not fair , " paisley rebuffed , offering sample lyrics of political spoofs such as , " hold me closer , bernie sanders . " in the middle of the night from the privacy of a gold-plated white house toilet seat , he writes , 'liddle bob corker , ' 'nfl ' and 'covfefe , ' . " the payoff line , however , was a chorus as cutting as it was humorous , referencing the high-stakes game some believe trump is playing with north korea . "
