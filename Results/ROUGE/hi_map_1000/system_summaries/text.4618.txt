the state of u.s.-iranian relations was adding a new wrinkle to the long negotiation aimed at curbing the islamic republic 's uranium and plutonium programs . while the two sides are arguably fighting proxy wars in israel , gaza and syria , they 're talking cooperation in iraq and afghanistan . and , perhaps in a first , the nuclear matter is possible , though there are opponents of that idea on both sides . " we are in the middle of talks about nuclear proliferation and reining in iran 's program , " kerry said . " and it 's good to begin with an agreement .
