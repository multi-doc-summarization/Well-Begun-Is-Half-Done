a dallas woman filed suit against halliburton last week claiming she was fired after her supervisors learned she was pregnant in the summer of 2009 when she apparently violated the company 's policy against procreation sexual assault cases to court , reports the huffington post . " to her knowledge , lynda was the only employee " laid off " in her area even though there were five employees who had less experience in that position than she did . none of those employees was pregnant . thus , the company retained employees in the same or similar positions with less qualifications who were not in the protected class , " he writes . " the substance applies to all contracts totaling $ 1million or more . there is a small loophole in the amendment , but it will be hard for contractors to get through it : the franken amendment includes a national security waiver , meaning that the department of defense could prevent a case from coming to court if it imperils safety measures . but , for that to happen , the secretary of defense would have to " personally explain why the waiver was used to congress and at that point make it public . "
