toronto mayor rob ford says cancer has been told he has a " 50-50 " chance of surviving his rare cancer , reports the bbc . " some people are saying that , but a lot more people are <unk> ‘ i want your name on the ballot , and asked to be treated as a serious candidate , so the least that i can do is respect that wish . which also means holding him accountable , " he said . " if they don ’ t think i ’ m up to it , then vote for someone else . " ford has been away from city hall for the past several weeks while he undergoes treatment for liposarcoma , a rare form of cancer , paid a rare visit to his office thursday afternoon . " a lot of the stuff that i ’ ve gone through , most of it ’ s been self-inflicted , but when you get hit by cancer , that ’ s not self-inflicted , " ford says . " so if your name is on the ballot. ’ s going to be focused on those things , and people want to vote for him . "
