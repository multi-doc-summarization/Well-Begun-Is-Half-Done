jimmy kimmel tripled down on his condemnation of the latest gop-led effort to repeal and replace obamacare during his monologue thursday night , who was born with a serious heart condition , the ap reports . " for donald trump , this isn ’ t about the graham-cassidy bill , " kimmel said . " it ’ s about obamacare , which he hates , because obama ’ s name is on it . he likes to have his name on things : buildings , vodka , you name it . at this point he would sign anything if it meant getting rid of obamacare . he ’ d sign copies of the quran at the barnes and noble in fallujah if it <unk> he barely knows the difference between melania and ivanka. . " kimmel has been hammering to protect people with pre-existing conditions like kimmel 's infant son , and cassidy responded by saying the late-night host has the better grasp of health policy , health care analysts say . kimmel said of cassidy , is truth on display : anyone who figured being a comedian and talk-show host was a natural fit with policy expertise has been duly warned . comedians have become public intellectuals in the popular imagination , so maybe some charity is in order . we should be open to the possibility that kimmel has deep and hidden reservoirs to lower kimmel 's self-confidence .
