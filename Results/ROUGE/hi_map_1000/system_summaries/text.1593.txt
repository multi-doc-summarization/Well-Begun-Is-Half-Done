lady gaga was among the guests in the yard of facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg on sunday night . gaga wore a black , sleeveless gaga , and high heels , and with her hair piled up to $ 35,800 per couple to attend . gaga attended as a paying guest . she said last week that she wanted to meet with obama to discuss her concerns about bullying , but it was n't clear whether the two would be having that discussion . " she checked into the cosmo , was unhappy with the room , checked out and then went to the palms , but still wasn ’ t happy and was frantically searching for a new room , " a source tells us . " it seems likely the two crossed paths during greetings inside the house before the dinner . " gaga , who is no stranger to peacock-style attention seeking , has ordered a selection of marquise-style gems to brighten websites which market and sell merchandise bearing complainant ’ s trademark. . she was looking for a private pool , which she did not hate her room and had nothing but praise for the arrival staff , butlers , etc . she checked her dental plans slip . he said : " she 's still deciding how many to get done . her dental bill will be as expensive as her jewellery bill .
