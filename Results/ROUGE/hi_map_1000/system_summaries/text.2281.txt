a plastic skull covered in house paint ? if the name damien hirst is on it , a minimum of £36,800 , or about $ 58,000 , appears to be the asking price , reports the telegraph . " a painting probably has the most shocking increase in value from what it costs to make to what you sell it for . but you 'd never look at a rembrandt and say , 'that 's just wood and canvas and paint - how much ? ! ' " he writes . " it ’ s all about how many people want it . it works on a pair of jeans as well - they 're just material and stitching and as soon as you walk out of the shop , they ’ re worth nothing . " asked if the gift shop skull would hold its value , he replied : " maybe on ebay you might be all right for a bit , " he said , per the guardian . " i 'm not going to do so . " the telegraph notes that the telegraph reports that visitors will be assaulted by the smell of a thousand years ( $ 79 million ) , and perhaps the inspiration behind the limited-edition souvenir skulls .
