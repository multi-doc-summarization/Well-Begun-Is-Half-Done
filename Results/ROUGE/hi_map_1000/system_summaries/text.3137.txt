the republican presidential field strayed away from the central 2012 topic of jobs thursday night to wage a pitched debate over a pair of far more explosive issues : immigration and social security . in the orlando debate ’ s most dramatic clash , rick perry defended himself from a multi-front attack on his immigration record , struggling to fend off rivals he called heartless for their attitude towards the children of undocumented immigrants . " that kind of magnet draws people into this country to get that education , " romney said . " we have to turn off the magnet of extraordinary government . " perry said , " if you say that we should not educate children that have come into our state for no other reason than they ’ ve been brought here by no fault of their own , i don ’ t think they have a heart. . " romney also said that perry had achieved his goal of knocking mr. romney down a few pegs from what has been a rare debate moment that put the staunchly conservative perry on the defensive by attacks from the right . but it was not the only moment in the evening where perry appeared unsteady or unfocused in his performance .
