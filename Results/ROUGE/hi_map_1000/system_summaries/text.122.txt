former berkshire hathaway executive david sokol deliberately misled warren buffett when pitching an investment to him , the company 's board concluded in a scathing report that may add fuel to a pending sec probe of buffett 's one-time heir apparent . the board said it may sue sokol to recover the $ 3 million of trading profit he made when berkshire bought chemicals company lubrizol corp and could seek damages from him for harm to the company , reports the ap . the company will cooperate with any government probe in the matter as well . " i have known mr. sokol and have represented his companies in business litigation since the mid 1980s , " said barry levine of the washington firm dickstein shapiro . " he would not , and did not , trade improperly , nor did he violate any fair reading of the berkshire hathaway policies . " levine , 80 , told buffett in january he had a stake in lubrizol , which the billionaire chairman took to mean that sokol had been following the company as a shareholder and then deemed it a takeover candidate , the audit committee found . buffett previously said he would have nothing further to say about sokol 's actions , a stance that became untenable over time given the intense pressure on the conglomerate .
