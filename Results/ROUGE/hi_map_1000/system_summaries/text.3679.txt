the first time in 27 years , the definition of alzheimer 's disease is being recast in new medical guidelines that reflect fast-mounting evidence that it begins ravaging the brain years before the symptoms of dementia . the guidelines , to be issued tuesday by the national institute on aging and the alzheimer 's association , divide the disease into three stages : a phase when dementia has developed , a middle phase in which mild problems emerge but daily functions can still be performed , and the most recently discovered phase , in which no symptoms are evident but changes are brewing in the brain . " we ’ re redefining alzheimer ’ s disease and looking at this in a different way than had ever been done , " says william thies , chief medical and scientific officer for the johns hopkins alzheimer 's alzheimer , who led the new guidelines that were published . " early diagnosis is really the key to this , " he said . " oftentimes family members notice the symptoms in their loved ones , but it ’ s only years later that they get diagnosed or understand what resources are . "
