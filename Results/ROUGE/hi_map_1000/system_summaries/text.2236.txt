lady gaga is on the promotional trail—and she 's dressed to kill . last night , she launched her newest album , artpop , which boasts collaborations with all sorts of artists , and arrived at the launch party wearing nothing less than a flying dress . the brains behind the flying frock—think hexacopter-style aerial drone up top , attached to a platform with a fiberglass bodice and skirt—is techhaus , part of the haus of gaga . the dress , which gaga calls volantis , seems to be a symbol of the voices of today 's youth . " i wanted to make today about something even more important to me , and that something is the youth of the world , " gaga said . " their minds are just so boundless . they 're just so inspiring . " the singer appeared at the event alongside two of the artists she 's been working with , jeff koons and marina abramovic . artpop is being released later today and is already doing brisk business on itunes . gaga 's march toward the top of the american chart was slow but " just dance , " and " poker face .
