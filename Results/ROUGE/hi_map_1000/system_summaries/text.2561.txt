the harvard men 's cross country team produced yearly spreadsheets about members of the women 's team , sometimes writing “ sexually explicit ” comments about them , the ap reports . according to the crimson , the men guessed which women would invite certain men to the event . in certain spreadsheets , the team created the spreadsheets each year ahead of an annual dance with the women ’ s soccer team , which produced an explicit document evaluating freshmen recruits on the women ' s team on their perceived sexual appeal , prompting current and former members of a fake anonymity offered to us by numerous news outlets , we have decided to speak for ourselves . when first notified of this “ scouting report ” each of us responded with surprise and confusion , but ultimately brushed off the news as if it didn ’ t really matter . in all , we do not pity ourselves , nor do we ache most because of the personal nature of this attack . more than anything , we are frustrated that this is a reality that all women have faced in the past and will continue to face throughout their lives . we feel hopeless that it took a public revelation , a loss of trust , and damaged friendships for us to fully grasp the gravity of our conduct , for which each member of our team takes full and equal responsibility . no woman deserves to be treated in this manner ; not our mothers , our sisters , nor not to burden them with further distractions . now that the athletic department has decided to terminate our season , we feel it is not worth our time or effort to dwell on .
