sony had an event today and as expected to shift focus from the living room to the gamer , sony said , and overall , playstation ’ s approach is meant to make it possible for gamers to play wherever they want , whenever they want . ps4 lead system architect mark cerny talked about how the evolution of the ps4 came about , saying it began five years ago , earlier on in the life of the ps3 . the ps3 was a first step , which was designed to connect to a variety of services , but it was limited because of how early it launched in that world , cerny said . " by game creators , for game creators . it is a powerful and accessible system , " he says . " much less value is found today in blast processing or a system-on-a-chip . " it 's not clear whether it will be any solid state action , but the tech remains important , he stressed . " the first expensive , gorgeous era of gaming is here : the playstation 4 . everything looks better , yes , but not of an oh my hell , nothing-else-like-it-even-close leap . like , this time around there was a strong emphasis on ease of development , hence the use of a standard x86 pc cpu , " writes <unk> . " but we 're not disappointed—there are absolutely scenes we 've seen so far that could 've only been pre-rendered on a ps3 or xbox 360 and this thing is n't even out yet . face a demo by quantic dream showing off realtime facial detail running straight off the ps4 was brilliant .
