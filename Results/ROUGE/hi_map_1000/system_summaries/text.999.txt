a veteran who collapsed in a cafeteria at albuquerque 's veterans affairs hospital died after waiting 30 to 25 minutes to get to the same hospital 's emergency room , located about 500 yards away , a va spokeswoman confirmed thursday . it took a half an hour for the ambulance to be dispatched and take the man from one building to the other , which is about a five-minute walk from the emergency room . they asked that he remain unidentified because they are considering legal action . va officials told the man 's family he collapsed at 12:19 p.m . staff followed policy in calling 911 when the man collapsed on monday , she said . " our policy is under expedited review . they have so many workers . they could have put him on the gurney and run faster than that ambulance . " paul bronston , a california emergency-room physician and chair of ethics and professional policy committee of the american college of medical quality , said it may sound ridiculous that staff had to call 911 but that practice is the standard at hospitals . typically , an ambulance would arrive faster , and other factors can stall workers trying to rush patients
