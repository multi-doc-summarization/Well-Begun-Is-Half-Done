an irish woman terminally ill with multiple sclerosis lost her battle for the lawful right to die in the first case of its kind to be brought in ireland , dublin 's high court said on thursday . marie fleming , a 59-year-old former university lecturer who is completely paralysed , made an impassioned plea last month to establish the right of her partner of 18 years to help her die , an act that could currently see him jailed in mainly roman catholic ireland . the three-judge high court ruled today the absolute ban is justified to protect vulnerable others from involuntary death and does not breach marie fleming 's personal autonomy and equality rights under the constitution and european convention on human rights . the mother of two adult children had told the court in a composed manner last month how her life had become totally undignified and too painful to bear , and said she had planned every detail , including funeral arrangements . her partner hugged and kissed her after the judgement was handed out and , reading a statement on her behalf outside the court , her solicitor said fleming greatly appreciated the enormous support she had received from members of the public . " there are no words to express the difficulty we had in arriving at this decision , " he said . " yet the fact remains that if this court were to unravel a thread of this law by even the most limited constitutional adjudication in her favour , it would - or at least might - open a pandora 's box which would be impossible to close .
