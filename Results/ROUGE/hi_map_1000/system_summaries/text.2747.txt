the bengals of gang green 's win over the bengals in the season finale , but it 's not clear . the jets won their first playoff game in five years , advancing to the afc divisional round with a 24-14 wild-card victory over a bengals saturday at paul brown stadium . led by rookie mark sanchez and his cast of cincinnati kids , the jets announced themselves as a serious postseason contender - just like rex ryan had predicted . " i think this is just the first step in what we all feel is going to be a great journey , " ryan tells the team . " so what 's their excuse now ? " the jets ' improbable run will continue on the road , as they will meet the top-seeded colts or the second-seeded chargers next weekend . " we ca n't get much higher than what i predicted , " he said . " there 's only one game ball , and it goes to woody . " ryan , who attended the game with family members less than a week after the tragic death of his daughter , says he was an emotional day for the entire organization , and grew the hammer in the fourth quarter with two late sacks . sanchez , playing like the franchise quarterback the jets believe he can be , was magnificent . he completed 12 of 15 passes for 182 yards and a touchdown , fooling the bengals with bootleg passes off play-action . and two incompletions came on drops , including a killer by braylon edwards on what should have been a 41-yard touchdown . sanchez became only the fourth rookie quarterback in nfl history to win a playoff game .
