a rare polar bear-brown bear hybrid animal has been challenged in the royal society journal , with bear skulls at the smithsonian 's national museum of natural history , the bbc reports . the yeti , a legendary shaggy , bipedal beast from the himalayas , made headlines last year when he noticed the researchers only used a fragment of a gene to identify the species . he and a colleague looked up the genetic sequence of the two hair samples in genbank , a database of publicly available dna sequences . " we made this discovery that basically that fragment of dna is not informative to tell apart two species of bears : the brown bear and [ modern-day alaskan ] polar bear , " guti√©rrez tells live science . " there is essentially no reason to believe that they [ the hairs ] belong to a species other than the brown . " the study notes that the yeti is a large and elusive ape-like beast , but it 's not clear whether the hair samples likely belong to the himalayan brown bear , he says . the new york times notes that scientists have found the " yeti " hair samples to the jawbone of an ancient polar bear jawbone found in svalbard , norway , that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago .
