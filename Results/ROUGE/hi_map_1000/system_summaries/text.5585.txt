mitt romney appears to have altered his position on the obamacare ban on denying insurance to people with pre-existing conditions in an interview with the columbus dispatch editorial board . " you have to deal with those people who are currently uninsured , and help them have the opportunity to have insurance , " romney said . " but then once people have all had that opportunity to become insured , we just say to you , ‘ tough luck , you ’ re going to die when you have your heart attack , ' " he said , per the bbc . " we 're losing more americans every day because of inaction ... than drunk driving and homicide combined , " he says . " no , you go to the hospital , you get treated , you must take this person now that they ’ re sick , ’ or there ’ d literally be no reason to have insurance. . " he also argued that not having insurance does not in itself lead to deaths . he pointed to federal law that requires hospitals to admit emergency patients , repeating his advice that patients rely on his suggestion that uninsured americans can find the care they need in emergency rooms , telling the dispatch that people will always receive the treatment they need , and do not die or suffer because they can not pay for care , the new york times reports .
