the federal reserve took no new steps to support the economy wednesday , but stopped short of doing so right away . the decision to make what amounted to a conditional promise of action came wednesday at the end of the central bank 's two-day policy meeting . in an uncharacteristically strong statement , the fed said it was ready to act if job growth did not improve . the statement , released after a meeting of the fed ’ s policy-making committee , said that the rate of economic growth had slowed in recent months and was likely to remain " moderate over coming quarters. ” " the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability , " he said . " we still expect they will , assuming that growth remains fairly sluggish , but for now at least the statement keeps the debate open . " bernanke will be released before the committee reconvenes sept. 12 and 13 . the absence of action appeared to disappoint some equity investors .
