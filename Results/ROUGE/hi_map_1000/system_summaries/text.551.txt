cnet 's founders announced in a company blog post monday that they will move toward retiring the existing service in the next few months , reports the new york daily news . " we believe more than ever that the phone will be the primary reading device globally over the next decade , " they wrote . " looking forward , we feel this is best seized by taking on new opportunities to fully realize our vision for ebooks . " google is resistant to the notion that it bought oyster . google confirmed that it has hired " a portion of the oyster team " to work at google play books but declined to provide further details . a report in recode said , citing unnamed sources , that the hiring includes oyster 's ceo and two co-founders . google was not immediately available to comment to cnet . oyster , which was founded in 2012 and launched its service a year later , took a novel approach to the e-book market , formerly offering only a subscription book service for $ 9.95 a month . the idea attracted the attention of amazon , which last year launched a rival subscription service dubbed kindle unlimited that offered all-you-can-eat e-books and audiobooks for $ 9.99 per month . despite amazon 's entry into subscription ebook market , oyster 's model did little to replace traditional book sales , mostly because binge-reading is more difficult than binge-watching movies . consumers , who are flocking to other subscription services like netflix and spotify , appear reluctant to sign up with the equivalent for books .
