nasa 's voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new region at the far reaches of our solar system for a long time now , is finding it difficult to say goodbye . scientists say they believe this is the final region voyager 1 has to cross before reaching interstellar space . voyager 1 may remain within the heliopause for another two to three years , but it 's hard to anticipate how long it will be until the probe leaves the solar system , nasa scientists said . the heliosphere is a huge bubble the sun creates around itself , through the solar wind . the interstellar medium is a particle wind outside of the heliosphere , away from the influence of the sun 's magnetic fieldâ€¦ eventually . ed stone , voyager project scientist , based at caltech , when voyager 1 crossed a point in space called the termination shock , the spacecraft has been exploring the heliosphere 's outer layer , called the heliosheath . before voyager got close to the edge , scientists thought the boundary would be quite clear cut . now they are realising that it is much messier than they anticipated . scientists working on voyager are looking for three key signs to confirm when the spacecraft exits the heliosphere . we should see the particles created by high energy cosmic rays in number , and slow particles from inside the heliosphere should disappear .
