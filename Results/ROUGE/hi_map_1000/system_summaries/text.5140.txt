a man suspected of killing one of former president george h.w . bush 's doctors may have been seeking revenge for his mother , who died on the doctor 's operating table more than 20 years ago , authorities say wednesday . joseph james pappas , 62 , was a patient of dr. mark hausknecht , who was fatally shot as he rode his bicycle to work at houston methodist hospital on july 20 . police earlier said pappas was born in 1953 . houston police released a day before showed the suspect , whom someone said they recognized . police got a search warrant and went to pappas ' home , but he was not there . acevedo said pappas had made phone calls indicating he was considering suicide . the suspect has not been seen in almost two days . " this man is dangerous . this man has some skills ( with firearms ) , " he said . " so , it appears that this may be a 20-year-old grudge that this man held . there was a lot of planning and , sadly , some skill . " cnn called a phone number listed for pappas ' real estate company on wednesday , but the call went to voice mail . that phone number also is linked to recent listings on a firearms auction website for several guns , ammunition , tactical vests and ballistic plates for car doors . the posts , from a user in houston , apparently went online days after hausknecht was shot . it is unclear whether any of the firearms listed online were used in the shooting .
