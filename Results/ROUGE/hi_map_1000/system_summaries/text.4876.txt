belgium 's royals set to begin paying taxes for the first time since belgium declared independence in 1830 , members of the royal household will now have to pay taxes . backed up by two parties in the opposition , the ruling coalition on wednesday approved the reform . king albert ii , who turns 79 on thursday and who enjoys an annual tax-free allowance of 11.5 million euros ( us $ 15 million ) , will be exempt however , because the constitution does not allow changing rules for the reigning royal . instead , it is the king 's children and the widow of king baudouin , had planned to pass on an estate in spain by using a trust to avoid paying tax . the plan drew criticism from prime minister elio di rupo . under the new system , approved by the belgian government late on wednesday , only the monarch , the heir and his or her spouse and also the widow or widower of a deceased monarch will continue to receive money from the state . a monarch who abdicated would also receive an allowance . the royal family will also lose its exemptions from paying income and value-added tax .
