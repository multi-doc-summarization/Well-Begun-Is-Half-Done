wikileaks founder julian assange thursday renewed his attack on a film about the whistleblowing drama , but the wikileaks founder later declined to meet with the british actor while again voicing his displeasure with the film . " i believe you are a good person , but i do not believe that this film is a good film , " assange wrote . " it has real names , real places , and looks like it is covering real events , but it is still a dramatic and cinematic work , and it invents or shapes the facts to fit its characters and trajectories . but i must speak directly . i hope that you will take such directness as a mark of respect , and not as an unkindness . i think i would enjoy meeting you . the bond that develops between an actor and a living subject is significant . if the film reaches distribution we will forever be correlated in the public imagination . our paths will be forever entwined . each of us will be granted standing to comment on the other for many years to come and others will compare our characters .
