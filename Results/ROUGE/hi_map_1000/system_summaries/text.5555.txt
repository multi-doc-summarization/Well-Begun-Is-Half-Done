the world 's 7.6 billion people represent just 0.01 % of all the carbon stored in living creatures , reports the new york times . the planet 's real heavyweights are plants , but it 's not clear whether it 's a " comprehensive question in biology , yet a global quantitative account of the biomass of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories , geographic locations , and trophic modes . " " we show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 gt c of marine biota , doubling the previous estimated quantity . our analysis reveals that the global numbers could be more or much compared to trees , earthworms or even viruses , according to a study in the monday , may 21 , 2018 , proceedings of the national academy of sciences . humans only add up to about one ten-thousandth of the life on earth , measured by the dry weight of the carbon that makes up the structure of all living things , also known as biomass . but we really know how to throw what little weight we have around , " the study notes . " i was shocked to find there wasn ’ t already a comprehensive , holistic estimate of all kingdoms of life . "
