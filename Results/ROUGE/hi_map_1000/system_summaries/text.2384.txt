former president bill clinton made a more comprehensive case for president obama 's re-election in 49 minutes on wednesday than the rest of the speakers at the democratic convention could muster in the 11-1/2 hours that preceded him . in a detailed and passionate endorsement of his former rival , clinton amplified the central argument of obama 's campaign : that voters face a choice between democratic policies that lead to broad prosperity or republican policies that benefit the wealthy at the expense of everyone else . there was no mention of the role that the president and the democrats have played in grinding compromise to a halt on some of the most important issues facing the country . that was among the lines by the former president and others wednesday that either cherry-picked facts or mischaracterized the opposition . a look at some of them : clinton : " when times are tough , constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world , cooperation works better . ... unfortunately , the faction that now dominates the republican party does n't see it that way . they think government is the enemy and compromise is weakness . one of the main reasons america should re-elect president obama is that he is still committed to cooperation .
