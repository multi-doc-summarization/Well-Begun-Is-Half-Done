the creature monster is a plane , but it 's not clear whether it was a bird or a plane . the state has been named after francis tully , the amateur who discovered it in 1958 in the mazon creek in illinois , the new york times reports . " the frustrating thing is that these morphological features are not typical of any group , " he said . " but they do not rule out any group very easily. . " in a paper published in the journal nature wednesday , the tully was a mollusk , like a snail , and a find that " changes it from a mystery to a fishlike organism that is probably on the lineage leading to what we would recognize as lampreys . " " it 's one of the examples that i heard about since i was a kid , " says a paleontologist and lead author on the paper . " it didn â€™ t make sense to us that there would be this one animal that would fossilize its gut completely differently . " he adds that " we discovered that this feature was the notochord , the primitive backbone . "
