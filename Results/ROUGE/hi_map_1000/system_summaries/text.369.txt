nasa 's hubble space telescope have discovered that the universe is expanding 5 % to 9 % faster than expected , the ap reports . the numbers suggest the universe will appear in an upcoming issue of the astrophysical 's expansion , which will be detailed in a forthcoming pace than previously predicted . astronomers ' team made the discovery by refining the universe 's current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy , reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent . the team looked for galaxies containing both cepheid stars and type ia supernovae . cepheid stars pulsate at rates that correspond to their true brightness , which can be compared with their apparent brightness as seen from earth to accurately determine their distance . type ia and the dark energy it carries may explain the acceleration of the entire universe , it constitutes a nobel prize in 2011 . but what exactly is the speed of that expansion ? " this surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " said study leader and nobel laureate adam riess of the space telescope science institute and the johns hopkins university , both in baltimore , maryland . the new numbers indicate that the rate of expansion of our universe ( the so-called “ hubble constant ” ) is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec . in slightly less baffling terms , space is expanding fast enough to essentially double the distance between our galaxy and our nearest neighbors in about 10 billion years .
