the texas state board of education approved a resolution today that requires publishers to correct a " pro-islamic/anti-christian bias " in future world history textbooks.the resolution , which narrowly passed 7-6 , cites instances of an alleged emphasis on unfavorable events in christian history as told in school textbooks , while claiming that the same textbooks gloss over similar events in islamic history . " it is hard not to conclude that the members who voted for this resolution were solely interested in playing on fear and bigotry in order to pit christians against muslims , " miller said in a statement . " we are allowing ourselves to be distracted by this narrow-minded resolution . it â€™ s crazy , " he said . " this resolution will ensure upfront that potential biases are taken care of before these books reach the board . " the resolution , who tried to derail the resolution with a series of parliamentary maneuvers , called the proposal a waste of time that called on publishers to treat all religions with balance and accuracy in their textbooks . " what we 're trying to do is prohibit and send a clear message to the publishers that [ the bias ] should not happen in the future , " said chairwoman gail lowe , r-lampasas , who supported the resolution . she noted that the resolution is not legally binding on publishers , but does state the will of board members to have more balanced social studies books .
