justice anthony kennedy 's death of the opening on wednesday in senate as flake demands tariff vote gillibrand incorrectly claims no democrats voted for trump 's first supreme court nominee more than a year in 2016 . mcconnell blocked garland , former president obama ’ s nominee for that seat , from getting even a hearing . he said at the time that voters needed to help decide the ideological balance of the court by picking a new president . " millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president 's nominee , and their voices deserve to be heard , " he said . " this is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful institutions in american life . but the decorous , gentle equilibrium of yesteryear was also nonsensical . there 's always been something bizarre about the idea that a position as important , as long-serving , and as irreversible as supreme court justice should be made based on qualifications rather than ideology . politics isn ’ t a résumé competition , it 's a contest for power , and the wielding of that power has real consequences .
