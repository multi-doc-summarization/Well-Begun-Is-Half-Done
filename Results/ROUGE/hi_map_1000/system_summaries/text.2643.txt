george washington 's name is tied to george may be a faulty one . the 2000 u.s. census counted 163,036 people with the last name washington , 90 percent of whom were african-american , a far higher black percentage than for any other common name , the ap reports . the story of how washington became the " blackest name " begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the civil war , when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname . by choosing the name , he says , reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation 's history , as george washington , who died in 1799 , was still hugely popular at the time . alternately , the name could have been a way to maintain ties to plantation owners who continued to be powerful regional figures after the us war . then again , " it 's a myth , " writes washington . " in theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery , but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped . " the name is so heavily african-american that many present-day washingtons are " surprised to learn " that white washingtons exist , having never met one .
