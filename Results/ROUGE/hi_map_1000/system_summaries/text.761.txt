a new study from the university of york shows that female starlings that had been exposed to small doses of fluoxetine , the generic name for prozac , became less attractive to male starlings , which sung to them less often and treated them more aggressively . kathryn arnold , one of the study ’ s authors and a senior lecturer in ecology at the university , described it as " the first evidence that low concentrations of an antidepressant can disrupt the courtship of songbirds. ” " they were blowing hot and cold , " she says . " these cocktails of pharmaceuticals are drugs that your medical provider would never prescribe in combination with one another . " arnold said it 's " definitely not saying that it 's bad to take antidepressants , but certainly there is a greater need for new technologies to clean out sewage , " he said . " they chased them , they pecked them . they could be passive. ” she says that birds , who is used to judge potential mates , has been eating the prozac-laced worms , males only sang half as often and for half as long as they did when they were paired with a low concentration of prozac . " there is growing evidence around the world that shows that we need to be taking a look at what it is we ’ re pumping out , " arnold tells the washington post . " we found no effect of female treatment on female courtship behaviour . female body condition , circulating testosterone and circulating oestradiol were unaffected by treatment and did not account for male preference .
