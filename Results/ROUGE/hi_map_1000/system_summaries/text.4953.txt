mitt romney is only trying to double the size of his beachfront at the red arrow diner in manchester were n't happy with the mitt romney picture they have on their wall of fame . it 's out of focus , they told him the other morning.as he was about to leave , one of them grabbed him by the arm . ' i need you , too , " she said to me.well , i thought , that 's using her head . she can get a new photo of romney and get me for the same price . finally , i would be up there with adam sandler and other important people.my dream lasted until the waitress handed me her camera . i do n't remember the last time i was asked to photograph a presidential candidate . it might have been ronald reagan.i watched romney interact with the morning and political foes raw meat right now by filing for permits to tear down a la jolla , calif. , beach house and quadruple its size ? that was the wire story we had run the day before , and it was all over the internet . it ought to be what we in the profession strive for , rather than to have the story fit a preconceived notion .
