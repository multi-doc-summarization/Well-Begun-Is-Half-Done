one of the secret service supervisors ousted from the agency this week for their involvement in the colombia prostitution scandal made light of his official protective work on his facebook page , joking about a picture of himself standing watch behind sarah palin . david randall chaney , 48 , posted several shots of himself on duty in a dark suit and sunglasses , including one that shows him behind the 2008 republican vice presidential nominee during that campaign . " i was really checking her out , if you know what i ( sic ) mean ? " palin told fox . " the president , for one , he better be wary , there , of when secret service is accompanying his family on vacation . they may be checking out the first lady instead of guarding her . " palin said the scandal is " a symptom of government run amok . " " it â€™ s our ultimate position that nothing they may or may not have done in colombia negatively impacted the efficiency of their mission , " he said . " perhaps it would be in the interests of a complete and thorough and fair investigation not to make determinations about the conclusions of an investigation before they 've even been reached . "
