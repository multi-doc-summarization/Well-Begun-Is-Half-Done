the world reporter at the centre of phone hacking allegations has been questioned by police , his solicitor has said . sean hoare , a second former news of the world , was asked to look into the issue of mps phones being hacked in its possession since august 2006 , when mulcaire was arrested and his records seized , but failed to say anything to miller until her lawyer , mark thomson , of atkins thomson , wrote to ask them . " our client only discovered that the metropolitan police held this information on 15 october 2009 in response to our letter of 10 july 2009 , " he said . " if the committee decides that phone hacking does not amount to contempt it would be expected to hold only a brief inquiry , and would be unlikely to call any witnesses from the us of people who change the factory settings on their phones . " the bbc notes that scotland 's lawyer says she was " at a very early stage " and said he was n't treated by police as a suspect . " an interview under caution would follow someone being arrested as a commons , including new messages being recorded as old before she had listened to them . for this reason , they said , she had changed her mobile number , but the material seized from mulcaire suggested he had been wrong to publish stories and photographs about her private life .
