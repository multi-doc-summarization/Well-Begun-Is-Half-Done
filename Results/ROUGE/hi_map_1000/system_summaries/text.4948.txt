a local college graduate is gaining popularity all over social media today , but it 's not clear that it 's a black male student in a predominately white university . " i was just sitting around and thinking about the things i went through to get here and to graduate , " reeder said . " that one thing stood out to me . " reeder , who works two jobs to support his family , says he did n't have a father figure growing up . instead of being angry , he and nine students formed an organization to mentor young boys , teach them what he had to learn the hard way . " just because somebody says you ca n't do something seems hard or it â€™ s something your family is not used to doing , you can be the change , " he says . " but i 'm the oldest of all my brothers and sisters so i had to go to basic training for the army and i came back to work hard to get my scholarship back . " he added , " i looked at the picture and the emoji of me laughing i thought that was an ironic situation - we are in two different situations in our lives . "
