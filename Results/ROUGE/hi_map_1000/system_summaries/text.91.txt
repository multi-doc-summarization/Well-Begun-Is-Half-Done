donald trump is using the paper to attack him and the other political enemies who would force the massive online retailer to pay more in taxes . trump told sean hannity in an interview thursday that bezos is " bad " and " wrong " and , " in many cases they have no proper information . they 're slopping them together and they 're going to do a book , " he said . " every hour we 're getting calls from reporters from the washington post asking ridiculous questions , " trump tells fox news . " and the book is going to be all false stuff because the stories are so wrong . " bezos , who bought the post in 2013 from longtime owners the graham family , has assigned 20 reporters to investigate the real estate mogul 's life . " we ca n't let him get away with it , " said trump . " because he 's got a huge antitrust problem because he was controlling so much of what they are doing . " he added , " we 're never going to get the whole story , of course , but we can get the best attainable . "
