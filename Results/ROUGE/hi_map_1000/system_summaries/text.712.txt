tiger woods did his best to stay clear of controversy sunday when he was asked after the final round of the northern trust about his relationship with president donald trump . woods has played golf with trump , including after he was elected in 2016 and again last year at thanksgiving with golfers dustin johnson and brad faxon . " like i said yesterday , i 'm a man on a mission right now , two missions , actually , " said a four-shot victory in the opening fedex cup season . " we 've played golf together . we 've had dinner together . i 've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency . " trump weighed in monday morning on twitter , praising woods ' answers and recent play . the fake news media worked hard to get tiger woods to say something that he did n't want to say . tiger would n't play the game - he is very smart . more importantly who is in the office , you may like , dislike personality or the politics , but we all must respect the office . asked if he had any more to say about the state and discourse of race relations , woods said : " no . i just finished 72 holes and am really hungry .
