eight indian women have died and 20 others were in critical condition tuesday after undergoing sterilization in a free government-run program to help slow the country 's population growth . a total of 83 women , all poor villagers under the age of 32 , had the operations saturday in a hospital outside bilaspur city in the central state of chhattisgarh . the doctor breached guidelines that limit surgeons from performing more than 30 sterilizations a day , said the official , who asked not to be named because details of the investigation are private . he also failed to disinfect the instruments before using them again , the official said . " it is unfortunate that such an incident occurred in a scheme of national importance. , " raman singh , the state 's chief minister , tells reporters at a news conference today . " the most appalling and terrifying thing is that it â€™ s so commonplace in india for women to suffer these surgeries . " india 's central government had said it stopped setting targets for sterilizing women in the 1990s . each of the women had received a payment of 600 rupees , or about $ 10 , to participate in the sterilization program , mandal said .
