the supreme court was asked to consider petitions for certiorari in seven separate cases challenging state laws barring legal recognition of same-sex marriage , the ap reports . in each case , an appeals court had ruled that the court is waiting for a circuit court to rule against gay marriage before revisiting marriage as the union of a man and a woman . a final ruling is n't likely before june 2015 , but a decision to get involved could come as soon as the end of this month . as a practical matter , however , this decision not to hear these cases is an earthquake for gay rights . the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , which covers maryland , virginia , west virginia , north carolina and south carolina , refused to issue a stay halting its order favoring marriage equality .

" the ap notes that gay marriage bans are unconstitutional .
