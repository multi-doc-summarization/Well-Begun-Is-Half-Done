justin timberlake has been two birds of the same feather , small-town kids , doing the same thing , and timberlake told vanity fair . " she is the most special person , o.k. ? i don ’ t want to say much more , because i have to protect things that are dear to me—for instance , " he said . " i wo n't speak on her , but at least for me , i was a totally different person . i just do n't think we were normal ; there was nothing normal about our existence . we spent way too much time being the biggest thing for teenyboppers . " he added , " i think the mistake is that people commit to who that person is right then and not the person they ’ re going to become . that ’ s the art of staying together , is changing together . " timberlake , who has been on a plane , tells vanity fair that he has n't spoken to ex , britney spears , in " nine or 10 years . " " why do you think we wind up dating each other , and feeling more comfortable around each
