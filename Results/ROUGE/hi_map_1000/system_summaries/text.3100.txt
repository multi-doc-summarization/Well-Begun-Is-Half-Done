maj. nidal hasan is acting as his own attorney but declined to address jurors after prosecutors wrapped up their closing argument . when the judge told hasan he could begin , he said : " the defense chooses not to make a closing statement . " prosecutors said there was " no doubt " that hasan had planned and carried out the deadliest mass shooting ever on a u.s. military base . hasan is facing numerous counts of premeditated murder for the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the army post in central texas . he could face the death penalty if convicted . the army psychiatrist told jurors during a brief opening statement nearly two weeks ago that evidence would " clearly show " he was the shooter , and he described himself as a soldier who had " switched sides . " but since then , he has sat mostly silent . hasan has raised few objections during the 13-day trial , which would allow them to go through the processing center , he says . he also presented only a single piece of evidence : an evaluation from his boss that called him a good soldier .
