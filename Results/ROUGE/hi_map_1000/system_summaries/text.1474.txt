south korea 's kim jong yang was elected as a victory for the white house and its european partners , who had lobbied up until the final hours before the vote against alexander prokopchuk 's attempts to be named the next president of the policing organization . the u.s. and others expressed concern that if russia 's candidate had been elected , that would have led to further kremlin abuses of interpol 's red notice system to go after political opponents and fugitive dissidents . russia accused its critics of running a " campaign to discredit " its candidate , calling prokopchuk a respected professional . groups campaigning to clean up interpol celebrated the win , as did south korea . kim 's win means he secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at interpol 's general assembly in dubai on wednesday . he will serve until 2020 , completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor , meng hongwei , who was detained in china as part of a wide anti-corruption sweep there . kim , a police official in south korea , was serving as interim president after meng 's departure from the post and was senior vice president at interpol . russia 's interior ministry said after the vote that prokopchuk , who is one of three vice presidents at interpol , will remain in that position .
