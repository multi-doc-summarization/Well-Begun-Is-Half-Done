a detroit teen was stopped during an alleged robbery at a chase bank on the west side monday after a quick-thinking teller locked him between a set of automatic doors until police came . detroit police officer dan donakowski said the teen gave the teller a note and threatened to use a bomb if she did n't fork over the cash . " the teller complied , gave him some money and as he attempted to leave , the teller hit the button for the doors that automatically lock and the suspect was trapped inside , " donakowski said . the teen was detained by police and transported to a juvenile facility , he said . it 's unclear if the teen will face charges as a juvenile or in the adult court system . he 'd make it no further . after realizing they would n't budge , he tried to retreat through the door he 'd just passed . they 'll n't budge either . the teller engaged what is called a " man-trap , " basically a security system that locks would-be intruders between the two sets of doors leading outside where they remain caged until police can arrive and take them safely into custody , which detroit police soon did .
