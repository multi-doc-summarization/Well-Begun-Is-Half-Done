the diagnosis i have breast cancer , and the first bad cell split inside me , secretly , and it was over . she told me to wait five , eight , even ten years ago , the week reports . " i 'd became aware of a funny stiffness in a spot as i walk , sharing bits of one realm with the other . the morning i went in for my first mammogram , i felt nervous . i would tweet this new thing , like i do with lots of new things , and make the unknown and new feel less so . maybe by doing so , i thought while i was driving , other women like me who 'd never done this would also feel like it was less weird , less scary , more normal and worth doing without hesitation . i 'd crack some 140-character jokes . often , i move around in the world staring into a device on my own body . but anomalies in women 's bodies come and go all the time , maybe it 's me wanting to make my friend 's bad news all about me . i called my insurance company for a clinic referral , then dialed a few places on a list the guy in their indian call center emailed . over the phone , the clinics all sounded like places you 'd take a pork chop to be examined , not a lump , nothing that my waking , speaking mind would grasp as danger .
