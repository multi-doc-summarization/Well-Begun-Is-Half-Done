marco rubio and florida lt. gov . carlos lopez-cantera were at the scene of the orlando massacre on sunday when they had an unusually frank conversation about their political futures . " i don ’ t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure , " rubio responded . " and this isn ’ t about me . and it ’ s not about you . it 's about our country and this election . " lopez-cantera says he 's " m still running , " he says . " marco is running and you can talk about all the friendship stuff you want , but this shows marco is all . " rubio , who has been running for his senate seat in a crowded gop primary for more than a year , has been somewhere between staggering and absurd . " you can ’ t tell me this hasn ’ t been orchestrated , " says one republican who supports one of lopez-cantera 's rivals in the senate race said . " there is no plan , " lopez-cantera tells reporters . " it 's deeply consequential . … in the current field , i ’ m the best candidate in the general election . but i ’ ll have some time with my family . "
