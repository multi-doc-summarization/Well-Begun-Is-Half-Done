a european science satellite plunged back into earth 's atmosphere and incinerated with debris most likely landing in the southern regions of the atlantic ocean , officials say on monday . the last contact by ground tracking stations with europe 's gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer , known as goce , was at 5:42 p.m. est sunday ( 0016 gmt ) on sunday as the spacecraft flew just 75 miles above antarctica , the european space agency reports . " this would put the main area over which any possible goce remnants fell to the southernmost regions , " the space agency wrote in a status report . " no damage to property has been reported from any debris , " a report tells bbc . the mission was operating in an extremely low orbit , at 224km altitude , the lowest of any scientific satellite - and needed to constantly thrust an electric engine to stay aloft , but last month its reserves of xenon fuel were exhausted . goce was launched in 2009 to map variations in earth 's gravity . scientists assembled the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet 's crust and mantle waters of the southern ocean , east of new zealand .
