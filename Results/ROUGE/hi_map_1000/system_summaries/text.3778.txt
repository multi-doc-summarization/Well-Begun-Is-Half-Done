the discovery of the first goldilocks planet circling another star : just the right temperature to harbor alien life , the ap reports . the american team used a combined set of observations led by the observatory of geneva in switzerland had already discovered four planets circling gliese 581 by sorting out the subtle motions and the swiss group reported that he and his colleagues could find no reliable sign of a fifth planet in gliese 581 's habitable zone . they used only their own observations , but they expanded their published data set from what the u.s. group included in its analysis to a length of 6.5 years and 180 measurements . " i would expect that on the time scale of a year or two this should be settled , " he said . " it will be very interesting to see the harps paper , and how this shakes out . gliese 581g could still be there , it could be in the orbit reported , but this needs some more work . " astronomer , who notes , " we ca n't prove there is no fifth planet . " no one yet has the required precision in their observations to prove the absence of such a small exoplanet , he notes . astronomer , structure , and dynamical evolution just got underway in torino , italy ( good week to be in italy - meeting in sardinia also , wish i was there ) .
