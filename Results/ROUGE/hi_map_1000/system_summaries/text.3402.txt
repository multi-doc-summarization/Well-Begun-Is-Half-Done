president trump on tuesday fired fbi director james comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau 's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with russia in its interference in last year 's election . the bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through washington ends the career of the investigation , and even republicans were joining the call for independent inquiries , the ap reports . the white house has not said what precipitated the firing , a significant question because the justice department â€™ s stated reasons were well known even when mr. trump decided in january to keep mr. comey on the job . mr. comey is being investigated for his financial ties to russia and turkey . grand jury subpoenas are a routine part of federal investigations and are not a sign that charges are imminent . and it was not clear whether the subpoenas , first reported by cnn , who publicly recused himself from overseeing the russia investigation in march , " played a role in firing the man leading it. . " " why now ? why did it happen today ? " schumer asked , noting that if the clinton missteps were the true reason , the trump administration could have dismissed him in january .
