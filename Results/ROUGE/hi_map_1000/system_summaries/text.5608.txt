dennis herrera 's attempt to curtail monster beverage corp. from marketing its highly caffeinated energy drinks to minors is getting heated , with the company going to federal court to try to stop herrera 's investigation . in a lawsuit filed monday in los angeles , monster says herrera ’ s effort would “ impose undue burdens on interstate commerce ” and violate constitutionally protected “ commercial speech ” and other rights . the lawsuit also contends that “ ( herrera ) appears to be motivated by publicity rather than science. ” herrera has been investigating the corona ( riverside county ) -based maker of monster energy drinks since october under the state ’ s unfair competition law , targeting its marketing claims that the amount of caffeine in its products is " completely safe " and that consumers " can never get too much of a good thing ! " in march , herrera joined a group of 18 doctors from medical centers across the country in calling for the u.s. food and drug administration to regulate caffeine levels in energy drinks , saying the beverages pose health risks , particularly for youths . under current fda standards , caffeine in sodas can register no higher than about 71 milligrams per 12-oz . serving and are often sold in much larger quantities per can , according to the doctors 's letter . " i intend to litigate this case aggressively to reform their irresponsible marketing and business practices , which i believe clearly violate california ’ s consumer protection , " he said . " starbucks isn ’ t marketing sweet drinks that are highly caffeinated to young people . "
