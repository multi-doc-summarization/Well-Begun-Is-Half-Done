" we certainly do n't like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company , " he said . " the trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the united states and around the world and in some cases , such as his proposed ban on international travel for muslims , would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs . " in a statement to cnn that the rnc " never intended to use the ad space reserved with buzzfeed , " peretti says .
