donald trump , who was ahead of kasich by 33 points in new york history monday night , driving an adoring first niagara center crowd into a frenzy as he promised to revamp trade agreements , repeal obamacare and restore jobs to buffalo and elsewhere in the state . trump seemed to speak in overdrive , lambasting on 7-11 , down at the world trade center , right after it came down , and i saw the greatest people i ’ ve ever seen in action . " we ’ re going to be so strong , " he said . " that ’ s not your fault ; it 's the politicians representing all of us . " he added , " i don ’ t want to get more presidential until i win . " trump says he expected his campaign to soon retreat from some of the especially tough rhetoric he has used since announcing his candidacy in june . on monday , he continually cited the loss of buffalo ’ s diminished job base and its economic challenges . and as he has throughout his campaign , he blamed much of the malaise on “ stupid trade deals ” such as the north american free trade agreement .
