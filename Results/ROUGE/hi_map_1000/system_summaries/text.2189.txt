ted kennedy jr. will not run for john kerry 's senate seat in massachusetts , he announced in a statement monday . the actor took to his facebook page monday to say he 's not taking the plunge into elected politics , either . " i love massachusetts and our political process , but i am not running for office , " affleck wrote . " right now , it 's a privilege to spend my time working with eastern congo initiative ( eci ) , supporting our veterans , drawing attention to the great many who go hungry in the u.s. everyday and using filmmaking to entertain and foster discussion about issues like our relationship to iran . " politico notes that kennedy 's decision isn ’ t changed in the wake of ted kennedy ’ s decision , but that if he ’ d decided to run , the field certainly could have shrunk , given the amount of attention kennedy would have received . " the reality is if ted kennedy had gotten in , kennedys suck up a lot of political oxygen , " said democratic strategist scott ferson . " but i think he ’ s being thoughtful about it , he knows where he 's made his life and sees his future . "
