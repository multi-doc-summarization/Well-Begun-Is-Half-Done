patricia heaton , a georgetown university law student who was prevented from testifying in front of issa 's panel discussing the obama administration 's mandate that contraceptive care be offered to all employees free of charge , the ap reports . fox 's support for a missouri stem cell research bill by warning against the evils of human cloning and human egg harvesting are a useful indicator of what many conservative americans think . let ’ s look at the questions he raised . william saletan will saletan writes about politics , science , technology , and other stuff for slate . they are also humorless . treat them gently & do n't try to joke w/them . yeah , it 's our humorless nature that 's the problem . it 's not that heaton is armed with no facts , is passing judgments against others and bullying a college student for no other reason than her reproductive rights ? hey tweatons gal : plz let us also pay for your starbucks , movie theater tickets , and your favorite hot wings combo deal at kfc ! anything else ? more of heaton ’ s deleted tweets can be found on crooks & liars , angry black girl , and fanity . progressives are extremely sensitive and delicate , and she 's at it again , this set off a firestorm on twitter , one for which heaton may not have been prepared . i mean , really , how dare should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit ? in my monologue , i posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone 's bedroom .
