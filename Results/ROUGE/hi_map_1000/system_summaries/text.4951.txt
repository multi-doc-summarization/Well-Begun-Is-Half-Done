a ruling issued tuesday by the new jersey supreme court could cause more than 20,000 drunken driving convictions to be vacated . the justices unanimously found that criminal charges pending against a state police sergeant made breath-testing device test results from five counties inadmissible as evidence . sgt . marc dennis was in charge of calibrating the devices , and authorities have alleged that he skipped a required step in the calibration process . dennis has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to records tampering and other charges . the court vacated the conviction of a woman who pleaded guilty to drunken driving based on a result from one of those machines , and then died while waiting for the legal fight to finish . it also ordered state authorities to notify anyone whose case involved results from machines dennis calibrated . they must tell them that those results were not scientifically sound , so they can decide whether they want to go to court and seek to have their convictions vacated . they claim that omitting that one step did n't invalidate the results , noting new jersey is the only state that requires the step . the supreme court , though , sided with judge joseph lisa , who was appointed as a special master to handle the issue . he found the step omission raised substantial doubts about the reliability of the machines . as part of their decision , the justices called into question any test result involving a machine dennis handled , including devices used by local police in middlesex , monmouth , ocean , somerset , and union counties between 2008 and 2016 .
