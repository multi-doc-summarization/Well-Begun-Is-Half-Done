london 's transport authority said friday it wo n't renew uber 's license to operate in the british capital , arguing that it demonstrates a lack of corporate responsibility with implications in public safety and security . transport for london says the car-hailing app was not " fit and proper to hold a private hire operator license . " it cited its approach to handling serious criminal offenses and its use of software to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app , preventing " officials from undertaking regulator or law enforcement duties . " london mayor sadiq khan said he supported the decision , saying any operator of taxi services in the city " needs to play by the rules . " he says that " providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety , " he said . " the truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation . it ’ s critical that we act with integrity in everything we do , and learn how to be a better partner to every city we operate in . that doesn ’ t mean abandoning our principles – we will vigorously appeal tfl ’ s decision – but rather building trust through our actions and our behaviour . in doing so , we will show that uber is not just a really great product .
