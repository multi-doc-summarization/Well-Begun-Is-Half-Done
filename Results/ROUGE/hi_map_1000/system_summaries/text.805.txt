the european chess union has decided to lay out a dress code to keep the classiness in the game , reports the new york daily news . " many of the players were not wearing proper clothes , " she said . " i was here during three rounds and i 've got an impression that we have started to do something with dress code , and it 's very important for the image of chess . in fact these rules will be more useful during men events . on the other hand for many years i 've been in the chess world as a player , an arbiter , etc . once , when i said there were lot of comments . so , the question remains open â€“ i do n't know if we should do something about it or not . a combination of intelligence and beauty is very attractive advertisement in women chess . do n't you think that the rules , adopted by the ecu , which forbid the wearing of mini-skirts , can decrease the attention paid to women chess ? i have to admit that the players i saw here with short skirts looked very nice .
