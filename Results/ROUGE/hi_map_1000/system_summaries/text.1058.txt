" four suppressed rounds were fired . " bin laden , however , says the seals had been forced to climb stairs to arm and effectively defend himself . " only minutes after bin laden did not hear the seals ’ stealthy helicopter until it hovered over the roof of his three-story home and the chopper ’ s spinning blades smashed his plastic patio chairs against his bedroom window . in less than 10 seconds , as she tried to shield him , bin laden shoved his wife into the line of fire . it was the last thing he did . the first round went into the mattress door , they heard bin laden ’ s youngest wife screaming in arabic while raising a blanket to block their view . behind the rising blanket , he is known inside the intelligence community for his well-regarded first book , warrior soul , and inside hollywood for writing and producing movies including navy seals , hard target , and virus .
