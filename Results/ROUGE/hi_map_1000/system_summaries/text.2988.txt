eight people are trying to identify eight people whose badly decomposed remains were found on a wooden boat that washed up on a beach . the discovery took place in the northern akita prefecture , which is 450 miles from the shore , with what appeared to be cigarettes from the country and life jackets with korean lettering found nearby . the vessel was found by the japan coast guard on monday , just days after a group of men claiming to be from north korea were found 44 miles south of monday 's discovery , with their boat appearing to have run into trouble during what is a season of hostile weather . professor yoshihiko yamada , from japan 's tokai university , said : " during the summer , the sea of japan is quite calm . but it starts to get choppy when november comes . it gets dangerous when northwesterly winds start to blow . " in the latest incident , japanese police and the coast guard believe the two bodies could be down to food shortages in north korea , with smaller and older ships forced to sail beyond its coastal waters .
