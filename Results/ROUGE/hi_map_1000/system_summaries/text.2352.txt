" we ca n't carry on with diesel and petrol cars , " said david bailey , a professor of industrial strategy at aston business school . " that is why we are providing councils with new funding to accelerate development of local plans , as part of an ambitious £3bn programme to clean up dirty air around our roads. . " the bbc notes that the deadline is a " bit like saying we 're banning the sale of steam engines by 2040 , " says a government spokesman . " there is no alternative to embracing new technology . "
