it 's been a simple cramp , but it 's not clear whether it 's a good thing : " it felt like somebody literally just snapped my leg in half , " he said . " i heard it and i felt it , " american sprinter manteo mitchell told the associated press after breaking his leg on thursday . mitchell broke a bone in his left leg , usa today reports . mitchell 's split was 46.1 and the americans went on to finish in 2:58.87 to qualify for friday 's final . mitchell said on monday he was going up a set of stairs , missed one and landed poorly . " never thought that the phrase 'break a leg ' would reach reality for me lol , " she said , adding that he felt good warming up for thursday 's race . " it 's the smaller of the two bones that make up the lower leg , the other being the tibia . unlike the tibia , the fibula is non-weight-bearing . as such , it is possible to run on a broken fibula , very difficult , but not impossible . the americans will likely turn to one of their 400-meter hurdlers . angelo taylor , who was fifth in the 400 hurdles , ran in the 4x400-meter relay final at the world championships last year .
