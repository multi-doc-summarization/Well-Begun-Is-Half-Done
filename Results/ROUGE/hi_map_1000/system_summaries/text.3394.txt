a man stumbled across a roman villa in his back garden which is being hailed as the most significant discovery of its kind for a decade . luke irwin , from wiltshire , was laying an electricity cable in his barn when he uncovered a mosaic designer , and his wife had decided to convert an old barn on their newly purchased wiltshire property into a room where they and their children could play table tennis , so they hired electricians to lay cables for lights . " the electricians originally suggested stringing up an overhead cable from our house to supply the power for the barn , but i insisted it had to be an underground cable , " says irwin heritage archaeologist david roberts . " we knew the significance of that straight away . " irwin , a rug decision , was found in the centre of the old villa and rests on a large slab of purbeck and 220 , and had been remodelled several times before the fifth century . the team also discovered hundreds of discarded oyster shells were artificially cultivated and carried live from the coast in barrels of salty water .
