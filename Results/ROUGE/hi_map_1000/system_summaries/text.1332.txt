the australian study interviewed more than 500 men aged 18 to 72 , who were divided into facial hair categories , on their attitudes towards women . researchers found men with facial hair , scored higher on sexism than american men ( from clean shaven to sporting impressive beards ) , and facial hair was more likely to agree with hostile sexist statements . " men holding more patriarchal views may be inclined to reinforce their masculinity and dominance , " he writes . " furthermore , hostile sexist attitudes and nationality were the only significant predictors of whether or not men chose to grow than men with less sexist attitudes . " the researchers say that men who already hold sexist views may choose to grow out their beards between hirsuteness and sexism . " after controlling for nationality , age , level , relationship status , and support for statements such as â€œ women seek to gain power by getting control over men , " says one of the usa times . " it is suggested that sexist men choose to develop a significant role in perceptions of an array of sociosexual traits in men . "
