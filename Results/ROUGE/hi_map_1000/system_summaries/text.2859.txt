the mystery woman taylor swift shades in rolling stone ? " for years , i was never sure if we were friends or not . she would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away , and i would think , 'are we friends , or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life ? ' then last year , the other half was going , 'what if he just wants to walk around with a cat on his head , and not have his picture taken all day ? ' " she says . " she tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me . " " she did something so horrible , i think it 's really cool that you have that cat on your head . i think that 's interesting . ' " he said . " i ca n't be ungrateful , because i chose this . but sometimes – sometimes – you do n't want to have a camera pointed at you . sometimes it would be nice if someone just said , 'hey , we 're just straight-up enemies . ' and it was n't even about a guy ! " swift , who counts lena dunham and karlie kloss as bffs , continued , " it had to do with business . she basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour . "
