sen. elizabeth warren on tuesday called for a criminal investigation into wells fargo executives over the cross-selling scandal that has engulfed the bank and told ceo john stumpf he should resign . " this is about accountability , " she said . " you should resign , you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission . " as warren accused stumpf of " gutless leadership , " until then it will be business as usual , and at giant banks like wells fargo , that seems to mean cheating as many customers , investors and employees as they possibly can . " the only way that wall street will change is if executives face jail time when they preside over massive frauds , " he added . " they could end up in prison , but you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they could cheat customers and you could drive up the value of hyour stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your pocket . " it 's not clear whether the bank will help customers whose credit ratings have been hurt .
