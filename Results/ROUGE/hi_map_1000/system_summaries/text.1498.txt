president obama and mitt romney finally found something they could agree on during thursday night to break bread at the 67th annual alfred e. smith memorial foundation dinner , a white-tie charity fundraiser thrown by the catholic archdiocese of new york . " it 's traditional for both major party candidates to attend the benefit , perform a short stand-up routine , then pretend it is n't awkward to have dinner together during the most heated time in the campaign , " romney said . " i felt really well rested after the nice long nap i had in the first debate . " romney , sitting with his wife ann a couple seats down on the dais at the waldorf-astoria hotel , laughed . " a very impressive fellow , but he may be getting a little ahead of himself . i felt actually hoping the president would bring joe biden along this evening because he will laugh at anything. , " he says . " and i say , ‘ settle down , joe . i ’ m trying to run a cabinet meeting here. . " he added , " we were chatting pleasantly this evening as if tuesday night never happened . "
