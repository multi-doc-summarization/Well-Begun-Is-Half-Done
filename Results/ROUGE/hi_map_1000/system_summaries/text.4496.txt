the new york times book review , douglas brinkley—a historian who has published books about several presidents—wrote , “ call it chick nonfiction , if you will ; this book is not about politics , it ’ s about marriage , or at least one marriage , and a notably successful one at that . ” " it 's a serious , thoughtful book on the modern presidency in general . so no , i ’ m not going to call it ‘ chick nonfiction. ’ s the obamas is among people who had equal power in a marriage and one giving up the power , " politico reports . " it has been several years since the last time we did this . for this collection , several things were done : 1 . turned off duplicate detection . this collection will be complete , as there is a good chance we will share the data , and sharing data with pointers to random other collections , is a complex problem . 2 . for the first time , did all the different wikis . the original runs were just against the enwiki . but no review i ’ ve read went quite so far in questioning the book ’ s basic seriousness ( even while elsewhere appearing to take the book very seriously ) .
