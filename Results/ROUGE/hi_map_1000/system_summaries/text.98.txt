a personal trainer who tried to body-shame a woman for declining his services received a humbling dress-down on social media , the ap reports . a woman named cassie with how she looked , the conversation took an odd turn . the unnamed trainer began to shame her for not trying to " look her best " in her wedding photos . ugh , his misguided comments did not bring the bride-to-be down . she schooled him , and when she posted the screenshots on facebook last week , she added an important message : " you can accept how you look but you can ’ t be happy with the way you look . you are perpetuating the problem and i refuse to play that game . i reject your notion of operating on superficiality and looks , and i embrace my inner health goals. . " young politely : " i know it 's probably hard for you to understand this , but it ’ s taken me a long time to love my body . i ’ m sad for you that your self-worth is wrapped up in your appearance . you clearly place a lot of stock in looks but fail to understand that not everyone wants to be chained to that insecurity. .
