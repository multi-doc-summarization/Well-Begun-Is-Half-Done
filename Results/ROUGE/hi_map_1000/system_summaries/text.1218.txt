shaun white stood at the top of the halfpipe , the last contestant of the competition , needing a near-perfect run to capture his third consecutive gold medal at the winter olympics . he has built an empire on such moments . it felt too perfect , too scripted , even by the standards of storytelling that white has inspired . " for me to be remembered in the sport , i don ’ t think tonight makes or breaks my career , " he said . " i ’ ve been snowboarding for so long , and i love it so we can showcase snowboarding the way it needs to be showcased . not as a junk show , which is what it was looking like right now. . " davis called white ’ s fourth-place score " a gift " from the judges , and one former gold medal winner even suggested the event be pushed back . " it really felt like there was no fighting at all , " podladtchikov says . " especially in this event , with such a big crowd and the amount of media here . but , back to normal life , man. . "
