rescue crews are searching indonesian waters for airasia indonesia flight 8501 , which disappeared sunday with 162 passengers and crew onboard . the plane was in the safest part of flight : just 10 percent of fatal crashes from 2004 through 2013 occurred while a plane was at cruise elevation , according to a safety study published by boeing in august . passing through bad weather such as severe thunderstorms could have been ruled out . on tuesday , search teams will be checking the area where indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke , the head of search and rescue in the province of bangka-belitung told cnn indonesia . but authorities do n't know whether there 's any connection to the missing jet . local media in indonesia reported the smoke was seen on long island , one of thousands that make up the archipelago that forms indonesia . searchers say weather was probably a factor in the plane 's disappearance , and it has made finding traces of the plane more difficult . because there is a great deal of traffic along the water in the search area , authorities have cautioned that objects found might have nothing to do with the missing aircraft .
