a swedish doctor says four women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it 's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child . the women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants , using their own eggs to make embryos . " we have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready , " said dr. mats brannstrom , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of goteburg , who is leading the research . brannstrom 's technique is controversial because he is accepting wombs donated by living women , who are relatives or friends of his patients . elsewhere , wombs from dead donors have been used . brannstrom said any woman in the study who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy . the transplants are intended to benefit women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one . some doctors said women who got pregnant with a new uterus would have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy .
