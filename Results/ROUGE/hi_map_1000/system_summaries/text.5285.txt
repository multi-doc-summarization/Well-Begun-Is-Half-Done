president trump tried to claim wednesday morning that he knew republican roy moore , who he endorsed ahead of tuesday ’ s special senate election in alabama , would be unable to win because “ the deck was stacked against him ! ” moore was defeated tuesday night by doug jones , the first democrat from alabama elected to the senate in 25 years . moore , a former chief judge of alabama ’ s supreme court who was twice thrown off the bench for refusing to follow judicial orders , was accused during the campaign of sexually molesting and assaulting girls as young as 14 when he was a district attorney in his 30s . trump 's wednesday morning tweet followed one from the previous night , when he congratulated jones on a " hard fought victory . " " if last night ’ s election proved anything , it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate , " trump wrote on twitter . " i was right ! roy worked hard but the deck . " he added that he had been right all along about the race , because he had initially called on moore to drop his senate candidacy if the allegations were true , but wound up coming back into the republican candidate 's fold last week with a full-throated endorsement .
