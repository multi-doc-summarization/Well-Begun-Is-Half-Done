a student at mcgill university in canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question , how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the earth ? instead of the commonly accepted 42 minutes , he claims it is 38 . he has published his reasoning , math and conclusions in a paper published in the american journal of physics . if someone were to drill a hole as the center of the earth is approached then growing stronger and stronger as the person heads . " this is the kind of paper we love , " says david jackson , a physicist at dickinson college in carlisle , pennsylvania , and editor of the american association of physics teachers . the accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into account the constantly changing impact that gravity will have ( and ignoring drag due to the presence of air ) on the person falling you toward earth 's center varies in proportion to the falling man question , stating that it would in fact , take just 38 minutes ( and 11 seconds for long trips . the gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of isaac newton 's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical called the shell theorem .
