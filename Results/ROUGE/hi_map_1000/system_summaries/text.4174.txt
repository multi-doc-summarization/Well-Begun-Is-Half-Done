the british royal air force are sending a message to isis in a storied humanitarian situation , but it 's not clear when or where the bomb was ever dropped . " love from manchester ❤ , " it reads . " the responsibility of government is to minimise that chance [ of a terrorist attack ] , to ensure the police have the resources they need , that our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country , and that at home we never surrender the freedoms we have won , " he writes . " i know that isis holds civilian areas under siege , denying innocent families food , water and basic medical care . these besieged locations are the most difficult to work in , as it ’ s important that we are brave enough to recognise that something is not working in terms of our approach to military involvement abroad . " it 's " genuine " and " fake news " in the threat of manchester in britain , the new york times reports . " we want healing , not more violence and horror . the words written on the bomb are an unpleasant example of everything that ’ s wrong with our current approach to foreign policy and our penchant for funding chaotic conflicts that further destabilise countries and create the conditions ideal for extremism to flourish . it is the very embodiment of “ an eye for causing death and destruction , mere days after a terrible loss of life for frightened families who are just trying to survive in seeing children in other countries with their little ones dead in their arms , white with dust from collapsed buildings .
