donald trump 's hopes of delivering a " big surprise " at the republican national convention are officially rained out . tropical storm isaac had other plans however , as the threat of heavy rains and extreme winds forced the gop 's planning committee to postpone the rnc , shifting monday 's events and canceling others . trump spokesman michael cohen maintained that trump 's show would have been quite the spectacle . trump was in florida on sunday to receive a " statesman of the year " award from the sarasota gop . at a reception dinner , he addressed the development and also continued on his birther tear . " what we would want to do is define what president obama has done over the last four years , how and why he 's failed , and why his leadership has really failed the american people , " trump said . " you have to fight fire with fire . and if they do n't do it , they 're not going to have a good result . " trump also spoke on another contribution he has provided to the political debate : his near-constant appeal to beliefs that president barack obama was n't born in the united states , and that his long-form birth certificate is a forgery . pressed by reporters on an incident last week in which gop presidential candidate mitt romney appeared to make a joke about the nagging conspiracy theory , trump suggested it was no laughing matter . " i do n't think the republicans should be or can be , they ca n't afford to be politically correct and nice , " he said .
