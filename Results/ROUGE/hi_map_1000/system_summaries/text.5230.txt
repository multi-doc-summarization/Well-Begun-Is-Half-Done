steve douglass and dean muskett were taking photos at the rick husband amarillo international airport , reports the bbc . " we thought they were b-2s , but when we studied our pictures , we ruled that out . " douglass and his group , armed with cameras and binoculars , met on march 10 at the husband 's amarillo , reports foxnews.com . it was a clear day , and the group was alerted to three aircraft flying across the southwest skies . douglass estimated that the planes got within 20 miles of the group and they started taking pictures with their 300mm zoom cameras . they looked at the photos , and saw that one appeared to be a silver-grey b-2 bomber . the prospects of spotting a b-2 bomber was exciting , and douglass said he got home to observe his photos when he noticed the aircraft in his picture had a smooth backside . the report said that douglass picked up some apparently related voice signals , which would indicate the aircraft had a pilot . editors at aviation week reportedly say the images appear to be " something real . " " if i had to guess , i 'd say we took a picture of a stealthy transport aircraft , " he said . " it wasn â€™ t straight but had a slight curve , the aircraft was almost boomerang . "
