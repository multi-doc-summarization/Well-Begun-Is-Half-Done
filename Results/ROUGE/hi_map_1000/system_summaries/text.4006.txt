a local democratic state house candidate is crying foul after the michigan gop sent out campaign mailers republicans to call him at a number for his 91-year-old mother 's room at a portage-based nursing home . the number is registered under fisher 's name , and sent a statement which apologized for any distress that was caused , adding that it was n't their intention to have people call fisher 's mother . " when i dialed it , it came up on my cellphone , and it said , 'mom , ' " fisher said . " i 'm doing it in part to point out the lack of responsibility and thoughtfulness which is what i 'm running against . " " i do n't know how it could be underhanded to try to remind people not to call my mom , " fisher says . " to direct people to call a suffering woman who deserves peace and comfort is beyond the pale . " fisher 's campaign acknowledged it had no issue with past republican mailers county commissioner brandt iden and libertarian michael stampfler in a brief statement that he does not condone the tactics utilized by his party in this instance .
