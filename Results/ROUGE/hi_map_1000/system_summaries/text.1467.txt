former florida republican party chairman jim greer has filed a lawsuit against the party and the two officials in an attempt to collect $ 130,000 he was promised in a written agreement shortly before he resigned . the lawsuit , pending in leon county , is unlikely to be resolved until after a criminal trial scheduled for mid november , the ap reports . he blamed criminal fraud charges filed against him in 2010 on legislative leaders and other documents were released by statewide prosecutors wednesday . greer 's testimony offers a window into the level of animosity that exists between greer and the party he once ran . " i was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting . it had been one of those days , " he said . " legislative leaders were using their party credit cards like drunken sailors and they made it clear to me i was not to interfere with their spending , " greer says . " the party was in turmoil . there was a feeling within the party that the tea party was just a bunch of whack-a-dos . "
