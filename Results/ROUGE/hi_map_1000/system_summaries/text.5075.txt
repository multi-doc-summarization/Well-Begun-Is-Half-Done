two questions are enough to reveal the deep complexity of german actor klaus abused her as a child . pola said she had been abused between the ages of five and 19 by the actor , who died in 1991 after a career making some of germany 's most notable films .

" he was paying for me to be his little sex object , placed on silk cushions . " a biographer of klaus kinski , christian david , tells bbc , " it is obvious to viewers of kinski 's most important films that this madness is not acted , but a state that he could easily cross into . the films he made with werner herzog were particularly bleak journeys , and not just into the lost biographies of his heroes , all of whom were diabolical characters . they were also trips into the soul of his tortured lead actor -- and that is what gave his works such power . or a genius . or an insane genius , which is how we prefer our geniuses to be .
