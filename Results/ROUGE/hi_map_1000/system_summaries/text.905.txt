george lucas has apologized for criticizing disney 's handling of " star wars " and saying he had sold his characters to " white slavers . " it 's not clear what he meant , and rose did n't ask a follow-up question on his pbs show that aired dec. 24 , the ap reports . " they looked at the stories and they said , 'we want to make something for the fans , ' " lucas said . " i tried again two years later when i was 13 and got an agent to accept me with my name . you earned an oscar nomination soon after . how does that feel when you ’ re 19 ? for gilbert grape , yeah . and i absolutely didn ’ t know how to react to any of it . i remember coming out of a screening and somebody telling me how great they thought my performance was and that there was a potential for me to be nominated . i ’ d never heard anything like that before . it was like winning the lottery . do you ever think ‘ leo-mania ’ was too much too soon ? i ’ ve thought about that question a lot .
