the apollo program it took thousands of men and women to make nasa 's apollo program work , the ap reports . nasa 's first manned spaceflight program flew the mercury capsule , which was one of the most common questions posed to nasa 's astronauts : how do you go to the bathroom in space ? the answer is less sophisticated than you might expect and there was never a space age solution to the problem . rather , the galactic could be controlled by the astronaut , mission control , or by a flight plan pre-programmed into the capsule ’ s computer . the cabin was pressurized , too , with 100-percent oxygen and featured an environmental control system that removed odors , carbon dioxide , and moisture . pure oxygen also circulated through the astronauts ’ pressure suit with the same effects ; he stayed cool and dry because the oxygen flow promoted evaporation of his sweat . despite the high-tech capsule and clothing , there was one glaring oversight in the original mercury mission planning : there was no thought to the astronaut having to urinate during the flight . mcdonnell aircraft , the company who built the capsule , makes no mention of bathrooms of any kind in the nearly 500 page familiarization manual it sent to nasa . it wasn ’ t as if everyone just forgot astronauts are human and need to pee ; no one thought it was something worth addressing this early on in the space age .
