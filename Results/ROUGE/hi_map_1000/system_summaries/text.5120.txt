white house officials offered few details and no timeline for a possible attack on syria during a 90-minute conference call on thursday evening for members of congress , according to a congressional source who participated in the call . the administration officials made clear that its focus in syria was on " preventing [ president bashar ] al-assad from using chemical weapons again , " the ap reports . " the administration is figuring out the best way to do that and is seeking as much international support as possible , but wo n't let that dictate what our policy will be , " engel said . " tonight , i suggested that we should do so while un inspectors complete their work and allies to increase the military pressure on the assad regime by providing lethal aid to vetted elements of the syrian opposition , " he said , per the new york times . " as i have said before , no red line should have even been drawn without first preparing a strategic plan and assessing our resources , " a white house rep tells the bbc . " i do n't think the u.k. ought to have a veto on what the u.s. does or does n't do . "
