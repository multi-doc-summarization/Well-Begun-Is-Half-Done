the attack is like a " motorway jam " , but the bbc reports that the bbc has been slowed down in what security experts are describing as the biggest cyber-attack of its kind in history . a row between a spam-fighting group and hosting firm has sparked retaliation attacks affecting the wider internet . experts worry that the row could escalate to affect banking and email systems . five national cyber-police-forces are investigating the attacks . cyberbunker , a group based in both london and geneva , is a non-profit organisation that aims to help email providers filter out spam and other unwanted content . " if you aimed this at downing street they would be down instantly , " he said . " they worked themselves into that position by pretending to fight . " the bbc notes that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world . he claimed he was unable to disclose more details because the forces were concerned that they too may suffer attacks on their own infrastructure . the attackers have used a tactic known as distributed denial of service ( ddos content ) , which floods the intended target with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to render it unreachable . " it is essentially the phone book for the internet , " says a security researcher . " you can â€™ t stop a dns flood by shutting down those servers have to be open and public by default . the only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest . "
