a federal judge in manhattan on tuesday ordered the metropolitan transportation authority to display an ad from a pro-israel group on buses after the agency declined to run it last year . the group , the american freedom defense initiative , sued the authority in october , saying it had infringed on the group ’ s first amendment rights by rejecting the ad . the authority had argued that the ad could be seen as a call to violence against jews . the ad shows a man with a scarf across his face next to the words , “ killing jews is worship that draws us close to allah . " the ad was protected political speech under the first amendment and that a government agency can not refuse it based on unspecific fears that the ads would consider whether it would appeal the decision . " while the court is sensitive to the m.t.a. ’ s security concerns , the defendants have not presented any objective evidence that the ‘ killing jews advertisement would be likely to incite imminent violence , " judge koeltl said in the order . " that ’ s his jihad . what ’ s yours ? " both afdi and cair have courted controversy for years over advocacy that their critics say crosses the line to hatred .
