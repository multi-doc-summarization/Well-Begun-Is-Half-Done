pope francis has said that the roman catholic church should apologise to gay people for the way it has treated them . " i repeat what the catechism of the catholic church says : that they [ homosexuals ] should not be discriminated against , that they must be respected , accompanied pastorally , " he said . " the church must ask forgiveness for not behaving many times -- when i say the church , i mean christians ! the church is holy , we are sinners ! " he added , " if a person is gay and seeks god and has good will , who am i to judge ? ' " he says , " i think that the church not only should apologize to the person who is gay whom it has offended , " francis said , per the new york times . " there is something that is not working in that bulky union , but let 's not throw the baby out with the bath water , let 's try to jump-start things , to re-create . " pope francis said the church had no right to judge the gay community , and should show them respect . the pope was also asked whether christians bear some blame for hatred toward the lgbt community , as horrifically demonstrated in the orlando massacre at a gay night club that killed 49 people on june 12 .
