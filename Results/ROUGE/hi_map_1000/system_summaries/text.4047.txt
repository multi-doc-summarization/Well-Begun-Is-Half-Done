the trump administration will end billions of dollars in payments to insurers under the affordable care act program , but president trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care , according to people familiar with the matter on capitol hill and in the health-care industry . the white house in a statement thursday night said that based on guidance from the justice department , the department of health and human services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under obamacare . " if the short-term plans are able to siphon off the healthiest people , then the more highly regulated marketplaces may not be sustainable , " he said . " in light of this analysis , the government can not lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction . " trump tweeted the decision to scrap the subsidy payments , which are worth an estimated $ 7 billion this year and are paid out in monthly installments , also known as exchanges , where people can purchase plans , in many cases using government subsidies to offset the cost . it also required that plans offered on the exchanges include a specific set of benefits , including hospital care , maternity care and mental health services , and it prohibited insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions .
