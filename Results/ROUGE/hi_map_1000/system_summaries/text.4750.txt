it 's not clear that the movie is a " <unk> disaster simply because its dramatis personae are the most shameless bit of advertising-as-entertainment you could imagine , the nadir of hollywood 's intellectual-property dependence , and could n't possibly be worth seeing ? remember how incredibly wrong you were ? " " you were wrong then . given the right combination of inspiration , intelligence and gifted artists , any dumb thing can be turned into an enjoyable film . but tony leondis ' the emoji movie , a very , very dumb thing , comes nowhere near that magic combination . it is fast and colorful enough to attract young kids , but offers nearly nothing to their parents . if only this smartphone-centric dud , so happy to hawk real-world apps to its audience , could have done the same in its release strategy ' coming out via snapchat , where it would vanish shortly after arrival . but even that would n't be fast enough , " writes <unk> . at least two generations are a public-domain entity , but it 's a " soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor , wit , ideas , a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time , not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being .
