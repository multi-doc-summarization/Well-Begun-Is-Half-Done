president obama and his wife , michelle , met french president nicolas sarkozy and his supermodel wife , carla bruni , in strasbourg , france , as part of this weekend 's nato summit . everything seemed to be going swimmingly , in a french kind of way , outside the regal palais rohan . michelle and carla shared a warm embrace and a continental-style peck on each cheek , captured by hundreds of whirring paparazzi . but when bruni leaned in to kiss president obama , something happened . maybe he balked , perhaps imagining all the late-night fodder a picture of him smooching a fashion model might inspire . " oops , jill , i know this great podium where we can stand and watch the sun set , " he writes . " i kissed my best friend ’ s mom on the mouth by accident once . i initially felt very awkward , but when i said , ‘ oops ’ , we immediately both started laughing. ” if you both acknowledge that it was a <unk> handshake , sending the british press in particular into a spasm last night , when bruni and obama finally managed to seal their relationship with a polite double kiss .
