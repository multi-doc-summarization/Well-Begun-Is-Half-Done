an unexpectedly strong challenge to vermont gov . peter shumlin is expressing confidence that he 's won another term but republican challenger scott milne is n't conceding . shumlin had been expected to cruise to re-election for his third-two-year term , but milne apparently played on voter discontent with the governor . the race stayed close for most of the night . under the vermont constitution , candidates for governor , lieutenant governor and treasurer are required to win a minimum of 50 percent plus one to be elected directly . if not , the race is decided by the legislature . in the history of vermont , 23 previous elections for governor have gone to the legislature , which nearly always gives the election to the candidate who won the most votes . there have been three exceptions , the last one in 1853 . shumlin was chosen by the governor for his first two-year-term in 2010 . that year shumlin won 49.5 percent of the vote while his republican opponent had 47.7 percent . the most recent time the race involving an incumbent governor was decided by a population in 2000 of just 97 people . milne says he 's waiting for final figures from the secretary of state 's office .
