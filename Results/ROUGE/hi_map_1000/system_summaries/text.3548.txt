a spanish court ruled monday that a doctor stole a newborn child nearly five decades ago , one of the many abducted during spain 's 20th-century dictatorship , but cleared him because the statute of limitations had expired . eduardo vela , who worked as a gynaecologist at the san ramón clinic in madrid , had been accused of taking inés madrigal from her biological mother in the spring of 1969 and giving her to the 46-year-old woman who was falsely certified as her birth mother and who would raise her . prosecutors had sought an 11-year prison sentence for vela on charges of unlawful detention , falsifying official documents and handed the baby over to a couple who were not her parents . franco 's cruel legacy : the film that wants to stop spain forgetting read more however , they ruled that too much time had passed for a conviction since madrigal could not have been unlawfully detained once she became an adult and had only brought her complaint earlier because she only learned about the scheme in 2010 , when her adopting mother , who died three years later , disclosed the details of what had happened at vela 's clinic . dna tests confirmed the account , but madrigal 's biological parents were never found .
