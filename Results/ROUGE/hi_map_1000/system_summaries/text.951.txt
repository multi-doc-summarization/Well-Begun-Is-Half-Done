the men most likely to harass women online â€¦ are the men 's likely to have their own problems . that bit of validation comes courtesy of michael kasumovic and jeffrey kuznekoff , researchers at the university of new south wales and miami university , respectively , the ap reports . male players who were good at the game also tended to pay compliments to other male and female players . some male players , however , were more positive towards a female relative to a male teammate . as higher-skilled players have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization , we argue that a clearer understanding of sexist behaviour can be gained through an evolutionary perspective that considers evolved differences in intra-sexual competition . we show that lower-skilled males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status as a consequence of hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena . in other words , sexist dudes are literally losers . a chart from the halo study that shows how nice male gamers were to other males ( dotted line ) and females ( solid line ) during gameplay . men always treat each other about the same . but the better a player gets , the more likely he is to be nice to ladies .
