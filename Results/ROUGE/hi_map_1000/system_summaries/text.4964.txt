president obama and congress don ’ t strike a debt deal ? on aug. 3 , the nation would find out , with obama forced to make a set of extraordinarily difficult choices about what to pay or not pay . by then , the government ’ s savings account would be nearly empty and the president would be relying on daily tax revenue to pay the nation 's bills . " you can move the chess pieces around all you want , " says jay powell , a visiting scholar at the bipartisan policy center and an author of the university of maryland . if congress raises the debt ceiling without a long-term plan for reducing the federal deficit , he added , " they ’ ll never solve the problem , and we ’ ll end up like greece. . " " you would have to eliminate all other federal spending , including pay for veterans , members of the armed services and civil servants , as well as funding for pell grants , special-education programs , the federal courts , law enforcement , national nuclear programs and housing assistance , " he writes . " the government is to shed light on the operation of the debt limit in case congress does not raise the limit before the federal government runs short of cash and is no longer able to meet all of its obligations . in particular , we have addressed three questions : what is the date past which the government will be unable to honor all obligations ? if that date is passed without a debt limit increase , what will be no delay in the tough decisions .
