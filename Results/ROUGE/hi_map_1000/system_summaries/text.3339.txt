the storm was still a day away . evacuations were under way and people were just starting to arrive at the superdome . at his desk at the national weather service office in slidell , outside new orleans , meteorologist robert ricks knew he had a job to do . he knew he probably had one remaining chance . and so , using computers , history and his fellow forecasters , he sat down to write . " i happened to pull the trigger . it warned of a most powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength . it predicted : " most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks . perhaps longer . at least one half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure . all gabled roofs will fail . the vast majority of native trees will be snapped or uprooted . others will be totally defoliated . " perhaps most remarkably , ricks ' document predicted : you know , " hey , let 's gear up for the big one ; we just did n't think it was going to come this soon . it was the day before the storm . the images of devastation make it clear what happened . brian williams : did a part of you want to be like this , you did everything in your power to tell people a monster was coming , did the response break your heart ?
