its new photo app labelled two black people as " gorillas " by a new york-based software developer who was one of the most powerful companies on earth because it has developed some of the best algorithms in the world for organizing information . " google photos , y ’ all fucked up . my friend ’ s not a gorilla , " jacky google executive yonatan tells the bbc . " this is not the first time google photos has messed up in ways people have found offensive . " " we used to have a problem with people ( of all races ) being tagged as dogs , for similar reasons , " he said . " we ’ re also working on longer-term fixes around both linguistics ( words to be careful about in photos of people ) and image recognition itself ( e.g. , better recognition of dark-skinned faces ) . lots of work being done and lots still to be done , but we 're very much on it. . " the bbc notes that the app was brought to its attention by a black man as an ape , and concentration camp photos got tags like " jungle gym " and " sport . "
