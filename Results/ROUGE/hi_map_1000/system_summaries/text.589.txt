mitt romney 's first medicare plan to end the 46-year-old federal health program in its current form , the new york times reports . " we want to demonstrate that there is an emerging consensus developing on how to preserve medicare , " ryan tells the washington post . " people can go to bed knowing that traditional medicare will be there for them for all time. . " ryan and wyden are scheduled to release their proposal thursday morning at $ 8,000 that seniors would use to purchase private health plans . that proposal became a political lightning rod after it was released . democrats argued that republicans wanted to end medicare and said they would use the issue as a weapon against the gop in the 2012 elections . all of the republican candidates running for the white house have had to stake out positions on ryan 's plan . newt gingrich , the front-runner for the gop nomination , had to apologize to ryan after calling his budget " right-wing social engineering . " the new approach from ryan is a significant departure from ryan 's premium support plan , and their unusual alliance could complicate election-year politics for both parties on an explosive issue .
