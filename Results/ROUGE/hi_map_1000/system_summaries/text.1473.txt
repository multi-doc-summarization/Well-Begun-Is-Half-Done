the first experiment in charge of power can fundamentally change the way you speak , altering basic acoustic properties of the voice , and other people are able to pick up on these vocal cues to know who is really in charge , according to new research published in psychological science . the researchers had long been interested in non-language-related properties of speech , but it was former uk prime minister margaret thatcher that inspired them to investigate the relationship between acoustic cues and power . " it was quite well known that thatcher had gone through extensive voice coaching to exude a more authoritative , powerful persona , " says psychological scientist and lead researcher sei jin ko of san diego state university . " we wanted to explore how something so fundamental as power might elicit changes in the way a voice sounds , and how these situational vocal changes impact the way listeners perceive and behave toward the speakers. . " the researchers say the voices of students assigned to recall an experience in which they had power before the negotiation started . low-rank students , on the other hand , were told to imagine they had either a weak offer , no inside information , or low workplace status , or they were able to categorize whether a speaker had high or low rank with considerable accuracy .
