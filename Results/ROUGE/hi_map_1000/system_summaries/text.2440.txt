va scandal democrats can dismiss benghazi and the irs as pseudo-scandals , maybe , but 40 veterans have died , and where has obama been ? totally absent . up to now , president obama and congressional democrats had thought “ so-called ” scandals involving benghazi , the irs , and operation fast and furious were largely behind them . republicans have accused the obama administration of so many faux scandals that it ’ s hard to recognize the real thing . yes , the internal revenue service seems to have endless amounts of time to talk about the miseries of those living on the minimum wage , obama ’ s seeming indifference to the severity of the problems faced by our returning veterans seeking care at va facilities is shocking . dionne and katrina vanden heuvel explain why the left should look forward to this year . for progressives , a year on from chairman miller ’ s letter , the revelations of substandard care , neglect , and waste seem to have magnified , rather than been reduced . for a president who seems to see , just republican witch hunts designed to embarrass the president and perhaps land blows against hillary clinton .
