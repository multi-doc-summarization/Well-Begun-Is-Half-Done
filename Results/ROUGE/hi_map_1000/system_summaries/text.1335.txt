india 's government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat , eggs and lusty thoughts . doctors say the advice is preposterous , and even dangerous , considering india 's already-poor record with maternal health . women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally patriarchal indian households . malnutrition and anemia , or iron deficiency , are key factors behind india 's having one of the world 's highest rates of maternal mortality , with 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulting in the mother 's death in 2015 . that 's better than five years earlier , when the maternal mortality rate was 205 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births , but still far worse than china 's 27 per 100,000 or the united states ' 14 per 100,000 , according to unicef . " the government is doling out unscientific and irrational advice , instead of ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious , high-protein diet , " said gynecologist of religious dogma and ignores widely accepted medical evidence that pregnant women benefit from eating protein-rich meats and can safely engage in sex , doctors said . it says pregnant women should also shun " impure thoughts " and look at pictures of beautiful babies to benefit the fetus . " pregnant women must stay away from desire , anger , attachment , hatredness and lustâ€¦ ( sic ) , " senior gynaecologist and obstetrician malavika sabharwal of the apollo healthcare group . as for sex , if the pregnancy is normal , there is no need for abstinence as the baby in the womb is protected by the amniotic fluid and the uterus muscles .
