at least 60 people over the past four years in california have suffered mercury poisoning from using skin creams that were brought from mexico , according to the california department of public health , which is advising consumers to avoid using the products . the public health advisory issued thursday includes creams that are used for lightening skin , fading freckles and blemishes , and treating acne . the creams , which are often light in color and turn dark after prolonged exposure to sunlight , usually come in plain containers either without labels or with handmade labels . analyses of some creams have found mercury levels 200,000 times the california legal limit , and doctors believe the baby was exposed from contact with the mother or household items . in another case last year , a 16-year-old boy who used a cream for his acne was treated in a pediatric intensive care unit for almost a month for mercury poisoning . symptoms of mercury poisoning in adults include difficulty concentrating , irritability , insomnia loss and fatigue . children may have excessive thirst in another country and brought them back to the u.s. for personal use , he adds . if the ingredients aren ’ t listed and there is no product label , don ’ t assume it 's fine . federal law requires that ingredients be listed on the label of any cosmetic or nonprescription drug , so do not use a product that doesn ’ t have a label .
