a new study suggests that many published psychology results ca n't be recreated . researchers say that the studies were wrong in the first place , but it found that only 39 of those studies ' results could be replicated . " the results present an opportunity , and the project is a demonstration of science demonstrating one of its central qualities : self-correction , " a university of virginia researcher and the study 's corresponding author , tells reporters this week . " i don â€™ t see this story as negative or pessimistic , " brian nosek tells the journal science . " that self-correction even extended to the 39 studies that researchers were able to replicate . of those , 83 percent had smaller effects that were in the initial reports ; the drop in effect size was usually around 50 percent . the report being published today speaks to why a bigger focus on reproducibility is necessary . " researchers say it 's possible that the researchers failed to detect a real effect in the reproduction . finally , it 's also simply to make scientific findings more trustworthy . that 's not clear whether scientists have generally pushed toward reproducing studies , but they did not have been replicated or may have changed .
