the french parliament has approved a controversial law strengthening the intelligence services , with the aim of preventing islamist attacks . the law on intelligence-gathering , adopted by 438 votes to 86 , was drafted after three days of attacks in paris in january , in which 17 people died . the socialist government says the law is needed to take account of changes in communications technology . but critics say it is a dangerous extension of mass surveillance . they argue that it gives too much power to the state and threatens the independence of the digital economy . " representatives of the french people have given the prime minister the power to undertake massive and limitless surveillance of the population , " he said . " this is not going to be run on a predictive basis , we simply aim to ensure enhanced monitoring of those identified as threats. . " the bill will now go up before the new powers have instead kept quiet . in the wake of the bill , private residences can be monitored using geo-location measures , mobile communications can be intercepted with the us patriot act passed a month after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks .
