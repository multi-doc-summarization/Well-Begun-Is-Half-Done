the german newspaper that first obtained the so-called panama papers , a vast trove of documents on offshore companies , said thursday that it wo n't publish all the files , arguing that not all are of public interest . sueddeutsche zeitung received the documents from an unidentified source more than a year ago and shared at least parts of them with dozens of other media outlets around the world . since the first reports were published sunday , prominent politicians , showing it helped some clients evade tax and avoid sanctions . several countries are probing possible financial crimes by the rich and powerful in the aftermath of the leak . president juan carlos varela said panama would work with other countries over the revelations . " that gives a sense of the tremendous scope of this in terms of the flows of money into these largely mysterious companies , and this is only one firm , " says nicholas shaxson , an investigative journalist and author of treasure islands : tax havens and the men who stole the world , per the ap . " the panamanian would take their business elsewhere , " he said . " we learn from the leak will merely be embarrassing for those exposedâ€”showing them to be opportunistic and perhaps unethical , but not criminal . and that is why many of the people named in the panama papers will turn out to be illegal .
