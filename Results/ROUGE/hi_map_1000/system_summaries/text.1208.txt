coca-cola is dropping a controversial ingredient from its powerade sports drink , after a similar move by a mississippi teenager , who questioned why it was being used in a drink marketed toward health-conscious athletes . the petition on change.org noted that the ingredient is linked to a flame retardant and is not approved for use in japan or the european union . in response to customer feedback , pepsico said last year it would drop the ingredient from the two flavors of powerade that contain it as well . but this week , bottles of powerade in fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors being sold in the detroit , michigan ; omaha , nebraska , new york and washington , d.c. areas no longer list the ingredient . some bottles still list it , however , suggesting coca-cola co. may have started phasing it out recently . a couple months ago , i found out that this " bvo " is a controversial flame retardant chemical that is in some gatorade drinks ! who wants to drink that ? not me ! i â€™ m naturally a curious and argumentative person doing things like debate team in school . i also love sports like volleyball , and i always believed gatorade when they said stuff in their ads about how it 's good to drink when exercising . and , just like most people , i care about my health . so , as i was sitting at home the other day drinking an orange gatorade , i decided to look up some of the ingredients .
