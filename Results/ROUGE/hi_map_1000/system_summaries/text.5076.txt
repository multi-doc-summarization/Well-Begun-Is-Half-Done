the protective mechanism for an electronic device is falling and how it may impact a surface on its edge , rather than on a screen portion , the new york times reports . according to the website , apple 's " protective mechanism is configured " to the us patent and trademark office , which the patent application is configured . " the system does not appear to be close to going into production , and leaks about such a seemingly fanciful system is unlikely to be integrated to any electronic device with a processor , from a tablet to a laptop , it is most well-suited for those portables , accelerometers or position sensors , but the patent also mentions more sophisticated equipment such as gps and imaging sensors may be employed , " writes <unk> <unk> at the washington post . " it is positioned relative to the ground , and a thrust mechanism such as a small gas-propulsion device . other methods mentioned look to counter the problem of a device being pulled onto the floor by a trailing power or headphone power supplies . " " the patent explores the possibility that cables could be forcibly ejected when rapid movement is detected to prevent the device to avoid damage . the system must then - and this is the really difficult part - reorientate the device in mid-air so it lands as flat as possible . here , the system needs a sensor or sensor array that can detect when a device is in a freefall state . if such a determination is made , how far away it is from the ground and time to impact , among other metrics . statistics of various fall heights , speeds and other data can
