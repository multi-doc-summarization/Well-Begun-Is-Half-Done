two connecticut college student researchers found that we actually have 30 seconds to pick up dry foods before they 're contaminated with bacteria . apparently we have more time than we thought when it comes to retrieving and eating food that has been dropped on the floor , a favorite topic among julie 's health club readers . the students set out to challenge previous research on the topic by jillian clarke of chicago high school for agricultural sciences , who tested the theory several years ago for a college internship by dropping food items directly onto e-coli contaminated tiles . " the kitchen floor , however , is probably a zero-second zone because the bacteria from uncooked meat and chicken juices are more hazardous than the ‘ soil ’ bacteria outside , " says connecticut college 's molly goettsche . " we did this as a creative inquiry project to learn how research is done . that is , research begins with a simple idea or a question , experiment is then set up to test this idea or question , data is collected , and finally a conclusion is drawn based on what the data showed us about that original question . in the case of the five-second-rule we found that bacteria was transferred from tabletops and floors to the food within five seconds , that is the five second rule is not an accurate guide .
