anthony weiner 's twitter account to a woman college student says he has an x-rated picture of the worst couple of weeks in rep. weiner 's life continues . andrew breitbart appeared on the opie and anthony show on sirius radio this morning in the latest stop on his “ i told you so ” tour and showed the hosts , anthony cumia and gregg “ opie ” hughes a picture that he said he wouldn ’ t release ; a fully uncensored photo that purports to be enough to put the final nail in the coffin . one interesting detail is that this image will not be allowed on television which means people , in all of their curiosity , will look it up online , making them more actively involved in the story . that ’ s something that could affect how strongly they feel about weiner and the scandal either way . whatever the case , this is not a good development for rep. weiner . so , yeah , the picture ’ s out there now . it will be interesting to see how much this picture affects the story , reports the washington post .
