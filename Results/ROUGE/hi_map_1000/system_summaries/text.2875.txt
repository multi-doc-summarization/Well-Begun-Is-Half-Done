a judge planned to announce his verdict sunday in the case of two high school football players charged with raping a 16-year-old girl after an alcohol-fueled party last summer . prosecutors say the drunken girl was taken advantage of and treated like a toy . defense attorneys counter that the boys put her clothes on a table , but she woke up the next morning in the basement living room of another house . she was naked , she recalled , with no idea how she got there or where she was , and mr. mays , mr. richmond and another boy were surrounding her . " i was embarrassed and scared , and i did not know what to think because i could not remember anything , " she testified . she said that over the next two days she pieced together what had happened with the help of friends who showed her a video posted on youtube and a picture that had circulated of her in the back seat of a car , while another student testified that the girl was not likely to have consumed enough alcohol to pass out that night but that she did drink enough to have a memory lapse , implying she could have consented to having sex but did not remember doing so .
