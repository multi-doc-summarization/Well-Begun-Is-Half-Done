the biggest failure in american soccer history is as complex as it is damaging . there is plenty of blame to go around , including to a phantom goal that helped panama jump the americans in the standings , but the brunt of it should and will be placed on the players and coaches who underperformed for the better part of a year of concacaf qualifying play . the loss is devastating to the us men 's soccer program , which had not missed a world cup since 1986 . but some executives at fox sports are surely just as upset with the result as coach bruce arena and his players . to win a bidding war with espn , fox agreed to pay $ 400 million for the english-broadcast rights to the world cup in 2018 and 2022 . and they lost , a deserving defeat that ended a miserable qualifying campaign—three wins in 10 hexagonal games—and will raise enormous questions about the overall direction of the u.s. soccer federation , which was exactly what happened . honduras rallied from two deficits to beat mexico in san pedro sula , while panama rode a controversial blas perez opener .
