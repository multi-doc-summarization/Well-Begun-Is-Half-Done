microsoft is buying nokia 's cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio , according to both companies . in 2003 , nokia 's acquisition of nokia is aimed at building a devices and services company , away from the services business it has traditionally been , for several years now with limited success . through the smoke and heat , he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform 's edge . when he looked down over the edge , all he could see were the dark , cold , foreboding atlantic waters . " with the consumerisation of it user matter at both home and work ... we can not risk having apple or google foreclose app innovation , integration , suppliers and from you . today , i 'm going to share what i 've learned and what i have come to believe . i have learned that we are standing on a burning platform . and , we have more than nokia , " he said . " i 've shared with you what i do heard from our shareholders , operators , developers , distribution or economics . " nokia 's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008 , the same year microsoft decided , internally at least , to scrap its ancient and inadequate windows mobile platform in favor of something entirely new . under these circumstances , it 's easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time , or at least a mutual sympathy .
