a small boy , locked in a caged bed in a residential institution , was a black-and-white photograph in a newspaper . his hands clutched what appeared to be chicken wire containing him , and his expression was agonised . " how could that happen , " they ask . " i have met children so desperate for affection that they will crawl into any stranger 's lap . damage is done very early , and it is lasting . cut off from society , institutionalised children return to the world with their chances of a happy , healthy life greatly impaired , often unable to find employment , excluded from the community and more likely to enter into a lifetime of poverty and dependency . a crucial point is that these dire effects apply to children from all kinds of institutions , disability and discrimination . the impact of not having the love and attention of a dedicated carer is profound . it can cause stunting , developmental delays and psychological trauma . the solution is no institutions . the good news is that this is an entirely solvable problem . based on the successes already achieved in several countries , lumos estimates that the institutionalisation of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 .
