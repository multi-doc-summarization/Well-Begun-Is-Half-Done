mayor dario nardella announced the initiative on wednesday morning , and at lunchtime the first cleanings took place . " from today , we 'll be experimenting with a very simple measure : pouring water over the church steps to clean the spaces , and hopefully discourage people from eating , drinking and making a mess there , " nardella tells the guardian . " if tourists want to sit there , they 'll get wet , " he said . " florence is full of cafes with outdoor seating , tables , and benches . but there has been an increase among those who don ’ t respect our cultural heritage , who sit down on church steps , eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on the steps . " the first places to get the treatment were the first to be hosed down , taking place at about lunchtime , in targeting those who choose to eat takeaway food rather than at pricey restaurants . " we want to put people off from camping out . if they sit down , they ’ ll get wet . instead of imposing fines , we thought this measure was more . "
