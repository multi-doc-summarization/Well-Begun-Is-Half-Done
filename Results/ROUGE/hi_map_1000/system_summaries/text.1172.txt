texas sen. ted cruz took to the senate floor on thursday to urge his republican colleagues to vote against attorney general nominee loretta lynch . when the final confirmation vote came a few hours later , cruz — a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination— skipped the vote . cruz 's communications direction amanda carpenter did not provide a reason for the senator 's absence but said in an emailed statement that she had " embraced the lawlessness and laws after he was confirmed as attorney general . " he voted against her in committee and opposed cloture . that is why he spoke on the floor about it , has given numerous interviews , and written an op-ed the topic . cruz missed the vote because he had to fly home to texas for a fundraiser . " i wanted to see a new attorney general who would be faithful to law , but the republican majority has chosen to go forward and allow loretta lynch to be confirmed , " he said . " in my view , no senator can vote for this confirmation consistent with his or her oath. . " cruz was the only member of the chamber not to vote . he did participate on a procedural vote earlier , opposing clearing the path for final confirmation .
