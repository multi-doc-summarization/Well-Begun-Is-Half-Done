the military operation to wrest mosul from the islamic state group could potentially become the single largest , most complex humanitarian operation in the world in 2016 , a u.n. official tells the guardian . " everyone is staying at home because we don ’ t know what else to do . daesh [ another name for islamic state ] are mostly moving around on motorbike and have small and heavy guns , " he said . " we have seen too many beheadings , people being drowned in cages , thrown from top of buildings ... i myself saw a man thrown off a building near the governor ’ s office around three months ago . i begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me as the house could be targeted by coalition . he refused and said : ‘ whatever destiny brings. ' . " iraq 's second largest city , fell to 1.5 million civilians inside mosul who may get caught in the fighting , says she has heard reports of people charging as much as $ 10,000 to smuggle people out of mosul ahead of the operation to retake the city that was launched monday . " our capacity to support 700,000 people in the short-term , we could n't do it . and certainly if we had to mount a response over the intermediate-term , if they could n't go back to mosul quickly , if there was too much damage in the city , then it would test us to the breaking point , " grande said .
