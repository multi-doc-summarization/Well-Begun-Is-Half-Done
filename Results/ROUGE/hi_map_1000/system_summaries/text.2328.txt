a criminal court judge in manhattan ruled on monday that twitter must turn over to prosecutors messages sent by a brooklyn writer during the occupy wall street protests last fall . in doing so , the judge , matthew a. sciarrino jr. , indicated that although private speech was protected , the same did not apply to public comments on twitter . " the constitution gives you the right to post , but as numerous people have learned , there are still consequences for your public posts , " judge sciarrino wrote . " what you keep to yourself belongs only to you. . " twitter 's office subpoenaed all messages that he had posted to twitter from two days before the wall protests charged with disorderly conduct , a violation of the brooklyn district attorney 's office won a court ruling forcing twitter to turn over three months â€™ worth of tweets for their information , unless barred by a statute or a court order ; in the decision released on monday , judge sciarrino dismissed the motion in april , writing that prosecutors should be required to obtain a search warrant from a judge for each request and that the person whose posts were being sought should have an opportunity to oppose the demand in court .
