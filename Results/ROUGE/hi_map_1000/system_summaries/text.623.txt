los angeles unified school district campuses will reopen wednesday , officials announced , following an unprecedented districtwide closure tuesday after the lausd received a threat of violence and weapons , and stated that " things were already in place to bring that violence about . " early on in the investigation , the city 's emergency operation center was activated at its lowest level , the ap reports . " when parents make their determination about the decisions that were made today , " he said . " i would ask them to look at it this way : if you knew what the superintendent and the school board knew at 5:30 this morning , when the decision had to be made , would you have sent your child to school . " the threat against the nation 's second-largest school district was sent via email to a school board member monday evening and was traced back to an ip address in frankfurt , germany , according to lausd spokeswoman ellen morgan . officials announced the la email came from a “ pornographic ” address . " if there 's anything like that is ever even a potential threat , i would want them to cancel all schools , " she says . " we 're nearly 100 percent certain that we can take the steps to restore those funds to the district . "
