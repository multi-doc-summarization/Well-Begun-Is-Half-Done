researchers have decoded the genome of the coelacanth , a prehistoric-looking fish whose form closely resembles those seen in the fossils of 400 million years ago , until a specimen was recognized in a fish market in south africa in 1938 , the bbc reports . the coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods , meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants , from reptiles and birds to mammals . the decoding of the water-to-land genome , reported online wednesday in the journal nature , is a victory for the lungfish as the closer relative to the first tetrapod . but the coelacanth may have the last laugh because its genome â€” which , they produce extremely large eggs , with a good blood supply , that hatch inside the mother 's body . this gene could have been developed by land animals into a way of constructing the placenta . another helpful preadaptation is a snippet of dna that enhances the activity of the genes that drive the formation of limbs in the embryo .
