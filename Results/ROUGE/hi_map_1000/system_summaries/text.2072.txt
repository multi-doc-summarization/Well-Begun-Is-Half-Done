the melting of antarctica is accelerating at an alarming rate , with about 3 trillion tons of ice disappearing since 1992 , an international team of ice experts said in a new study . in the last quarter century , the southern-most continent 's ice sheet — a key indicator of climate change — melted into enough water to cover texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet ( 4 meters ) , scientists calculated . all that water made global oceans rise about three-tenths of an inch ( 7.6 billion metric tons ) . from 2012 to 2017 , the melt rate increased to more than 241 billion tons a year ( 219 billion metric to 2011 . these spacecraft can tell how much ice is present by measuring changes in the height of the ice sheet and the speed at which it moves towards the sea . " we ca n't say when it started - we did n't collect measurements in the sea back then , " said university of california irvine 's isabella velicogna , one of 88 co-authors . " things are happening . they are happening faster than we expected . " part of west antarctica , where most of the melting occurred , " is in a state of collapse , " co-author ian joughin of the university of washington .
