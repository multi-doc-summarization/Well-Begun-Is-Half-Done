iran is probably a year away from having enough enriched uranium to build a nuclear bomb in as little as a month , according to a new estimate by one of the usa 's top nuclear experts . the new assessment comes as the white house invited senate staffers to a briefing on negotiations with iran as it is trying to persuade congress not to go ahead with a bill to stiffen sanctions against iran . " tehran is ready to convert its stockpile of 20 percent-enriched uranium to fuel rods and remove concerns over its non-peaceful use , " hosseini was quoted as saying . " i have never had such intense , detailed , straightforward , candid conversations with the iranian delegation before , " he said . " an essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further . " hosseini , a former inspector for the u.n. parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , says the estimate means that iran would have to eliminate more than half of its 19,000 centrifuges to extend the time it would take to build an atomic bomb . iran says its program is peaceful and is for advances in medical research and power generation .
