ryan fry , chris schille , and dj kidby was kicked out of the red deer curling classic on sunday for " unacceptable behaviour " that included being " extremely drunk . " the four were ejected from the world curling tour event and forced to forfeit their final match . " they went out to curl and they were extremely drunk and breaking brooms and swearing and just unacceptable behaviour that nobody wants to watch or listen to and it was just 'enough was enough , ' " facility manager wade thurber tells canadian broadcaster cbc . " we had people taking pictures of the sign and also lots of people telling us we did the right thing . when you have people complaining like that , there is a need to do something , right ? " " we did that because we had so many complaints from other players and teams , not to mention the spectators , and so we wanted them to know that we did something about it , " he said . " i will strive to become a better version of myself while contributing positively to the sport and curling community that i love so much . "
