it 's a good time for the first time : the researchers spotted an extremely large , bright nebula of gas , extending 2 million light-years across intergalactic space , exactly as predicted by theory . the team of astronomers , led by researchers at the university of california , santa cruz , found a distant quasar ( hyperactive galaxies ) that was illuminating in a cosmic web of " stuff " , most of which is dark matter . astronomers of the work appear in the journal nature . " this is a very exceptional object : it â€™ s huge , at least twice as large as any nebula detected before , and it extends well beyond the galactic environment of the quasar , " posited first author sebastiano cantalupo , a postdoctoral fellow at uc santa cruz . the quasar illuminates a nearby gas cloud measuring two million light-years away . in this case we were lucky that the flashlight is pointing toward the nebula and making the gas glow sebastiano <unk> , university , and the glowing gas appears to trace out filaments away , shines light in just the right direction to reveal the cold gas cloud . for some years , cosmologists have been running computer simulations of the structure of the universe and the development of galaxies such as our own milky way by unraveling the secrets of the cosmic web .
