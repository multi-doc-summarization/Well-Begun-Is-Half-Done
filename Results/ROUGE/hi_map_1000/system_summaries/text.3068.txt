the arizona legislature gave final approval thursday evening to legislation that allows business owners , as long as they assert their religious beliefs , to deny service to gay and lesbian customers . the bill , which the state house of representatives passed by a 33-27 vote thursday , now goes to gov . they frequently cited the case of a new mexico photographer who was sued after refusing to take wedding pictures of a gay couple and said arizona needs a law to protect people in the state from heavy-handed actions by courts and law enforcement . republicans stressed that the bill is about protecting religious freedom and not discrimination . " i think anybody that owns a business can choose who they work with or who they do n't work with , " brewer told cnn in washington on friday . " but i do n't know that it needs to be statutory . in my life and in my businesses , if i 've n't want to deal with a particular company or person or whatever , i 'm not interested . that 's freedom . " as expected , the measure has drawn criticism from democrats and business groups who said it would sanction discrimination and open the state to the risk of damaging litigation .
