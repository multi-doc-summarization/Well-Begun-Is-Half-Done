madonna has been acting like madonna performing a striptease during each of the shows on her mdna tour , so it 's unsurprising that she got down to the bare essentials at a concert in hyde park , the ap reports . madonna was set to announce summer dates for melbourne and sydney on july 12 , but postponed the announcement until after the london olympics . stadiums in sydney and melbourne had been booked for her new show , mdna , in january and february . earlier this year , oseary said : " we 'll get to these markets where she 's never been , some exciting new places , and get back to australia after too long a time . " " madonna really needs to go to australia . we are long overdue for a trip down under and apologise for that . it will happen , " he said . " we pay our respects to those who survived and those who perished in the uprising . we won â€™ t allow the desecration of our hallowed symbols. . " madonna 's hyde park concert was cut off after he was 13 because her then-boyfriend took her out for pizza . but these days , it 's a place with a summer-camp vibe , thanks to the fact that the campus is crawling with actors and creative types . the tour , which is in support of the album by the same drug-pun name , may end up being the highest-grossing concert run of all time .
