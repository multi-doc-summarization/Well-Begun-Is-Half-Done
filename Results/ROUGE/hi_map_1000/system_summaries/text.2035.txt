a missouri appeals court judge was appointed monday to take over ferguson 's municipal court and make " needed reforms " after a highly critical u.s. department of justice report that was prompted by the fatal police shooting of michael brown . the missouri supreme court said it is assigning state appeals judge roy l. richter to hear all of ferguson 's pending and future municipal court cases , reports the ap . " extraordinary action is warranted in ferguson , but the court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis , " chief justice mary russell said in a written statement . " judge richter will bring a fresh , disinterested perspective to this court 's practices , and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms . " the ap notes that ferguson was counting on revenues from fines and fees to generate $ 3.1 million , or nearly one-quarter of its total $ 13.3 million budget for the 2015 fiscal year . although it was rare for the court to sentence people to jail as a penalty for city code violations , the justice department report said the city 's court almost always imposes monetary penalties and then issues arrest warrants when people fail to pay on time or miss a court date .
