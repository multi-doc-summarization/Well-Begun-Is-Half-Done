people living within about 20 miles of a small-scale nuclear attack have up to half an hour to seek out adequate shelter safely , as long as travel time to that shelter is no more than 15 minutes away . " the principle is trying to figure out the least amount of information you need to make your decisions as fast as possible , " dillon told livescience . " in these sorts of situations , you do n't have a lot of time , and you ’ produce harmful radioactive fallout that residents must avoid to reduce the nauseating effects of radiation poisoning and longer-term individuals from fatal exposure in the fallout phase of the emergency , the study said . [ the top 10 largest explosions ever ] the best way to protect against the radioactive dust and ash of nuclear fallout is to seek shelter underground , since the fallout can largely be rinsed off once a person seeks refuge . the only thing a person really needs , dillon half-joked , is a good pair of sneakers that allows them to travel quickly , if they are traveling by foot . if traveling by car , people must take traffic into consideration when planning their escape strategies , dillon said , pointing out that his results provide only one piece of a larger response strategy that can become more complicated by unpredictable factors such as traffic flow . dillon is working to assess the distribution of shelter that one has immediate access to at the time of an attack . to help simplify this decision process , michael dillon of the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california , has now come up with a mathematical model for the “ optimal shelter exit time ”
