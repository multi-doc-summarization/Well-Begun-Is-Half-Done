donald trump says that as president he would end " our current strategy of nation-building and regime change " because they do n't work . his dislike for nation-building is shared by many , including none other than the target of his criticism , president barack obama . in fact it was obama 's predecessor , republican george w. bush , who committed the u.s. to large-scale nation-building projects in iraq and afghanistan . obama discarded that strategy while trying to keep enough u.s. influence there to prevent those two countries from crumbling . obama 's approach may not have worked , but it 's not bush-like " nation-building . " and while the republican presidential nominee argued against nation-building in a foreign policy speech monday , he advocated for something even more grandiose : seizing iraq 's oil wealth in the aftermath of the u.s. invasion in 2003 that toppled saddam hussein . " the problem , people familiar with the immigration system say , is that many of trump 's ideas will be nearly impossible to implement . and some may wind up actually increasing the terrorist threat , " he said . " we should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people . i call it extreme vetting . "
