rush limbaugh responded to a couple of my email questions on air about why he 's now urging listeners to call congress over health care legislation . it 's an unusual move for limbaugh , who as erick erickson tweeted , has only done so once before . despite having the largest talk radio audience in the country , limbaugh typically does n't use his show in this way , i asked next why he was doing so now . he responded : " this is ball game , and michael , the only reason we 're at this point is because the american people have stood up . the republicans do n't have the votes to stop this . republicans may as well be martians on this given their influence . all we can do is continue to have the american <unk> let it be known they want no part of this -- the substance of the bill or the process . they do n't like it . and that 's why i am urging -- because this is a transformation of our country into something that no one has ever seen it be like .
