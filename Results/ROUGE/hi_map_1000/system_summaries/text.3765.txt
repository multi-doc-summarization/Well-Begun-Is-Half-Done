the white house acknowledged that president trump " spoke briefly " with russian president vladimir putin during a global meeting earlier this month , but insisted it was just a normal part of presidential duties and denied news reports surfacing tuesday that it was a second private meeting . " pretty much everyone at the dinner thought this was really weird , that here is the president of the united states , who clearly wants to display that he has a better relationship personally with president putin than any of us , or simply doesn ’ t care , " said ian bremmer , a former ambassador to ukraine who also specializes in russia and nuclear arms control . " if i was in the kremlin , my recommendation to putin would be , ‘ see if you can get this guy alone , ' and that ’ s what it sounds like he was able to do , " he said . " they were flummoxed , they were confused and they were startled. . " trump also denounced putin about whether he meddled in the second conversation by his own translator , which the hill reported is a breach of national security protocol . bremmer responded to trump 's tweets about the meeting on tuesday night . it was described to mr. bremmer by other guests as lasting roughly an hour and not initially disputed by a white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
