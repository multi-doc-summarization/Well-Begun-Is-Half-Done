a prominent british public relations guru said friday he 'd been approached by two women who claimed to have more material on prince harry , raising the possibility that the world may soon be seeing more compromising images of the british royal . earlier this week , celebrity gossip website tmz published photos of harry romping in the nude during a party at his las vegas hotel suite . many britons have laughed off the 27-year-old prince 's hijinks , but questions have been raised about his publicly-funded security detail . in a telephone interview , publicist max clifford said he had been called by two american women who claim they were in the prince 's hotel room in the us last week . clifford , a savvy operator famous for negotiating kiss-and-tell interviews , said the women " said they had lots of interesting things : pictures , video , that kind of thing . " he said he turned them down . " i could n't justify this , " he says . " there 's no way in the world that he would ever consider this but you 're talking about numbers in the six figures right off the bat . "
