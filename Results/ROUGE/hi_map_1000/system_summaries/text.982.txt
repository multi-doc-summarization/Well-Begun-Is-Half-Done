like any normal day , boyd jentzsch and his son , kai , put out food for the family of muscovy ducks that lived outside their wellington home . but on may 2 as they watched out their patio door at the mother duck and her 11 ducklings peck at their food , a lawn worker plotted a different fate for the birds , according to an arrest report . he gunned his riding lawnmower toward the ducks , which were perched on the grass near a tree in the family 's yard , and swerved his blades over them , the report stated . they wrote in the report that the nine baby ducks lost their lives " cruelly and viciously with extreme intent . " " i do n't want to hear about it , " he said . " i could n't believe it was happening . it was totally disgusting . " jentzsch says she is being held at the palm beach county jail on $ 27,000 bail on the animal cruelty charges . " it was one of the most emotional things i 've ever seen , " says jentzsch . " we were horrified . "
