a paper published today in the international journal of epidemiology confirms a link between peanut and nut intake and lower mortality rates , but finds no protective effect for peanut butter . men and women who eat at least 10 grams of nuts or peanuts per day have a lower risk of dying from several major causes of death than people who do n't consume nuts , peanuts reports . the reduction in mortality was strongest for respiratory disease , neurodegenerative disease and diabetes , followed by cancer and cardiovascular diseases . the researchers from maastricht university analyzed the worst type of dietary fat is the kind known as trans fat . it is a byproduct of a process called hydrogenation that is used to turn healthy oils into solids and to prevent them from becoming rancid . trans fats have no known health benefits and that there is no safe level of consumption . therefore , they have been officially banned in the united states . early in the 20th century , trans fats were found that mortality due to cancer , diabetes , respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases was also lowered among users of peanuts and nuts . project leader and epidemiologist professor piet van den brandt : " it 's a major source of energy . it helps you absorb some vitamins and minerals . fat is needed to build cell membranes , the vital exterior of each cell , and the sheaths surrounding nerves .
