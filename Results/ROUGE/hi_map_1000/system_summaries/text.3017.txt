a 12-year-old jaguar is being sent back from new delhi zoo after he was found “ too fat to breed , ” zoo officials tells the indian express . “ he was brought on a breeding loan but it has been over a year and salman has shown no interest in mating . in fact , the female is seen trying to entice him but he lies in a corner and refuses to respond . he is lazy , a glutton , just loves to eat and relax . every morning , we find leftovers in the cages of the other jaguars but this one polishes off his entire food . i am sure if we gave him more food , he would finish off that too . he has a bigger appetite than the tigers here , ” says a wildlife expert . “ now we know for sure nothing is going to happen . so it is the point in keeping him here ? ” the zoo says it 's not the only big cat in an indian zoo whose lack of mating interest has drawn criticism . salman was borrowed from a zoo in kerala a year ago , but has shown little interest in their female jaguar , kalpana and shankar , have also failed to give kalpana a cub .
