scientists are shedding new light on a massive solar storm that narrowly missed impacting earth two years ago . " if it had hit , we would still be picking up the pieces , " says daniel baker of the university of colorado said in a statement released by nasa this week . " i have come away from our recent studies more convinced than ever that earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did , " he said , per the new york times . the solar storm , which happened on july 23 , 2012 , was the strongest one ever recorded -- more than twice as powerful as any solar storm recorded in the last 15o years . scientists say it was actually two storms that combined their energy into one superstorm and followed the track of another storm days earlier . it wasn â€™ t some crazed dictator with his finger on the thermonuclear button or a giant asteroid that came close to wiping out civilization as we know it , though the eruption had occurred only one week earlier , earth would have been in the line of fire .
