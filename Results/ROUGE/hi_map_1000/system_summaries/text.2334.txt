the georgia institute of technology have created a reproduction of the 'mona lisa ' that is no wider than a third of the width of a human hair . north korea missile launch toward s. korea failed . how often does that happen ? could this be the end of sears and kmart ? parent company raises red flag . georgia tech researchers have created the " mini lisa " on a substrate surface approximately 30 microns in width . the image demonstrates a technique that could potentially be used to achieve nano-manufacturing of devices because the team was able to vary the surface concentration of molecules on very small portions of a substrate . mini lisa was rendered using an atomic force microscope and a process known as thermochemical nanolithography , or tcnl . using a microscopic cantilever , an anchored beam with a tiny , downward-facing point at one end , a patient georgia tech doctoral candidate named keith carroll , heated tiny spots on a surface to create a series of chemical reactions which are initially protected from chemical reaction by capping them with protecting molecules . the heat of the research team went pixel-by-pixel to create the reproduction .
