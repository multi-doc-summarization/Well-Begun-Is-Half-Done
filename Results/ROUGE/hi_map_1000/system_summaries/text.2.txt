" it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed , and as such led to a number of complaints to the bbc . however , since this episode aired ( october 2008 ) christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place . in relation to the john snow kiss-in event , i used this particular photo because i considered it to be quite mild ( no groping ) . the photos i had considered using before i chose that one are much more racy .
