alec baldwin is about to make your television great again , but it 's not clear whether he will be bringing back his famous donald trump impersonation to " saturday night live " this fall . " but i do know this : i first met alec baldwin more than 20 years ago . even before that , i was a huge fan of his work in the movies. , " he said . " i think when trump arrives , instead of playing ‘ hail to the chief , ’ they should do the theme of the godfather. . " clinton 's three-decade daughter , ireland , and family had gathered to honor the 30 rock star 's genuine interest in helping others , which he learned early on as a child from his irish-catholic family . clinton also found it inspiring that baldwin started making movies in his backyard when he was 5 , and that his interest in politics began in elementary school when he ran for class president . it was cemented during his days in college . " he ended up going to george washington university for two years , ran for student-body president , then came back home to new york where he followed a then-classic path , from politics into soap operas , " clinton said .
