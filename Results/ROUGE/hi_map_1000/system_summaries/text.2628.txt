an international team of scientists from the search for extraterrestrial intelligence have detected " a strong signal in the direction of hd164595 " in a document now being circulated through contact person alexander panov . the system is known to have at least one planet , hd 164595 b , which is similar in size to neptune and orbits its star in 40 days . other planets may exist in the system as well . the signal was made with the ratan-600 radio telescope in zelenchukskaya , in the karachayâ€“cherkess republic of russia , not far from the star hd 164595 , a sun-like star located roughly 95 light-years from earth . the observation was made on may 15 , 2015 , 18:01:15.65 ( sidereal time ) , at a wavelength of 2.7 cm . the estimated amplitude of the signal is 750 mjy . no one is claiming that this is the work of an extraterrestrial civilization , but it is certainly worth further study . working out the strength of the caucasus , the researchers say that if it came from an isotropic beacon , it would be of a power with a nearly identical metallic composition to our own star .
