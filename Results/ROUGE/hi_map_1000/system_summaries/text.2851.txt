the gene comes in three varieties , known as the e2 , e3 and e4 variants . since everyone inherits one version of the apoe e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis , which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries . this progressive narrowing of the gene from each parent , there are six possible combinations . for example , apoe alleles have been studied as a potential risk factor for age-related macular , an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss among older people worldwide . researchers also have found that adults with e2 variants have more plaques in their brains but are less likely to have symptoms of dementia . people who carry at least one copy of a rare condition called hyperlipoproteinemia type iii . most people with this disorder have two copies of cholesterol , certain fats called triglycerides , and molecules called beta-very low-density lipoproteins ( beta-vldls ) , which carry cholesterol and lipoproteins in the bloodstream . a buildup of cholesterol and other fatty materials can lead to the formation of small , yellow skin growths called xanthomas and the development of atherosclerosis .
