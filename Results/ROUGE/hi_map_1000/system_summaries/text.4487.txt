scientists are hailing a landmark british study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's by stopping the death of neurons . the compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases , which shuts down the production of essential proteins , leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off . it was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres . when enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain and prevents brain disease , is a first in itselfâ€¦ we can go forward and develop better molecules and i ca n't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice . i think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains. . " we were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells , restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice , " he said . " this is the first convincing report that a small drug , of the type most conveniently turned into medicines . "
