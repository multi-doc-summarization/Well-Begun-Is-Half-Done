alan thicke 's third wife is making moves to get more of his estate than she deserves , and they 're taking action to nip it in the bud . the sons , with attorney alex weingartenï»¿ , have filed legal docs in alan 's probate case , claiming his widow , tanya callau , is greedy and overreaching to get a bigger piece of the pie than their dad intended in his will . in the docs , thicke left each of his three children equal shares of a carpinteria ranch , 75 percent of his remaining estate , a $ 500k life insurance policy and said she could live at the ranch , as long as she paid for its expenses and maintained the property . " the thickes are asking the court for instructions concerning the extent to which the trust 's property is the actor 's separate property and whether callau 's challenge to the prenup is barred because she waived her community property rights when signing it , " he said . " that is exactly what we are going to do . " thicke 's sons , however , says she 's " threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity ' unless the co-trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands . "
