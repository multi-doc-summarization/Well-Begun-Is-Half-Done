robert de niro made a joke about first ladies , and newt gingrich said it was " inexcusable and the president should apologize for him. " of course , if something is " inexcusable , " an apology says . " now , even as we speak , there are those who are preparing to divide us , the spin masters , the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of ‘ anything goes. ’ well , i say to them tonight , there is not a liberal america and a conservative america . " maher , who is the recent flap : " callista gingrich . now do you really think our country is ready for a white first lady , " he said . " we can move on to the next time we choose sides and pretend to be outraged about nothing . when did we get it in our heads that we have the right to never hear anything we don ’ t like ? in the last year , we ’ ve been shocked and appalled by the unbelievable insensitivity of nike shoes , the fighting sioux , hank williams jr. , cee lo green , ashton kutcher , tracy morgan , don imus , kirk cameron , the super bowl halftime show and the espn guys who used the wrong cliché for jeremy lin after everyone else used all the others .
