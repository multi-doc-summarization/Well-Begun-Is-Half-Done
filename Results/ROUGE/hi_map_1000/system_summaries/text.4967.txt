president trump says the u.s. may have gotten a " little bit lucky " after hurricane irma veered from its original course and headed west along florida 's coast . he says irma may not have been quite as destructive as a result , but that things will play out over the next several hours . trump addressed reporters sunday after returning to the white house from camp david , the eye of irma should hug florida 's west coast through monday morning and then push more inland over northern florida and southwestern georgia on monday afternoon . the storm made landfall on the florida keys and later near naples , but florida 's eastern coast was far from spared sunday from the almost 400-mile-wide storm . in miami , high winds snapped construction cranes and water swept down streets like rivers . " we 're going to be monitoring any types of crimes , " miami police commander freddie cruz told usa today . " people are going to get through this , " gov . rick scott told workers in the state emergency operations center in tallahassee . " weakening proved to be a problem too , with thousands of businesses and homes empty due to evacuations . "
