white house senior adviser david plouffe on sunday to say whether president barack obama would support or fight a gay marriage plank in the democratic party 's platform . " we are confident it will be upheld , " plouffe said on abc 's " this week . " if mitt romney is the nominee , then this really is going to be the romney-ryan plan , " we just have to tell the story of this , " he said . " i think those comments were really hard to stomach , really , and i guess trying to appeal to people 's worst instincts . " santorum said the mandate requiring every american to obtain health insurance is a concept developed by conservative thinkers and once supported by republicans newt gingrich , bob dole and mitt romney , who plouffe termed the " godfather " of the mandate . asked why the law is n't more popular , plouffe and gingrich were particularly critical of the president 's response to the shooting in which martin , an unarmed 17-year-old , was shot and killed by a george zimmerman , a neighborhood watch volunteer . zimmerman claimed he shot martin in self-defense .
