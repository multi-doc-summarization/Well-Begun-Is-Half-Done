netflix 's shareholders will be given the right to acquire more stock if any individual investor acquires more than a 10 % stake in the company , commonly referred to as a " poison pill . " the company announced on monday that its board had adopted a shareholder rights plan , or poison pill , just days after mr. icahn disclosed he had acquired a 9.98 percent stake . netflix said the plan was meant to protect the company and shareholders from " efforts to obtain control of netflix that the board of directors determines are not in the best interests of netflix and its stockholders. " in a statement on monday , icahn capital says that " any poison pill without a shareholder vote is an example of poor corporate governance , and find the pill netflix just adopted is particularly troubling due to its remarkably low and discriminatory 10 percent . " netflix 's board members were n't available for comment , notes the ap . " adopting a rights plan is a very reasonable thing to do in light of the recent , and stealth , accumulation of stock and options by an activist investor , " a netflix spokesman says . " its goal is to maximize the value of the stock by flooding the market with additional shares , making it expensive for an investor to acquire a controlling stake . "
