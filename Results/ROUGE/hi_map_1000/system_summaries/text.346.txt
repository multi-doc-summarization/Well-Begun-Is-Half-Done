" i don â€™ t know who arranged this , the court or the president . the judiciary has said that everything is being done according to their procedures. , " he said , per the washington post . " those who imposed sanctions on us are now facing economic recession . " ahmadinejad 's decision to pardon the men is subject to review by iran 's clerical authorities . bauer , an arabic speaker from minnesota who graduated from berkeley in 2007 with a degree in arabic and peace and conflict studies , was a middle east correspondent for new america media and has written for brave new traveler , an online travel magazine . at the time of her arrest , she had been told by court officials that each of them would have to pay $ 500,000 in bail , as shourd had to do . he said the bond was being demanded because , even though bauer and fattal have been convicted , their case is open to appeal and a final verdict has not been rendered .
