a group of house republicans led by the chairman of a powerful committee moved tuesday to impeach the head of the internal revenue service , saying he violated the public trust . he failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena , documents were destroyed on his watch , and the public was consistently misled . " it appears that facts simply do n't matter to republicans , " chaffetz said in a statement . " impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the irs and to protect the institutional interests of congress. . " the irs committee has been investigating the irs for more than two years , since agents were discovered to have subjected conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status to additional scrutiny . chaffetz was joined by 18 committee republicans in sponsoring an impeachment resolution , which now goes to the house judiciary committee . house democrats quickly denounced the move as political grandstanding . " we have fully cooperated with all of the investigations , " says chaffetz said . " he said the impeachment resolution was " ridiculous " and a waste of taxpayer money . " chaffetz also charged that koskinen failed to notify congress the evidence was missing . but , in the past , the irs has said it has fully complied with all investigations . in july , chaffetz 's panel indicated it could pursue action against koskinen , after arguing he had misled the committee and impeded its investigation into the improper scrutiny .
