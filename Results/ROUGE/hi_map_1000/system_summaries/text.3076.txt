former new york governor george pataki suspended his bid for the republican presidential nomination tuesday , after a campaign that appeared doomed almost from the start by both his long stretch out of the national spotlight and the mismatch between his moderate politics and a party turning harder to the right . pataki announced the suspension of his campaign in a two-minute message that aired on nbc affiliates in iowa , new hampshire and south carolina . he upset a democratic legend , then-new york gov . mario cuomo , in 1994 and won reelection twice in a famously liberal state . pataki flirted with a presidential run three times before , in 2000 , 2008 and 2012 . but each time , he withdrew . for one reason or another , pataki said that the country needs to elect a president who can do three things : " confront and defeat radical islam , shrink the size and power of washington , and unite us again in our belief in this great country. , " he said . " you have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines. . " he added , " i 'm confident we can elect the right person . someone who will bring us together and who understands that politicians ' including the president . i know the need to have a vision for the future of this country is absolutely essential . i have that vision . my life has prepared me for this moment .
