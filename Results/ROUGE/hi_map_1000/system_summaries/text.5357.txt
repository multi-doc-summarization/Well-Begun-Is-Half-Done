god 's little people cat rescue on the greek island of syros is looking to hire a live-in caretaker . the job comes with free housing and a salary , according to a post on the organization 's facebook page . " paid job offer with cats ! ( this is genuine and not a joke â€” friends , please feel free to verify ! ) , " the posting reads . " a very special position and living circumstance on offer on a little greek island called syros ( a small paradise no less ! ) " ( syros is a non-profit cat sanctuary located in santa barbara , california , dedicated to the rescue , care and adoption of abandoned cats and kittens . it is my not so humble opinion that god outdid himself when he created cats . they are sometimes filled with grief and call because they miss having a kitty around to give the unconditional love they are so good at bestowing upon us . whether the reason for thinking of adopting a cat or kitten is the loss of your own or the desire to give a furry friend a good home , i would love to hear from you . this site explains what resqcats is about and how you can help .
