a new proposed amendment to the revised code of washington has proposed a bill that would allow fans to bring guns into stadiums . the bill was proposed by republican representatives matt shea , david taylor and bob mccaslin and would prevent stadium operators from bringing certain items , including firearms , into said stadiums . house bill 1015 , proposed by three republican members of the state house of representatives , would eliminate the stadiums ' ability to " prohibit persons with a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in any facility or on any grounds of a facility . " " centurylink , like safeco , is located on public property . but it 's run by a private enterprise , one that prohibits people from bringing in guns . the new law , first noticed by the seattle times , would change that . here would be a stunning turn if the league suddenly allowed people to bring firearms into the stadium . and there 's the whole matter of fan safety , of course . we saw in raiders-chiefs that people are n't afraid to see the league cough loudly and inform local politicians that the passage of such a law would be greatly frowned upon .
