an australian ship which picked up possible " pings " from the black box recorders of a missing malaysia airlines jet have been unable to detect any further signals and time is running out to narrow the massive search , officials say on tuesday . angus houston , the retired australian air chief marshal who is heading the search far off australia 's west coast , said sound locating equipment on board the ocean shield has picked up no trace of the signals since they were first heard late saturday and early sunday . time may have already run out to find the devices , which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished on march 8 and flew thousands of kilometers , near where possible pings were picked up and the search is now focused . " if we do n't get any further transmissions , we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long , long time . it 's very slow , painstaking work , " he said . " that 's why it 's so important to get another transmission and we need to continue until there 's absolutely no chance the pings might have come from . "
