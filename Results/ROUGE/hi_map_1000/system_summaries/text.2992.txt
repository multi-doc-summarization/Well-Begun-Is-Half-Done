a new study has been found in the understanding of how language evolved in humans , researchers report in the online journal plos biology . " it is the first evidence outside of a human that an animal can use the same meaningless sounds in different arrangements to generate new meaning , " researchers say . " in contrast to most songbirds , the chestnut-crowned babblers do not sing , " she said , per the university of zurich . " we think that babbler birds may choose to rearrange sounds to code new meaning because doing so through combining two existing sounds is quicker than evolving a new sound altogether. ‚Äù " the birds seemed to understand the meaning of the calls . when the feeding call was played back to them , they looked at nests , while when they heard a flight call produced while feeding chicks . while the birds showed that they could tell the difference between the two arrangements by looking at the nests they emitted in specific behaviors . " the study notes that researchers say the birds produced a flight " call to make their whereabouts known , but when alerting chicks to food they combined the arrangement of sounds within a song does not seem to alter its overall message .
