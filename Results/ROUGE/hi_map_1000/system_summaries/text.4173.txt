president trump spent a speech at a rally in nashville wednesday night . president trump spoke in front of the hermitage , jackson 's home in nashville , tennessee , which he toured before delivering remarks . trump said on the 250th anniversary of jackson 's birth that jackson was " one of our great presidents . " a day before the executive order was to take effect , u.s. district judge derrick watson blocked the limitations on travel and immigration . watson 's ruling in hawaii was just the latest hindrance to trump 's ongoing promise to protect the country from terrorism . he has continuously argued a temporary limit on travel is necessary while an " extreme vetting " process is instituted to better gauge the potential threat of those wishing to enter . trump signed the revised executive order on march 6 , replacing his january 27 ban which was met with widespread protests and legal challenges after travelers from seven majority-muslim countries in the middle east and africa were prevented from travelling to the u.s . the original order was blocked by a federal judge 's temporary restraining order in washington state in february -- a move that the 9th circuit court of appeals later declined to stay .
