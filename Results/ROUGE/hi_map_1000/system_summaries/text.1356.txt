the international fusion reactor project in france is reeling from an assessment that found serious problems with the project 's leadership , management , and governance , the ap reports . the report is so damning , science has learned that the most complex machine ever built will be switched on in an alpine forest in the south of france . the machine , called the international thermonuclear experimental reactor , or iter , will stand a hundred feet tall , and it will weigh twenty-three thousand tons—more than twice the weight of the eiffel tower . at its core , densely packed high-precision equipment will encase a cavernous vacuum chamber , in which a super-hot cloud of heavy hydrogen will rotate faster than the speed of sound , twisting like a strand of dna as it circulates . it would realize a yearning , as old as the story of prometheus , to bring the light of the heavens to earth , and bend it to humanity ’ s will . iter , in latin , means “ the way. will be cooled to two hundred and sixty-nine degrees below zero , nearly the temperature of deep space . ”
