a baby crying from outside his wife 's hospital room was born on january 21 this year with down syndrome . " this pediatrician walks out of the room with a little bundle -- that was leo , " forrest said . " she had his face covered up and hospital authorities would n't let me see him or my wife . when i walked into the room they all turned to me and i looked at this guy and i said , he 's lost a lot in two weeks . it 'd be different if he had his mommy . " forrest , who 's from auckland , new zealand , tells abc news . " the mother refused to even look at or touch leo for fear of getting attached in a society where defects are not accepted and often bring shame on the family involved , " he says . " i didn â€™ t have a lot , i have very little in fact . the goal is to raise enough for a year so i can get a part-time job so leo does n't have to be in daycare and i can help care for him . "
