abortion rights advocates made a final push wednesday against proposed state rules that would require abortion providers to cremate or bury instead of disposed in sanitary landfills , the ap reports . the rules will take effect dec. 19 , according to state health officials , the texas tribune reported . " it creates an undue burden on women who either have an abortion or a miscarriage , " says blake rocap , legislative counsel for advocacy group naral pro-choice texas , the dallas morning news . " while the methods described in the new rules may have a cost , that cost is expected to be offset by costs currently being spent by facilities on disposition for transportation , storage , incineration , steam disinfection and/or landfill disposal . " " it 's so transparent that what they â€™ re really trying to do is denying access to abortion , " williams said in an email , per the ap . " the rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients for no reason other than to make it harder to get a safe , legal abortion in the state . "
