italy 's david holding a massive ar-50a1 was published in an italian newspaper last night . the company tweeted it on may 15 , 2013 , and part of the company 's " work of art " campaign : " the image of david , armed , offends and infringes the law . we will take action against the american company so that it immediately withdraws its ( advertising ) campaign , " culture minister dario franceschini tweeted , per the new york times . " the country , which claims the copyright to the statue , is trying to force armalite to remove its ad , " he said . " it is an act of violence towards the sculpture ; like taking a hammer to it and perhaps , actually , even worse . " he added , " certain cultural icons belong to everyone and no one ; to humanity in general , " she said . the ad was both in " bad taste " and " completely illegal . " a philosopher and the city 's historical heritage and fine arts board , cristina acidini , has reportedly issued the company with a legal notice asking for the image to be withdrawn .
