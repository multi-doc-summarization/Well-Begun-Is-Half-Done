the roman catholic diocese of pittsburgh said on wednesday it had removed cardinal donald wuerl 's name from a high school after a grand jury report on sex abuse in the church found he had reassigned priests who had been accused of abusing children to remain in ministry , after relying on the advice of psychologists who had assessed the priests . mcfadden wuerl previously served as the archbishop of pittsburgh , and the report included accounts of his allowing several priests accused of sexually abusing children but that over subsequent years he granted requests by some to be reassigned to other parishes or to retire early , and in one case approved a loan to assist one such priest with personal debts . " our discernment here , i believe , has indicated the way forward to bring healing and a new beginning at the service of this church , " wuerl said . ed mcfadden , a spokesman for the archdiocese of washington , said he will meet with francis about the resignation he presented nearly three years ago at age 75 , the mandatory age for catholic bishops to submit their retirement to the pope . he said a decision about his future " is an essential aspect so that this archdiocesan church we all love can move forward .
