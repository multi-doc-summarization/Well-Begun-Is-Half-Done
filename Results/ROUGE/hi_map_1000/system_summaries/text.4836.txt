marijuana use may result in heart-related complications in young and middle-aged adults , according to a french study reported in the journal of the american heart association . " in prior research , we identified several remarkable cases of cardiovascular complications as the reasons for hospital admission of young marijuana users , " researchers say . " we assume the deaths of these two young men occurred due to arrhythmias evoked by smoking cannabis , " he said . " it is therefore important that doctors , including cardiologists , be aware of this , and consider marijuana use as one of the potential causes in patients with cardiovascular people . " the man had a small amount of marijuana in his pockets when he was found dead at home by his girlfriend . an ashtray , rolling paper and a sealable plastic bag containing remnants of marijuana were found next to the body . the percentage of reported cardiovascular complications more than tripled from 2006 to 2010 . nine patients , or 25.6 percent , died . researchers note that marijuana use and any resulting health complications are likely underreported . there are 1.2 million regular users in france , and thus potentially a large amount of complications that are not detected by the french addictovigilance system .
