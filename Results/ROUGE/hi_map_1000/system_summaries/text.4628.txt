a kickstarter campaign for a new card game has raised its $ 10,000 goal , and an hour later , it was called " bomb squad " and loses the game , reports the bbc . " we think this game combines all the things we 're best at creating , and and put together this kickstarter campaign because we ca n't build this without you . so if you 're into card games or laser beams or weaponized on things they should n't be chewing on . from there , the rest of the cards fell into place , and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you 'd use to defuse an exploding kitten , or make it more likely for other players to pick one up . all of the end , we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans , and that could be our solution . our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence , but by doing the things that kittens do , like running across keyboards or chewing . we think you 'll love it as much as we do . hugs and enchilada kisses , -elan , matt , and shane .
