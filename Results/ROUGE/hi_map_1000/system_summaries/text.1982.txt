facebook is putting finishing touches to new features on users ' home pages that deeply integrate music services from partners including spotify , mog , rhapsody , and rdio . " they are working on a platform for music where the goal is to create a connective tissue for fans , " says a facebook spokesperson . " many of the most popular music services around the world are integrated with facebook and we 're constantly talking to our partners about ways to improve these integrations . " the music and media platform will be announced at facebook 's developer conference , which kicks off on september 22 . facebook has declined to comment on its new music platform before , but in july several technology blogs reported a software engineer had uncovered programing code for a facebook product called 'vibes ' for music downloading . facebook could give an important boost to its fledgling music streaming partners as they try to compete in a digital music sector dominated by apple inc service . " there 's the new form of radio or tv , " he said . " we 've also heard whispers that facebook intends for this platform to go beyond music â€” for example , it 's possible that netflix could stream movies through facebook . however , that facebook does n't like playing favorites , so our bet is that facebook will go beyond the music platform announcement at f8 .
