ted cruz , a new york times report that he failed to properly disclose a loan from goldman sachs during his 2012 bid for the u.s. senate , calling the matter merely a " filing error . " it was an inadvertent filing question , " not borrowed money , " the campaign says . " if it was the case that it was not filed exactly as the fec requires , we 'll amend the filings . " cruz 's wife , heidi , worked for goldman sachs at the launch of the texas senator 's presidential run , reports the new york daily news . " the facts of the underlying matter have been disclosed for many , many years , " he said . " but all of the information has been public and transparent for many years . it is no indication that his wife was involved with the loan . mr. cruz disclosed to the fec at the time that he had put roughly $ 1 million in personal funds into his election campaign , but he didn â€™ t disclose that the source of that money may have been the loans he received from citigroup and goldman sachs .
