" he belongs to the ages , " obama said in a somber appearance at the white house . " i can not fully imagine my own life without the example that nelson mandela set . " mandela died earlier thursday at 95 in his johannesburg home with his wife , michelle , and two young daughters to the prison at robben island , where mandela was in captivity . the obamas also met privately with members of mandela 's family . he had spent much of the year in and out of the hospital , and his illness prevented a meeting with obama when the u.s. president visited south africa this summer . however , the former south african president 's legacy hung over obama 's trip . " the united states has lost a close friend , south africa has lost an inspiration for freedom , justice , and human dignity. , " the president of south africa tells obama . " we can not reach any higher/ if we ca n't feel ordinary love . "
