cindy hyde-smith was expected to coast to victory in a mississippi runoff that would conclude the last senate race of 2018 's midterm elections , the ap reports . hyde-smith , 59 , is the first woman elected to congress from mississippi . if espy had won , he would have been the first black senator from mississippi since shortly after the civil war . having been heavily favored to win the reliably republican state , hyde-smith became engulfed in a political storm over a video showing her praising a supporter at a nov. 2 event by saying , " if he invited me to a public hanging , i â€™ d be on the front row . " she later called the comments an " exaggerated expression of regard , " but her use of the phrase " public hanging " brought memories of mississippi 's history of lynchings to the forefront and put the contest under the national microscope . on tuesday , mississippi voters will decide between hyde-smith and democrat mike espy , who , if elected , would be the state 's first black senate election on tuesday . but they say the midterm elections are over , and now that democrats have taken control of the house , trump 's doomsday warnings about what would happen if democrats were put in charge seemed to lack the urgency they had in the weeks leading up to the nov. 6 elections .
