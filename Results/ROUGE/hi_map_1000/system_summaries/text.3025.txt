the united states , france and britain together launched military strikes in syria to punish president bashar assad for a suspected chemical attack against civilians and to deter him from doing it again , president donald trump announced friday . explosions lit up the skies over damascus , the syrian capital , as trump announced the airstrikes from the white house . syrian television reported that syrian air defenses have responded to the attack . trump said he has asked u.s. partners " to take greater responsibility for securing their home region , including contributing large amounts of money for the resources , equipment and all of the anti-isis effort . " he said there is " no doubt " that the syrian government is responsible . macron says the operation is limited to syria 's abilities to produce chemical weapons . he called on moscow to change course and join the west in seeking a more responsible regime in damascus . the allied operation comes a year after the u.s. missile strike that trump said was meant to include barrages of cruise missiles launched from outside syrian airspace . he adds that , " as other nations step up our contributions , we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home .
