an 89-year-old nazi war crimes suspect from philadelphia has died a day before a judge ruled that he should be extradited to germany to face trial , his lawyer says . johann breyer , 89 , died on tuesday night at a philadelphia hospital , attorney dennis boyle said wednesday . he was accused of taking part in the killing of hundreds of thousands of jewish men , women and children during his time as an auschwitz death camp guard . a judge issued an order on wednesday approving a request for breyer 's arrest last year charging him with 158 counts of aiding and abetting the deaths of 216,000 jews . his lawyer said at a hearing last month that breyer , who walked with a cane , had mild dementia and heart issues . he has american citizenship because his mother was born in the u.s. ; she later moved to europe , where breyer was born . in 1992 , the u.s. government tried to revoke breyer 's citizenship after discovering his wartime background . rice had found probable cause that " breyer , the individual before this court , is the same person sought for aiding , abetting murder in germany , " he said . " given breyer 's role as an elite ss armed guard at a camp designed and operated almost exclusively as a killing center for jews , germany has established probable cause of breyer 's complicity in the mass murders at auschwitz .
