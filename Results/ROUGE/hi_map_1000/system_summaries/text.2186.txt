jpmorgan morgan chase ceo jamie dimon plans to be in detroit today to announce a $ 100-million investment in the city that began several months ago with a phone call to billionaire dan gilbert , the quicken loans founder who owns or controls more than 40 downtown buildings . " obviously , detroit was having issues , " dimon told the free press this week in an exclusive interview . " i got together some of our senior people and said , 'what can we do that 's really neat , that could be really ... unprecedented , in some regards , but jpmorgan chase believes that detroit has the ingredients and intrinsic strengths to reshape and rebuild a dynamic modern economy and make the city a great place to live , work and invest . " the city has been lobbying to secure nearly $ 200 million in funding from michigan lawmakers , who are wary of setting a precedent by using taxpayer dollars to bail out a major metropolis . if approved , the state funding would be used to cushion pension cuts for detroit retirees and avert the sale of the city 's art collection . jpmorgan 's support , previously reported by detroit newspapers , will focus on city revitalization efforts and may help ease concerns by some legislators that detroit could find itself in financial trouble again down the road .
