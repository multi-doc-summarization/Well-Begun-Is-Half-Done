" the diagnosis can be made on the basis of specific criteria , then these criteria are either fulfilled or not fulfilled . this is a matter of concern because such misdiagnoses can delay be held in mind until the evidence conclusively rules them out : in making the diagnosis of the cause of illness in an individual case , calculations of probability have no meaning . the pertinent question is whether the disease is present or not . whether it is rare or common does not change the odds in a single patient .
