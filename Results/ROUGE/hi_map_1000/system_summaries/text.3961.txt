james cameron has been a best director nominee , but it 's not clear that it 's a " rare example where the quality of the movie does indeed exceed the hype , " reports the bbc . " we can hold our heads high . we got the picture done by the skin of our teeth . it 's been a four-and-a-half-year process and it â€™ s a relief to let people see it , to quit talking about it , " he writes . " the movie may owe more than a few plot points to the story of pocahontas , and there may be some grousing at a fairly heavy-handed treatment of corporate greed and our lack of american energy independence ; but the key question , is cameron able to deliver a movie that packs the entertainment value and emotional punch of 'titanic . " " the plot is set in the next century , with humans trying to take vital resources from a distant planet called pandora slipped beneath the atlantic waves . and your critic is sure that , even when he is pushing a zimmer , he will remember the moment the main spaceship of the baddie corporation goes down in avatar . it is overwhelming , and that is because you are emotionally tied up in the characters and the story .
