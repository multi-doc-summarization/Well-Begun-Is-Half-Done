john bradshaw is a " cat yourself " in the huffington post today . " in cat society , this sequence is usually performed by a smaller cat towards a larger one -- a kitten or young cat towards its mother or an older relative , a female towards a male , " bradshaw says . " when cats started becoming friendly towards us , maybe 5,000 to 10,000 years ago , they just adapted this piece of behavior to show that they like us , too , " he said . " so if your cat is doing any one of these , then it likes you ! it does n't have to be all three -- for example , some cats ( in my experience , especially the long-haired ) do n't much like sitting on people 's laps , but if they 're reliably doing the tail-up/rub , then everything 's okay . " he added , " the advice would be , take your time when approaching your cat , and wait for it to do it if it 's the person who makes the first move . so the new feline science can make you a better friend to your pet ( which has been attracting the history and behavior of cats for decades . " )
