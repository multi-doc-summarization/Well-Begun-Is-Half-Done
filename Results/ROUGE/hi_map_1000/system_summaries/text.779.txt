herman cain 's top adviser and the newest youtube star of the 2012 presidential campaign has posted to cain 's account , and shows the former wisconsin political operative reflecting on the campaign and puffing on a cigarette . " we 've gotten used to being baffled by herman cain on an almost daily basis , but a new ad his campaign released last night really takes things to air as a paid television ad , features mark block , staring straight into the camera and whose name and face are unrecognizable to virtually every republican primary voter , is curious , but what makes the video so bizarre is what happens when he finishes speaking : with an aggressive soundtrack rising in the background , block raises a cigarette to his mouth , takes a drag , and puffs out a cloud of smoke . watch it for yourself : the intent of the smoking shot is unclear , but it could represent cain â€™ s defiant response to recent media scrutiny of his three-year run in the late 1990s as the head of the national restaurant association , during which time he aligned the lobbying group with the tobacco industry . as the new york times reported in a profile of cain that ran over the weekend : in the words of one youtube commenter who we 're not going to try to top .
