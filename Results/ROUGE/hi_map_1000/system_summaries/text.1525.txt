a very smart speech by speaker boehner by ezra klein if you spent the afternoon watching c-span , as i did , you heard applause . " i am honored and humbled to represent a great , hard-working community in congress . the people of ohio ’ s eighth congressional district continue to afford me the privilege to serve , for which i am deeply grateful , " he writes . " it ’ s about them , not us . what they want is a government that is honest , accountable and responsive before the public it serves . " he added , " we will part with some of the rituals that have come to characterize business as usual , and a renewed focus on the constitution . our aim will be to give government back to the people . in seeking this goal , we enter into a season of service by having ashes marked on our foreheads . the ashes remind us that life in all its forms is fragile – our time on this earth , fleeting . as the ashes are delivered , we hear those humbling words . " the speech : " we are carrying out their instructions . "
