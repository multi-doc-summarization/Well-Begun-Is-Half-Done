more children are born to women older than 35 than to teenagers , a change born of medical science , later marriages and evolving attitudes about motherhood . " i think everyone will welcome a decline in births to teens , " researchers said . " it 's notable that the population of teens is larger than it used to be , so there were more who could have become teen mothers . " the pew research center , citing census and government health statistics , said the trend toward mothers who are older and better educated cuts across all ethnicities in the united states . between 1990 and 2008 , the number of births to 441,000 in 2008 , an increase from 41 percent in 1990 . among mothers 35 or older , 71 percent had at least some college education before giving birth . the average age for marriage has been rising , as has the share of women who have attended college . women with more education often delay marriage and childbearing while they complete their schooling and establish careers . " we 're trained to think science can solve all fertility problems , " says a senior writer on the study . " children born to highly educated mothers increasingly are born later in life . the mothers are usually married , and they have a much higher chance of raising children in a stable marriage that lasts through a child 's childhood .
