the danish radio host who killed a baby rabbit live on air , in a stunt he was killed by repeated blows to the head with a bicycle pump and asger juhl , one of the radio station 's hosts , later skinned it with his children and planned to eat it as rabbit stew with his family and fellow host kristoffer eriksen . " i was instructed by a zookeeper from aalborg zoo who hits several baby rabbits every week [ to feed ] the snakes , " he told broadcaster tv 2 . " we are animals and we eat meat . that 's the way it is , and we have to be confronted with the fact that animals die when we stand in front of the supermarket 's refrigerated counter . we do n't kill animals ourselves . " he 's been widely criticised for the act , but it 's not clear whether he expected to shine a light on the conditions faced by animals in denmark 's agriculture sector . " danish consumers allow chicken farms to keep 13 chickens per square meter . and they accept lengthy and painful transport of animals to the slaughterhouse , " radio24syv says .
