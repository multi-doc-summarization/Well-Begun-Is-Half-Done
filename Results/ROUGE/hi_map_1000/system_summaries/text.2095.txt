the number of advertisers who have at least temporarily cut ties with rush limbaugh grew to seven on sunday in the aftermath of the conservative radio host 's self-described " insulting word choices " about a female law student . proflowers , an online florist , is one of the latest companies to announce it would halt advertising on limbaugh 's show . " no one with daughters the age of sandra fluke , and i have two , could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well-intentioned young lady . mr. limbaugh , with his highly personal attacks on miss fluke , overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency . even though mr. limbaugh has now issued an apology , we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising from his show . we hope that our action , along with the other advertisers who <unk> will do the right thing and not only suspend their values as a company . as an advertiser , we do not have control over a show ’ s editorial content or what they say on air . carbonite does not endorse the opinions of the shows or their hosts.however , the outcry over limbaugh is the worst we ’ ve ever seen . i have scheduled a face-to-face meeting next week with limbaugh during which i will impress upon him that his comments were offensive to many of our customers and employees alike.please know your voice has been heard and that we are taking this matter very seriously.sincerely .
