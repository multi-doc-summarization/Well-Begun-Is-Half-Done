osama bin laden 's death of al-qaeda , who was killed by us forces in 2011 the us central intelligence agency , was shot dead at a compound in abbottabad , in an unusual decision taken to mark the five year anniversary of the 2011 raid , the agency 's twitter account is publishing an hour by hour description of the top secret mission against the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks . the decision to tell the story using the same timings as the day of the raid , " as if it were happening today " was designed to mark what will be a key part of president barack obama 's legacy , and remind the public of the agencies role in the historic operation . the cia 's usual tweets mostly concern historical trivia and artefacts . " @ potus [ president obama ] receives confirmation of high probability of positive identification of usama bin ladin , " cia director john brennan says . " just under 90 minutes later , " he said . " it 's not completely eliminated , so we have to stay focused on destroying all the elements of that organisation . "
