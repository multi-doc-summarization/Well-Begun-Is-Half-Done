the " horrific " slaying of a practitioner of chinese herbal medicine , his wife and their 5-year-old daughter in their california home does not appear to be random , authorities say . the crime was discovered wednesday when sheriff 's deputies responded to a call for a welfare check on the residence in a modern neighborhood on winding streets just outside santa barbara . after obtaining a search warrant , detectives entered the home early thursday and coroner 's investigators collected the remains , which were identified as those of 57-year-old dr. weidong " henry " han ; his wife , 29-year-old huijie " jennie " yu ; and their daughter , emily han , a kindergartner . county and state forensics teams were brought in to process the scene and autopsies were to be conducted to determine the cause and manner of death . " from my very few interactions with [ emily ] , she seemed like a sweet and curious child who was very interested in learning about other kids and the world at large , " said independent senior editor matt kettmann , whose son is in her class . " early indications are that this was not a random attack . "
