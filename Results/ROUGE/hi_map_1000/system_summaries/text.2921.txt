the hollywood reporter has a long , stunning investigative article out today called " animals were harmed. , " reports the bbc . the deaths of three horses on the set of hbo 's horse racing series luck—which was overseen by the aha—are well known ( and probably contributed to luck ’ s cancellation ) , but the illness was not work-related and was not due to any activity related to production . sadly , a dog did take ill and was indeed diagnosed with cancer , and the dozens of sheep and goats that died during a hiatus in the filming of the hobbit : an unexpected journey . the article suggested that a horse died during post-production after being filmed for " war horse . " what it does not say however is that aha 's jurisdiction does not extend to post-production and transit . in fact , the horse mentioned finished its work and was checked out of production . in transit home , the article seemed to lay blame for 27 animal deaths during " our idiot brother . " " i think what people think [ the aha ’ s monitoring ] is just when the cameras are rolling. , " she says . " we heard reports months afterwards that animals might have died on a working farm there , we voluntarily sent representatives out to the farm to inspect it and make safety recommendations , which were instituted by production at considerable cost , ensuring better welfare for all the animals on the farm . we were transparent with all the details and our outrage over the regrettable loss of life .
