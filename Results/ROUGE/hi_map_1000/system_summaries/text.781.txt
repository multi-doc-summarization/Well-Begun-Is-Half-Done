the florida family association , best known for badgering companies into pulling advertising from tlc reality show all-american muslim last year , is hard at work ranting about a new target : bioware/ea game star wars : " allout.org has temporarily disabled the campaign page of its website due to a cyber attack by hackers . in the attack , hackers added roughly 3000-5000 comments and signatures onto the petition . this is n't the first temper tantrum that supposedly pro-family groups have thrown over the old republic , just the most recent . the headline of the alarmist new missive asks : " " will the makers of star wars video games create darth vapaula , a ( mock version of darth vader , one of the most popular star wars characters , and rupaul , the renown transgender cross dresser , " he writes . " for the first time , did all the different wikis . the original runs were just against the enwiki . this collection will be complete , as there is a good chance we will share the data , and sharing data with pointers to random other collections , is a complex problem . but we know that today , on this issue , they are taking an important stand that should be celebrated and supported . anti-gay groups are the dark-side here , and we â€™ re glad to see so many consumers and citizens joining forces to pressure companies like ea and beyond to promote fair and balanced portrayals wherever they pop up .
