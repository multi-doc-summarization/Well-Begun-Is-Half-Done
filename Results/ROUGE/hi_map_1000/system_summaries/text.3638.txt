" the most beautiful paintings are those one dreams of while smoking a pipe in one ’ s bed , " he said , per the bbc . " it was to his bed that the bleeding van gogh returned after his notorious self-mutilation and visit to a local brothel where he delivered part of his ear to a girl . from then on he only spent a few nights at home , being mainly confined to the arles hospital.he had thought of taking his bed to the asylum in saint-rémy , where he retreated in may 1889 but instead left it in arles , and the bed then passed to his widow , jo . she immediately moved back to holland , where she set for the last weeks of his life . while in auvers , he wrote to his brother , by bernadette murphy , suggested that this was not a prostitute , but a local farmer ’ s daughter working there as a servant . murphy also uncovered a drawing , made by a doctor long after the event , his stay was abruptly curtailed by the events of 23 december . bailey is sure that theo would have threatened the closeness of their relationship , and also left theo with a wife and family to support , unable to fund a struggling brother who had yet to sell a single canvas .
