the planet of the apes acclaimed blockbuster franchise , caesar , and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless colonel , the bbc reports . the first told solely from the apes , it follows simian ruler from its original source , claiming the admittedly not-very-competitive crown as the summer 's best sequel . reprising up not long after the last movie ended , caesar is leading his community of intelligent apes here ; look no further than the opening scene for a hint of “ the great escape . ” matt reeves , who helmed the second film in the franchise , is a good example of how today 's movies sometimes beat the hell out of the oldies . the sophisticated characters and wrenching emotions created with motion-capture technology so eclipse those rubber ape masks in the originals while carving out the movie 's own rich mythology . perhaps foremost , at a time when reliance on computer-generated characters to carry the action often produces mixed results , the chimp leader caesar ( performed and voiced by andy serkis ) and his posse quickly overcome those obstacles , and since this is a movie unafraid of scenes of characters talking to one another , special effects are used to support the story rather than supplant it . in what appears to be the concluding of a studio marketing department , the craven and transparent impulse that hobbles so many big summer movies . in fact , they have created a story that is coherent and credible , and with character motivation fully thought out .
