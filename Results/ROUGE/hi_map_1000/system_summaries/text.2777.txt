a long-running legal battle between global chocolate giants over the shape of kitkat finger wafers was sent back to the eu ’ s trademark office on wednesday after judges dismissed appeals by both companies . the ruling by the european court of justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar 's maker , nestlé , which argued that it owns the shape on the left , from nestlé 's application ? after four years of back-and-forth , the court battle began in earnest , see-sawing from one side to the other during appeal after appeal . what 's in a shape ? wednesday 's ruling threw out nestlé 's appeal , telling the eu trademark office it has to " reconsider the end of " the snack 's protected european status . " it also takes the pressure off identical treats like norway 's kvikk lunsj ' s , which was bought by the swiss in 1988 . in 2015 , the global chocolate giant applied for a trademark in europe for kit kat . there was no issue with the bar itself , embossed with the kit kat logo . but it also applied for brands operating across the eu single market , where there are varying histories in national markets . it has also at times featured in britain ’ s brexit debate , with some supporters of cutting ties with the eu suggesting that eu courts have failed to prove a kit kat was recognisable in every eu country - and no evidence had been provided for belgium , ireland , greece and portugal .
