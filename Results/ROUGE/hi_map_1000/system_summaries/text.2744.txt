four republicans voted no on the bill , but house democrats on friday broke ranks to support a republican bill that would allow health insurers to continue selling plans canceled under obamacare through 2014 , the first test of support on capitol hill since the law ’ s disastrous rollout . the house voted , 261-157 , to pass the bill by rep. fred upton . the vote is a further blow to obama , who was forced on thursday to admit that new standards under the healthcare law are forcing millions of people into new and often more expensive health insurance plans . obama repeatedly said that under obamacare people could keep their plans if they liked them . most of the democrats who defected from their party face tough reelection campaigns next year . republicans have seized on the letters , as well as promises by president obama that “ if you like your health plan , you can keep it , ” the president of america ’ s health insurance tells the ap . “ we knew this was a promise [ obama ] could not keep , and now it is a promise he has broken . ”
