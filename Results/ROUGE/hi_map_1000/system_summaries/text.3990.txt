brian williams becomes the next reporter to almost , but not quite , hold rick perry to account for the execution of cameron todd willingham . during the gop debate wednesday night , williams asked without naming willingham , or going at perry armed with the science that undermined the prosecution 's case . " no , sir . i 've never struggled with that at all . the state of texas has a very thoughtful , a very clear process in place of which -- when someone commits the most heinous of crimes against our citizens , they get a fair hearing , they go up to the supreme court of the united states , if that 's required , " he writes . " there is nothing that connects anthony graves to this crime . i did what i did because that 's the right thing to do . " a neighbor later tells police that he had been playing in her back yard when she smelled the smoke . she ran inside and told her mother , diane , and they hurried up the street ; he reached the kitchen , where he was hit by water from a hose and had to retreat . he then charged through the front door , wearing only a pair of jeans , his chest blackened with soot , his hair and eyelids singed . he was screaming , “ my babies are burning up ! ”
