as cities across the country are tearing down and relocating confederate monuments , a county in southern alabama on sunday unveiled a new one . several hundred people attended a dedication ceremony for the " unknown confederate soldiers " who died in the civil war but have been forgotten by history , particularly those from crenshaw county and the surrounding area . the memorial now stands in a confederate memorial park first opened in may 2015 on private land in an unincorporated area next to dry creek rv park about three miles north of brantley . it sits among existing monuments , replica cannons and tall flagpoles flying confederate and other flags . " that 's why i 'm in it , that 's what it 's all about . we should all be proud of our confederate ancestors , " jimmy hill , commander of the alabama division of the sons of confederate veterans member who operates both the rv park and the adjacent memorial park , told the energetic crowd during introductory remarks he made from a wooden stage . " it 's to let people know that what our ancestors did was not in vain , " he said . " this has been in the works for nine months , but because we put it on the website two days after [ the charlottesville clashes ] , the media put that together . "
