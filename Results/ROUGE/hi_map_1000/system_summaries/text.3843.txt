iranian authorities have delayed the trial of two americans arrested near the iraqi border in july 2009 , a judiciary spokesman said on monday , less than a week before they were due their first day in court . shane bauer and josh fattal , who say they were hiking in northern iraq and were not aware they had crossed into iran , are at the center of a third suspect , sarah shourd , who was arrested with the men but released on $ 500,000 bail in september this year and returned to the united states . " so the trial should be held on saturday then the judge will decide whether the trial will be delayed or not , " shourd said . " all we know is iran has held them far too long. . " the state department spokesman , philip j. crowley , confirmed that on sunday , " it is illogical . if they want to delay the trial , they should announce it in a notification to me or to sarah shourd . they did n't , " masoud shafiee told reuters . " we don â€™ t know whether they had two feet on one side or the other or one foot on each , " he said .
