president trump has voted to release a classified memo they wrote that the fbi and the justice department improperly used government surveillance during the investigation into russian election interference and contacts with president donald trump 's campaign . that 's according to rep. adam schiff of california , the ranking democrat on the committee , the ap reports . the vote to release the memo comes after committee republicans , led by chairman rep. devin nunes , a california republican , pushed for its disclosure . schiff says wray told him his concerns with the memo were not alleviated just because he reviewed it . " the review did not satisfy , i think , either the bureau or [ doj 's ] concerns , " schiff said . " we had crossed a deeply regrettable line on this committee , " he said , per the ap . the memo addresses a dossier of allegations against trump compiled by a former british spy , and questions over whether it was used to obtain surveillance warrants . __ gowdy had urged devin nunes to share its contents with the bureau , two people familiar with the meeting said monday . gowdy also wanted nunes to let deputy attorney general rod rosenstein see the memo too , but he did not join them sunday .
