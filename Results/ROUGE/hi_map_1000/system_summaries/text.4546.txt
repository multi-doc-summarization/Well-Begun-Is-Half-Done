convicted sex offenders have been released into the community after serving a sentence of at least 12 months in jail , the ap reports . the trial was carried out from 2009-11 in two midlands areas and found that offenders taking such tests were twice as likely to tell probation staff they had contacted a victim , entered an exclusion zone or otherwise breached terms of their release licence . continuing concerns about the reliability of the tests and misinterpretation of the results mean they still can not be used in any court in england and wales . " introducing lie detector tests , alongside the sex offenders register and close monitoring in the community , will give us one of the toughest approaches in the world to managing this group , " a spokesman says . " they will be able to call on this technology to help stop sex offenders from reoffending and leaving more innocent victims in their wake . " the government aims to roll out the tests next spring , subject to the parliamentary timetable . the move follows a successful pilot scheme in the midlands . trials in two areas found the tests made sex criminals more open with probation officers . polygraph tests measure blood pressure , heart rate , breathing and levels of perspiration . these vital signs display subtle changes when someone is deliberately evasive and polygraph experts can usually determine if that person is lying .
