kim kardashian was left feeling all-white at a glitzy event to promote her new perfume on thursday night after she was pelted with a bag of flour . the woman was detained by cops at the event and the local fire department was called to ensure the powder was not dangerous . they left again when they determined it was just all-purpose flour . however , kim was a real pro , and after dusting herself down in a private room , she returned to the carpet about 10 minutes later . there 's no exact reasoning as to why this woman did what she did , but kardashian 's rep held her and security escorted her away . kris jenner commented on the " festive " event , telling us , " like i said to my makeup artist , i wanted more powder and that 's a whole lot of translucent powder right there . i wonder you that woman would n't have dared tried a thing . ' i wish i was with my sister tonight . i bet if they would have dared thrown the flour at my hormonal and pregnant self ! "
