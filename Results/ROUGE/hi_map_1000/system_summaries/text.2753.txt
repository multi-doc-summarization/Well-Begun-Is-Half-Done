a military strike is the only way to respond after concluding gas in its civil war , the ap reports . when russia seized on u.s. secretary of state john kerry 's offhand that syria could avoid u.s. strikes by giving up its chemical weapons , i reacted , like many , with highly cautious optimism that this could offer a small but significant reprieve for syrians and success for obama . but doran had a very different take : that this is a dishonest ploy by russia and syria that boxes in the unites states and , more importantly , makes any relief for syria 's civil war far less likely . doran made his case against the plan on twitter , in the form of eight " truths about our new policy of working with putin " to secure syrian chemical weapons . even if you think that obama should pursue russia 's proposal , doran raises some important concerns . key quote : " obama now needs assad and putin . he is their partner in this sham process , " he said . " and we call on the syrian leadership to not only agree to setting the chemical weapons storage sites under international control , but also to their subsequent destruction. . "
