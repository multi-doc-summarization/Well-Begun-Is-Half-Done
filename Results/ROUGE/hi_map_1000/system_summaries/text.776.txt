two lunch boxes hidden in the toilets of a jet airways plane triggered first a bomb scare and then a smuggling probe as the tins were found to contain 12 gold bars each , a senior customs official said on wednesday . smuggling is on the rise into india , one of the world â€™ s biggest buyers of gold , after the government raised import duty to a record 10 percent and slapped restrictions which have shrivelled supplies into the domestic market . the revenue intelligence officer said a man had been arrested in an earlier case on suspicion of concealing 5 kg of gold in the toilet of an air india plane in dubai . he left the plane in mumbai and another passenger removed the gold after it had flown on to goa . crews are now on alert for passengers lingering in the loo . " we feel that what we catch is less than 10 percent or so and there are so many groups operating , it is impossible for us to keep a check , " says an official . " the gold bars are from dubai for sure . the flight had come from patna to kolkata last , but later we found they contained 12 pieces of gold bars in each . "
