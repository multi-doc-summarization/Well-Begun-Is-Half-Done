president trump bears responsibility for general motors 's " notion that there was some kind of fundamental break " between himself and the late president george h.w , the ap reports . the elder bush , who died at 94 in his houston home on friday night , made several comments to presidential biographer jon meacham in his 2015 book , " destiny and power : the american odyssey of george herbert walker bush , " that were critical of cheney 's militaristic policy prescriptions after the 9/11 attacks . " and clearly general motors ' decisions are in part based upon the tariff issue , so yes it has an impact , and it costs us jobs here in america . " cheney said bush reached out to smooth things over after his critical comments became public and sent him a note that said , " dear dick , i did it. . " " i do think the way the president has gone about the trade policies , imposing tariffs -- there â€™ s a consequence , there 's a domestic consequence , " bush said . " we lost the unity that we needed in dealing with china . "
