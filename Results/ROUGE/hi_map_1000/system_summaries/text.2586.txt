amy winehouse accidentally drank herself to death at her north london home , a coroner has confirmed . winehouse , 27 , was found dead at her home in camden , north london , in 2011 . the verdict is identical to the first hearing which had to be repeated after the deputy coroner had been hired by her husband , senior coroner for inner north london area , but had not been a registered lawyer for five years . winehouse 's live-in security guard andrew morris spoke about the moment he realised she was dead . " i 'm satisfied on the balance of probability that amy voluntarily consumed a large amount of alcohol in a deliberate act that took an unexpected turn and led to the death of a talented young woman at such an early age , " he said . " she was genuinely unwilling to follow the advice of doctors , being someone who wanted to do things her own way . " winehouse 's statement , however , says she was " a level of alcohol commonly associated with fatality . " the doctor 's statement also heard the same evidence as the first inquest .
