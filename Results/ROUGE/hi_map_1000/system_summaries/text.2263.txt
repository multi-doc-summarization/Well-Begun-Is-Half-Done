an egyptian man hijacked an egyptair plane tuesday and forced it to land in cyprus , where most passengers were eventually allowed to get off , though four crew members and three passengers remained on board with the hijacker . egyptair flight ms181 took off from the mediterranean coastal city of alexandria en route to cairo with at least 55 passengers , including 26 foreigners , and a seven-member crew . an official with flight-tracking website flightradar24 said the hijacking was " not something that has to do with terrorism " and a cyprus government official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was n't allowed to disclose details of ongoing negotiations , said the man gave negotiators the name of a woman who lives in cyprus and asked to give her an envelope . it at least means that this time egypt can not be accused of letting someone smuggle explosives through airport security and on to an airliner as they did in october at sharm el sheikh airport , destroying a russian passenger jet in mid-air . but it still triggers a number of worrying questions about aviation security . how was it that a passenger , described by the cypriot authorities as " mentally unstable " was able to carry enough materials through alexandria airport to resemble a bomb ? and what is to stop any future airline passenger , similarly unarmed , from pretending that he or she has a real device strapped to them ? for egypt 's battered tourism industry , that has yet to recover from the october airline bombing , this hijack is a further blow it can ill afford .
