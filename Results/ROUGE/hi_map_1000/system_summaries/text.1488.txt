john mccain 's military service has increased 18 % support among republicans in a cnn/orc international poll released sunday morning . jeb bush follows in second place with 15 percent . since a similar poll in late june , trump ’ s support has risen 6 points since a late-june poll , while support for bush and walker has not changed significantly . none of the other 14 candidates tested in the new cnn/orc survey earned double-digit support . though trump currently tops the race for the nomination , his advantage is by no means firm . a majority of republican voters , 51 % , say they see the field as wide open , and that it 's too soon to say which candidate they will ultimately get behind . " there 's a movement going on , this is more than me , " trump tells the hill . " people are tired of these incompetent politicians in washington i ca n't say i ’ m unhappy or anything , i 'm just not that surprised. ” the poll also found that most republican voters want donald trump to remain in the field . the republican electorate is more enthusiastic about next year 's vote than the democrats are .
