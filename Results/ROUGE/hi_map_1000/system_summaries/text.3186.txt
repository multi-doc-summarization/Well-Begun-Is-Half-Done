james watson 's 1962 nobel medal for his new book called avoid boring people in science canceled after the apparently racist remarks he made to britain 's sunday times magazine last weekend  , reports the bbc . he was scheduled to speak friday at the science museum in london , but the museum announced the day before that it would hope all people are equal in intellectual capacity , " people who have to deal with black employees find this not true . " watson , 79 , says he is " inherently gloomy about the prospect of africa , " he said . " all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours  whereas testing says not really . " " the university of edinburgh then axed watson 's scheduled appearance for monday , calling the scientist 's remarks " entirely incompatible with the spirit " of the lecture series in which he was supposed to participate . and an event organizer in bristol , which had booked the dna pioneer for oct. 24 , dropped watson as well , saying the first textbook of the new science , the innovative and highly influential molecular biology of the gene ( 1965 ) , followed by his memoir of the discovery , the double helix ( 1968 ) , and the scientific community soon rallied around their achievement in subsequent research on dna and issues of molecular biology . watson ’ s 1962 nobel prize for physiology or medicine represents not merely a pinnacle in scientific achievement , but it is estimated at $ 2.5 to $ 3.5 million . no single person has done more to make dna central to modern life than dr. watson .
