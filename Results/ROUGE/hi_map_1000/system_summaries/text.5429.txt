the trump administration told lawmakers the u.s. government has reached a deal to put chinese telecommunications company zte corp back in business after it pays a significant fine and makes management changes , a senior congressional aide said on friday . " i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees , change of management and board , must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $ 1.3 billion fine. , " he said , per reuters . the deal notes that zte has been sued for patent infringement an additional 100 times in china , germany , norway , the united kingdom , canada , australia , and other countries . as an intellectual property renegade , zte certainly gets around . even when it 's not being sued , zte thumbs its nose at the traditional rules of fair play in intellectual proper matters , commonly engaging in delay , misrepresentation , and hold out when dealing with patent owners . while zte is more than happy to accept royalty payments for the use of its own intellectual property , he should not ease up on zte until it stops its high-tech banditry and starts playing by the rules in intellectual property .
