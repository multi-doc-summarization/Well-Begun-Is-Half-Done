audi is introducing an industry-first system that tells drivers how long it will take for a traffic light to change from red to green . the system wirelessly links vehicles to traffic-management computers in certain u.s. cities . audi is finalizing contracts and says it will announce the cities soon . drivers see the countdown in the instrument cluster . once four seconds are left before the traffic light turns green , the counter stops so drivers will look up . if the system thinks a driver wo n't make it through a green light , it will also start counting down as if the light were red . the feature , which allows the cars to receive traffic light information in areas that have centralized control , will roll out city by city . " it â€™ s information like this that allows your mind to relax , " audi general manager pom malhotra said . " this is not an app , " malhotra tells the ap . " these are all enhancements we are looking at with this technology , " he said . more broadly , though , communication between vehicles and traffic infrastructure is seen as critical for the evolution of self-driving cars , which costs between $ 25 and $ 33 per month and includes a range of traffic , safety and entertainment services , including music streaming , as well as the cellular data needed to deliver those services . or the car could look at the estimated stop time , combined with traffic data , to see if it makes sense to instead turn right and take a different street .
