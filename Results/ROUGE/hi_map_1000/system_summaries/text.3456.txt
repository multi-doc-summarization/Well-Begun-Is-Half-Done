new jersey democrats will decide who will be only the fourth african american elected to the u.s. senate since 1972 . the winner of today 's primary election will be republican steven lonegan , a former mayor of bogota , n.j. , and a political cipher who has never once proposed anything to address the structural causes of the problems he claims to care so deeply about . booker will , however , have to do it all over again next year , when the term frank lautenberg was elected to in 2008 expires . the bigger issue for a lot of observers is whether booker has national ambitions . for admirers , he â€™ s the next barack obama , a charismatic african-american pol with possible transpartisan appeal . to detractors , he 's an unholy combination of harold ford , jr. and joe lieberman , beholden to wall street and silicon valley . " a booker victory will mean the replacement of a reliable , plodding progressive with a less reliable neoliberal , " he writes . " he is the worst sort of democrat , and democrats should be doing everything in their power to wrest control of the party away from people like him . but that is why cory booker is bad as a phenomenon . "
