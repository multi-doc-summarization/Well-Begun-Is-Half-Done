transformers is a testament to advances in cgi , but it 's not clear whether it 's a good thing . the film was shot partly in detroit , but mainly it 's actually the damaged optimus prime ( biggest of the good robots ) , and all set out to do battle with government types , scientists , outer space robots and their clones . explosions , explosions , junkyards battling , explosions . prime gets what few surviving good robots exist back together , they team up with yeager , daughter and a superfluous boyfriend ( jack reynor ) , he nurses it back to health . which is when the bad cia guys show up , leading to endless battles and explosions . it 's really all about the robots , the orgiastic display of cgi destruction , and lacking in anything remotely resembling a creative impulse . for those who care about continuity , events in transformers : age of extinction take place five years after those of the previous film , transformers : dark of the moon . by this time , the transformers have been virtually eliminated from earth as a result of a ruthless cleansing scheme spearheaded by cia black ops hotshot harold attinger ( kelsey grammer in full stinky pete mode . )
