the sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attack is by far the most memorable moment shared by television viewers during the past 50 years , a study released on wednesday concluded . the only thing that came close was president john f. kennedy 's assassination and its aftermath in 1963 , but that was only for the people aged 55 and over who experienced those events as they happened instead of replayed as an historical artifact . sony electronics and the nielsen television research company collaborated on the survey . they ranked tv moments for their impact not just by asking people if they remembered watching them , but if they recalled where they watched it , who they were with and whether they talked to other people about what they had seen . by that measure , the 2003 bombing of baghdad at the start of the iraq war was seen as the no . 14 most impactful moment by men , and no . 37 among women . men were also far more struck by boxer mike tyson biting off a piece of evander holyfield 's ear . minutes after the first airplane struck new york 's world trade center on a late summer morning , television networks began covering the events continuously and stayed with them for days .
