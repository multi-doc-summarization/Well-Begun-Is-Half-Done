a record number of people signed up for obamacare in the first few days of open enrollment this year compared to the same period in previous years , several sources close to the process told the hill . the surge in sign-ups , which was confirmed by an administration official , comes despite fears from democrats that enrollment would fall off due to the trump administration 's cutbacks in outreach and advertising . " i still run into people who are wondering , am i still going to have a plan next year ? " independence blue cross chief executive officer daniel hilferty said in an interview . " our member plans are generally ramping up their efforts to kind of plug that hole . " acting health and human services secretary eric hargan said in a speech last week that the administration wants the sign-up period to be " as consumer friendly as possible . " the administration cut the outreach budget by 90 percent and cut back on grants to outside groups , called navigators , that help people enroll that millions of americans will be left without healthcare if it is dismantled . the advertising serves two roles : it helps draw in the young , healthy customers who keep overall member costs down and it addresses confusion among many people over whether the subsidies that help make coverage affordable to many and obamacare itself still exist in the wake of trump â€™ s actions .
