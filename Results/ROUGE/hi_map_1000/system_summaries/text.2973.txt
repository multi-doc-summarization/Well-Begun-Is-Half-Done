it 's not a selfie , but it 's the first flagship phone from hmd global , the finnish company that now owns the most important new handset in its attempts to revitalise the once world-beating brand for the modern smartphone era dominated by samsung , apple and china 's huawei . the nokia 8 , in addition to its bothie-ness , offers most of the trappings of a good phone : 4 gigs of ram , 64 gigs of storage , brand-spankin'-new processor , crisp audio pulled from nokia â€™ s high-end 360-degree camera and a high-resolution 5.3-inch screen . nokia handsets are being revived by hmd keys and larger display bezels despite an emerging industry trend to fire up both the rear and front-facing cameras at the same time , shooting video or photos of a subject and the smartphone operator simultaneously , which can be shared live directly to facebook or youtube . " we know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before , with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media , " says juho chief product officer . " people are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. . "
