its unusual billboard is serving its purpose , grabbing people 's attention and making patrons of a local strip club think twice about how they spend their money . their sign quotes jesus from hebrews , saying simply , " strip for me . " the message : instead of spending money in a strip club , spend it in a way that will better your family and yourself . even more powerful is the location of the sign , which can be seen just behind the palace gentlemen 's club sign on 3rd avenue west in downtown birmingham . pastor mike mcclure , jr. expected some negativity in response to the billboard but he does n't mind . he says his church is out to change lives of magic city men . " we stratigically picked the strip club because we want the brothers who are walking in ... to know god has a greater cause for your life , " he said . " i 'm trying to get brothers to put that money back into your home . go home , raise your kids , and he punishes each one he accepts as his child. . "
