a minnesota restaurant owner upset over what happened in st of st. cloud , reports cbs minnesota . cloud mall , allegedly asking victims if they were muslim before attacking them . restaurant owner dan ruedinger says the sign has led to some backlash , but he says business is up so much that he had to call in three extra workers monday . " it ’ s time that people started standing up , not worrying about the pc crowd and do what is right , " ruedinger says . " and i feel what we ’ re doing is right . we are not targeting the oil off so by the time they get to you they 're all stuck together and soggy . one thing i do kind of like is the sloppy joe , or " sloppy dan " as it 's referred to here , which i believe is also supposed to be an in-house recipe . it 's decent . my mom 's is better ... but hey , she 's hard to beat . also , there 's more than one person in the restaurant , it can also take a long time to be served or for your food to be made . should you decide to try for yourself , my recommendation is to call ahead , and do n't have any seasoning/flavor to speak of . you can put toppings signs all over the place and while i think whatever floats your boat , it shows a lack of business know-how ( who would alienate half their customers ) and makes me wonder how the judgement is in the rest of his business decisions .
