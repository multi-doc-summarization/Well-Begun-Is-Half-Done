a philadelphia man was caught red handed this week for using a cell phone jammer to keep his fellow passengers on a public transit bus from using their cell phones . " i guess i 'm taking the law into my own hands , and quite frankly , i ’ m proud of it. , " eric says . " it should go without saying that such a device is illegal . a jammer , which blocks radio frequencies , isn ’ t just limited to blocking personal cell phone use , but all communication tools that use these frequencies . what does this mean ? essentially that the jammer that lessens the din of personal conversations on your m-14 bus also has the potential to cut off communication between the driver and dispatch centers or public agencies , which could result in a public safety snafu—or disaster . jammers also block incoming calls , which means that if used for an extended period you prevent anyone in your vicinity , press a button and point it at them , then continue reading his book under his creepy hood ... i 'm pretty sure it was one of those devices that cuts off signals ; jennifer lopez used one in enough , so that ’ s all the scientific analysis i need .
