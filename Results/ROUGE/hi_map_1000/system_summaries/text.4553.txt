a thai surrogate mother left with a down syndrome baby who was abandoned by his australian biological parents said tuesday she would be happy to have the baby 's healthy twin returned , especially because of concern over reports the father is a convicted sex offender , the ap reports . the boy , named gammy , is currently in hospital being treated for a life-threatening lung infection and will need operations for a heart condition . his surrogate mother , pattharamon chanbua , has told journalists he was abandoned when his australian parents took his sister home but left him . she said the father would not look at gammy and did not carry him during the month . a gofundme page has raised more than $ 200,000 for gammy since the story of his alleged abandonment was first reported last week but the administrators of the father 's past have raised doubts in her mind . " personally , when i heard the news i was shocked but i ca n't say anything much right now , " she said , adding that she would " leave it to the law " to see if she can get the girl back . the process appeared to have been carried out legally under contract in thailand and western australia , though other states in australia do not allow it .
