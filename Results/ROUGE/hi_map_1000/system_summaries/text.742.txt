" it has a potent darkening effect , " the bbc quotes the bbc . " we wanted to know whether it would be tested first would be in individuals who are at the highest risk for developing skin cancer . even individuals with just modestly darker skin have a significantly lower skin cancer risk than fair-skinned people who don â€™ t tan , but burn . we discovered a class of compounds that have the ability to penetrate their drug with sun-cream to give maximum protection from solar radiation . it is not yet clear if the drug might have the unintended consequence of affecting the glorious hair colour , but it is thought the hair follicle is too deep in the skin for the drug to reach .
