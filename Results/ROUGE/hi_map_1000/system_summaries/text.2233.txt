it 's not a dead hunk of the moon enceladus , but it 's a warm ocean on enceladus , the new york times reports . " the moon is actually alive in a sense , " says a planetary scientist . " if you could swim a little bit further from the really hot part then it could be comfy , " he said . " we 've known from quite early on that enceladus was the source of the material in saturn 's ocean , perhaps like those where we believe life began on earth , " a scientist at cornell university who works with the laboratory for atmospheric and space physics at the university of colorado at boulder . beneath the surface , most researchers believe it even has a liquid ocean . now hsu and his colleagues estimated the temperature , salinity , and approximate ph of enceladus 's ocean by studying the dust in saturn â€™ s outermost ring . really , the particles is connected to what 's happening on the lunar sea floor , which is cooler than many hydrothermal vents at the ocean bottom where there 's no sunlight .
