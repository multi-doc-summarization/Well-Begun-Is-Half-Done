united airlines has been a real dick lately , but it 's not clear whether it 's a good time . the airline 's pr department first issued a statement explaining blandly that the chicago-to-louisville flight late sunday was overbooked , and that “ after our team looked for volunteers , one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate . we apologize for the overbook situation . further details on the removed customer should be directed to apologize . " the video is just the latest in an increasingly enraging pattern of bad behavior by the airline . it was just a couple of weeks ago that united refused to allow three young girls to board their flight , because they were wearing leggings . " this is an upsetting event to all of us here at united , " he said . " if you go for this option , negotiate the terms and make sure the airline ’ s initial response to the publicity already has left it covered in shame . this peaceful form of protest is called a boycott , and it ’ s loads of fun . this is not a normal thing to do . even the best part is that there are plenty of other airlines out there that don ’ t afraid to kick you off .
