scientists say the discovery of a heretofore unknown family of spider that some have playfully compared to bigfoot , the privacy-loving man-beast of legend . in the journal zookeys , california academy of sciences arachnologist charles e. griswold and colleagues described their discovery of trogloraptor , or “ cave robber , ” a spider that is partial to caves and redwood debris in coastal forests from california to british columbia . trogloraptor , which is roughly the size of a half-dollar coin when its legs are extended , has large raptorial claws , suggesting it is a fierce , specialized predator . roughly a dozen specimens were plucked from the roofs of caves by scientists and spelunkers who found them hanging from a few strands of spun silk . most were obtained in southwest oregon , while one adolescent spider was found in the debris of old-growth redwoods in northwest california . the klamath-siskiyou region of oregon and california is home to a number of ancient species of plants and animals , including the coastal red tailed frog and the mountain beaver . study authors note that with many caves and hard-to-access areas , this may not be the last historic find . " if such a large and bizarre spider could have gone undetected for so long , who knows what else may lurk undiscovered in this remarkable part of the world , " the study says .
