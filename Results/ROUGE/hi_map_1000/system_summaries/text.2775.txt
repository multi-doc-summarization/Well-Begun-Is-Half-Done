a video released by mexican media outlets wednesday appears to show a soldier executing a civilian lying face down in the street with a shot to the back of his head . the ministry said in a statement that prosecutors should “ comprehensively clear up ” whether the video indeed showed the soldier shooting the detained man after a clash last week between security forces and suspected criminals . published online , the video shows a silver four-door car slowly reversing into the frame on a darkened street with gunshots hitting it and marks already visible on its windshield . at least one shot appears to come from the rear door on the driver 's side , which is ajar . " we were there watching tv and suddenly you heard like collisions , " said a man who lives at the intersection where the shootout occurred . he gave only his first name , joaquin , saying he feared repercussions if his identity was revealed . he said there was a lot shouting from various voices and he could hear vehicles reversing and advancing , then shooting . mexico 's treasury secretary said tuesday the practice costs the country $ 780 million to $ 1 billion each year .
