a chinese tourist who tried to report a stolen wallet during a visit to germany unwittingly signed an asylum application that got him stranded as a refugee for two weeks in the country 's burgeoning asylum bureaucracy . the well-dressed 31-year-old , known as mr l. , spoke only mandarin . german authorities discovered their mistake after turning in desperation to a local chinese restaurant to interpret for them , a red cross official said on monday . " he spent 12 days trapped in our bureaucratic jungle because we could n't communicate , " he said . " germany is unfortunately an extremely bureaucratic country . especially during the refugee crisis i â€™ ve seen how much red tape we have . " the man said he had been only a tiny number of chinese asylum seekers over the years , and he signed a medical exam , but drew the attention of staff partly because he was well dressed . " what would you expect if you had come to europe as a tourist and spent 12 % sleeping on a camping bed in a refugee center ? " he says . " it kept trying to talk to people to tell his story but no one could understand him . he kept asking to get his passport back , which is the opposite of what most refugees do . "
