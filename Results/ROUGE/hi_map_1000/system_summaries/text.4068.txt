the un general assembly next week has been to the united nations to request our legitimate right , obtaining full membership for palestine in this organization . " we need a state , a seat at the united nations. , " he said . " as for other options , we have not yet taken a decision on them , " abbas said in the speech from his office in the west bank city of ramallah , which was broadcast live on al jazeera and other outlets . " if we succeed , and this is what we are working towards , then we must know that the day following the recognition of the state , the occupation will not end , " says abbas . " but we will come back to negotiate the issues , but god willing , we need full membership in the un . " he added , " we 're not going there to bring independence , we will have obtained the world 's recognition that our state is occupied and not disputed territory , as the israeli government claims . " abbas , however , says he would seek a vote on the issue in the security council , but he said he would have any illusions that he would come back from new york with independence . " i need to put an end to the occupation and take away the legal status of the occupation . "
