jpmorgan chase have surged $ 2 billion of paper losses , and chief executive jamie dimon said it could lose another $ 1 billion or more . the losses will grow , some traders say , because it appears jpmorgan has only sold a small portion of its position , leaving it vulnerable to price swings in a thinly traded market . others are not so sure the bank will suffer much more than it already has . dimon said the bank wo n't rashly sell , and any additional losses could arise throughout the year . " i 've been through this exercise a few times , and i ca n't make the numbers make sense , " he said . " we think the number will be less " than a $ 5 billion estimate , they said . the bank â€™ s leadership has discussed the impact of the losses on future earnings , although a dividend cut remains highly unlikely for now . in march , the company raised the quarterly dividend by 5 cents , to 30 cents , which will cost the bank about $ 190 million more this quarter , reports the bbc .
