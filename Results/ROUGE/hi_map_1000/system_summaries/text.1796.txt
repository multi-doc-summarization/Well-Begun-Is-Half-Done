it 's a hat of the most historically sacred objects to the nation 's 16th president , but there 's no plans to display it . a museum spokesman tells the chicago sun-times that the hat is a beaver fur hat in lincoln ’ s size , but it 's not on display , but the hat will not be for months , reports the bbc . " there was just a level of secrecy by our foundation , helped by at that point a member of our staff , to do that dna testing that just seemed … very , very strange to me , " he says . " it is delicate , and too much exposure to light and fluctuations in heat and humidity can damage it , so we don ’ t often have it out in public . " the museum , which has been encouraged by a staff member of the smithsonian , says he only recently saw a copy of the farmer and chicago museums , which is now seeking millions of dollars in state taxpayer support and private donations to repay $ 9.7 million in outstanding loans on the purchase of the hat and 1,600 lincoln-related artifacts .
