the wall street journal editorial board accused mitt romney of being a technocrat and not a conservative . in his speech in ann arbor , mich. , romney 's speech : " i greatly respect governor romney and admire many of his personal and professional accomplishments , but his work to institute the precursor to national socialized medicine is not one of them . both romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government ’ s healthcare cost burden . romneycare has , in fact , not made healthcare better or saved costs in massachusetts . it ’ s done just the opposite . " romney , who was a specific solution for the specific needs of massachusetts , is exactly the justification for the same feature in obamacare . the mandate , conservatives believe , is an infringement on individual freedom . but it was one that will only deepen conservative criticism . romney proudly defended his plan and the individual mandate that is now the object of the entire republican party ’ s ire . the first was a defense of romneycare , but he did not name one specific aspect of the massachusetts health-care system and that of other states , why shouldn ’ t he believe that romneycare should be the model for every other state ? indeed , was when romney said that “ there ’ s not a lot that i want to borrow from france and switzerland. ”
