president obama 's speech to the israeli people thursday at a university in jerusalem , which drew boos from the crowd . " this is part of the lively debate that we talked about . this is good , " obama said . " you know , i have to say , we actually arranged for that , because it made me feel at home , " he said , per the washington post . " i would n't feel comfortable if i didn ’ t have at least one heckler . " the president was speaking to an audience of university students when a heckler began to shout from somewhere in the room . talking points memo reported that the heckler was demanding the release of former u.s. navy intelligence officer jonathan pollard , who is currently serving a life sentence in prison for spying on the obama administration to release pollard . in a march 14 interview for israeli television , however , president obama said that pollard committed “ a serious crime ” and that there are currently “ no plans ” to release him . obama has been heckled twice during public speeches in the u.s. , once by south carolina ’ s rep. joe wilson ( r ) , who bellowed “ you lie ! ” during the 2010 state of the union address , and again by dailycaller.com reporter neil munro during a speech in the white house rose garden in june of 2012 .
