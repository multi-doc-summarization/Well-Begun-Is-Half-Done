michael sailstorfer has buried gold bullion worth a total of £10,000 buried on the beach in folkestone and once the tide is out at 4pm on thursday it 's finders keepers . organisers of the folkestone triennial on thursday afternoon revealed details of a project it has been at a beach in kent where a german artist buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of an arts festival , the ap reports . " it is a participatory artwork . it is about people coming to the beach and digging and possibly finding hidden treasure . some people will not get lucky , and that 's life , " he said , per the german artist . " so often public art funding is spent on a static sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say , actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time . " the bars are of different sizes and standard gold bullion marked made in london , although anyone expecting the kind of gold bars you see in heist films may be disappointed . nevertheless , each bar could be worth several hundred pounds and if you find one . " an interesting part of the artwork is considering whether it is going to be worth more later ? will its price increase as an artwork or as a piece of gold ? " he says . " as well as the fun of finding gold , organisers believe the mass digging of the beach will create its own piece of land art , washed away when the tide comes back in . "
