chad johnson was sentenced monday to 30 days in jail for a probation violation in a domestic violence case by a judge who angrily rejected a deal with prosecutors calling for community service and counseling instead of jail . broward county circuit judge kathleen mchugh said she would tack on an additional three months ' probation because johnson had failed to meet with his probation officer during three previous months . it was all set until johnson , when asked by mchugh if he was satisfied with his lawyer adam swickle , gave the attorney a light swat on the rear _ as football players routinely do to each other on the field . " i do n't know that you 're taking this whole thing seriously . i just saw you slap your attorney on the backside . is there something funny about this ? " johnson tells the judge . " this is your courtroom . i have no intent to make this a joke . it 's not funny . " johnson , 35 , tried to apologize and insisted he meant no disrespect . johnson was on probation after pleading no contest to head-butting his then-wife , tv reality star evelyn lozada , during an altercation last august . she quickly filed for divorce after barely a month of marriage and johnson , a six-time pro bowl wide receiver , was immediately released by the miami dolphins . he did n't play at all last season .
