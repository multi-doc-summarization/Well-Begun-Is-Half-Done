a black woman has ever been nominated for a best director oscar , but it 's not a place to complain about the five nominees who did make the cut , although anyone who knows me well enough knows which one or ones i could have swapped in and out . david oyelowo , who earned rave reviews for his portrayal of martin luther king , jr. in selma and mark ruffalo in foxcatcher , were also nominated . after months and months of speculation , the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced its academy award nominations this morning , honoring the supposedly best of 2014 in film . and in large part , they did do just that . the marvelous boyhood got lots of recognition , for its writing , acting , and directing . laura dern , beloved by an obsessive subset of the nation , got a nomination—for wild , but because it seemed like one of the big narratives of the year , a much-maligned-and-gossiped-about comedy star getting the big , unexpected dramatic accolade . but , it didn ’ t the nominations this year feel so wrong ? let ’ s start with the silly stuff . after she snagged golden globe and sag nominations , we in the oscar-predicting business thought that jennifer aniston was for sure going to get nominated for cake . not because it was such a groundbreaking performance , marion cotillard , won some big critics prizes for her performance in two days , one night ( and in the immigrant , which this nomination seems to also essentially be recognizing . )
