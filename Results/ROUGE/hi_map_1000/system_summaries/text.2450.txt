a pilot study failed to show something many people believe that drinking raw milk reduces the symptoms of lactose intolerance or malabsorption , reports the new york daily news . " these data do not support the widespread claim that raw milk confers benefits in reducing the discomfort of lactose in them , " says a professor of medicine at the conclusion of their research published in annals of family medicine . " but i liked the idea of taking this on since it seemed like a relatively straightforward and answerable question . i 'm one of the estimated three million people in the uk for whom a glass of cow juice is about as welcome as being force-fed cod liver oil . much to my regret , i only discovered that i had the condition last month . " the study notes that the study was a condition in which the body has difficulty in absorbing the sugar that is commonly found in milk . " when i heard that claim it didn â€™ t make sense to me because , regardless of the bacteria , raw milk and pasteurized milk have the same amount of lactose , " the researchers write . " i can identify strongly with this mesolithic milk dodger , as i too suffer from lactose . "
