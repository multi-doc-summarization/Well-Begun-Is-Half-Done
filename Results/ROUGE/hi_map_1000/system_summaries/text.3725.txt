president trump ignited eleventh-hour confusion friday over republican efforts to push immigration legislation through the house , saying he would n't sign a " moderate " package . the white house on friday evening walked back donald trump 's criticism of a house gop bill shielding dreamers from deportation , with white house input . only the compromise bill would open a door to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the u.s. illegally as children , and reduce the separation of children from their parents when families are detained crossing the border â€” a practice that has drawn bipartisan condemnation in recent days . " the president fully supports both the goodlatte bill and the house leadership bill , " shah said , referring to a conservative daca plan that 's expected to fail for a bill that includes a pathway to house leaders hoping to pass the text next week . " i 'm looking at both of them , " trump said , per the washington post . " would have forced votes on a handful of bills and likely led to house passage of liberal-leaning versions party leaders oppose . " trump , he added , " would sign either . "
