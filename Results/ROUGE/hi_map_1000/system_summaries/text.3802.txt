lady gaga literally took a leap of faith in the us a look at five of the very best ski lodges when she opened her super bowl halftime performance with a riff on patriotic classics . after her epic ( and already memed ) dive toward the stage , our lady fearlessly sang her anthe , " we have no discussions about her or with her that have to do with the election , or the president . what we say to every artist , very clearly , and they all buy in unifying america . you ’ ll have to ask america when it 's over . but the only statements that i ’ ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that i 've been consistently making throughout my career . … i want to hold ’ em like they do in texas. ” one of those hits was “ born this way , ” her dance-floor anthem of the pledge of allegiance . wearing a shiny , silvery , big-shouldered sci-fi bodysuit and matching high-heeled boots , with a glittery mask painted around her eyes , lady gaga was lowered through the air , on suspension cables , into nrg stadium in houston , showing off a trapeze-like flip . and she started belting her hits . if ever there were a time for " yas gaga , " this was it . so i tweeted this : and was almost immediately met with this : i 'm sorry — but did the trolls on twitter miss the memo ? clearly , many of her fans were curious if the singer would get political during her 13-minute set .
