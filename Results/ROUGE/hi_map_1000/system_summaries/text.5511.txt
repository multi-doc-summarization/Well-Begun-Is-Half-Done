two dogs in the flint area recently tested positive for lead toxicity , according to the state veterinarian . the dogs with lead toxicity are both cross-breeds , and they 're both still alive , said dr. james averill , state veterinarian and animal industry division director for the michigan department of agriculture and rural development . one is a pet , and the other was a stray . their test results were confirmed in october 2015 and january 2016 , but state officials declined to release further details about the cases . " the confidentiality of the owners is like medical information in humans , " says david carswell . " what we do is we rely on the veterinarians who have the boots on the ground that are interacting with their clients and looking at the patients in front of them . when they are concerned or suspect a lead toxicity may be possible , they let us know at that time and then we work with them moving forward from there. . " averill says the first sign that your pet might be suffering from lead poisoning is any deviation from their normal behavior . " i think the key thing is , as pet owners you know what is the normal routine for your pet , " he said . " so number one , get your water tested to see if you have high lead levels . two , if necessary , get a filter in place and then water your pets through that filtered water . "
