a new high last night with the midnight of genomics for cancer , pain and inflammatory diseases , called agencourt personal genomics , the new york times reports . a year later , mckernan , 38 , has quit his job , formed a startup run from his house in marblehead , massachusetts , and announced today that the company had sequenced the entire genome of the cannabis plant . " this is the beginning of a more scientific approach to the genetics of the species , " he says . " it may be possible through genome directed breeding to attenuate the psychoactive effects of cannabis , while enhancing the medicinal aspects. . " mckernan says he 's " going to come through genetics and fingerprinting of which strains are approved. , " per the university of california , san francisco , and the human genome sequencing center at the baylor college of medicine in houston . " these pathways can be optimized in the plant or cloned into other hosts for more efficient biologic production , " says a professor of medicine . " and regulation is that some enthusiast out there will look into that possibility if the company follows through on its pledge to make genome annotations have not yet undergone the important and arduous process of being assembled into contiguous chunks . for now , the sequence is fragmented into hundreds of thousands of snippets .
