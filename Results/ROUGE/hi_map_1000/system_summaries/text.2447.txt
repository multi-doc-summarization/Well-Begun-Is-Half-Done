a pill that switches off hunger is on the horizon after scientists discovered an " anti-appetite â€™ molecule which tells the body to stop eating . researchers at imperial college discovered that people feel full when eating fruit and vegetables because fibre releases into the gut , " the ap reports . " there has been lots of epidemiological information showing a relationship between fibre and obesity , but no one has been able to connect the epidemiological results with actual mechanisms , " jimmy bell , a biochemist in imperial college london who worked on the research , published today in nature communications1 . until now , a high-fibre diet was thought to help keep weight down by stimulating the release of appetite-suppressing hormones in the gut2 , says bell , but humans do not seem to show the same increase in these hormones that mice do . so bell and his colleagues decided to look elsewhere . an obvious candidate , they thought , might be one of the products of fibre food , which does not react with gut bacteria to produce acetate . they fed mice a diet high in fat with additional inulin . these mice ate less and gained less weight than mice who did not consume inulin , and when the scientists took a deeper look , they discovered that the inulin-eating mice had higher levels of acetate in their gut . so , they used pet scans to track the inulin through the mice .
