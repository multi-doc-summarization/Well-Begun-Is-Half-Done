president trump escalated his attacks on attorney general jeff sessions on monday , suggesting the department of justice put republicans in midterm jeopardy with recent indictments of two gop congressmen . in his latest broadside against the justice department 's traditional independence , trump tweeted that " obama era investigations , of two very popular republican congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge , just ahead of the mid-terms , by the jeff sessions justice department . " he added : " two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time . good job jeff ... ... " the president 's striking suggestion when making decisions showed his disregard for the agency 's independence . trump has frequently suggested he views justice less as a law enforcement agency and more as a department that is supposed to do his personal and political bidding . still , investigators are never supposed to take into account the political affiliations of the people they investigate . trump , who did not address the specifics of the charges , did not name the republicans . but he was apparently referring to the first two republicans to endorse him in the gop presidential primaries . both were indicted on separate charges last month : rep. duncan hunter of california on charges that included spending campaign funds for personal expenses and rep. chris collins of new york on insider trading . both seats appear likely to remain in gop hands , but the charges have raised democratic hopes .
