the federal reserve 's federal open market committee on wednesday left its key interest rate at an historic low range of 0 % to 0.25 % and said its $ 600 billion bond-buying program would end as scheduled on june 30 . inflation has picked up and the fed now says the economic recovery is proceeding at " a moderate pace , " but the central bank still said the inflation pickup will be temporary and the jobs market is still a concern . the decisions were widely expected . the fomc made only few changes to the language of the policy statement it issued in march and did not give guidance on the outlook of policy after the end of quantitative easing . the fed will also release its updated economic forecasts for 2011 and 2012 just before the press conference begins . " the consequences of being too aggressive and creating an inflationary spiral are not a good argument against that option , " he writes . " it could announce that it would keep its benchmark rate at zero for a few years , which would probably hold down long-term rates . " he has been hesitant with higher inflation for a limited period of time , given how low inflation has been since 2007 and how high unemployment is . above all , they don â€™ t have enough power to keep mr. bernanke from pursuing the policy he thinks is best .
