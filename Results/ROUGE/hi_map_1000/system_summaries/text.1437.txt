a black hole pulling gas away from a companion star in search of the smallest thing in the universe has evolved along with humanity . " this time we have n't been able to see any evidence at all that there 's anything inside quarks , " physicist andy parker tells livescience . " most likely they are maybe a million million times or even more than that smaller than the distances we 've seen so far . " scientists say the atom was discovered , and it was thought indivisible of sand were the building blocks of what we see around us . " it corresponds to the distance where the gravitational field is so strong that it can start to do things like make black holes out of the energy of the field , " he said . " at the planck length we expect quantum gravity takes over . " the theory of black holes will be revealed , but it 's not clear if they are the smallest bits of time and space . scientists say they 'll be able to be separated by the minimum size of superstrings , if they exist .
