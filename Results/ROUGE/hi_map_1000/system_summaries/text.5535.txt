a memorial in a remote corner of massachusetts that marks a 1969 ufo sighting has been ordered moved , but one man who experienced a close encounter is objecting . the 5,000-pound ( 2,300-kilogram ) memorial in sheffield was installed in 2015 , but was moved about 30 feet ( 9 meters ) a few weeks later when it was discovered it was on town land . now , town administrator rhonda labombard tells the berkshire eagle it has to be moved again because it 's on a town right-of-way easement . that 's not sitting well with thom reed . he was 9 when he , his mother , grandmother and brother saw what he described as a " self-contained glow " behind them that seemed to move through the trees . once the car was in a clearing , reed said , it was flooded in light with an amber glow on both sides of the dirt road . the dead silence was broken by a chorus donated by reed and the international ufo museum research center in roswell when he and others say they had their close encounter . " it 's kind of on town property and no one decided it could go there , " labombard said . " the town has bylaws and if we let one place put something up then why ca n't someone else ? i do n't want that to happen . "
