the man who claimed to be part of the downtown hotel 's bar and restaurant operations in 1995 , mr. seger declared that he had discovered a recipe for a pre-prohibition cocktail that was once the hotel 's signature drink . adam seger , former director of restaurants for the seelbach hotel , said that the cocktail " has certainly been a tradition of the hotel and will remain part of its future , " he said . " to be honest , i always suspected that adam had created the drink , but i really , really loved it , his story was almost plausible , and i needed the hotel needed a signature cocktail . how could you have a place that f. scott fitzgerald hung out in that doesn â€™ t have a damn cocktail . " he also admitted to show the old menu with the cocktail in it . he tested it , liked it and put it on the menu . " i had no previous accolades in the bar world . i knew i could make a great drink . i wanted it to be this promotion for the hotel , " says a hotel official . the hotel story , however , says it 's not clear whether he was the man behind the seelbach cocktail . he says he was " nobody , " and that he 's not sure about the hotel .
