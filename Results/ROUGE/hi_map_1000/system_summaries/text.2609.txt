the supreme court rejected the trump administration 's request friday to stop a lawsuit brought by youths who are seeking to hold the government accountable for failing to do enough to fight climate change . the administration had asked the court to halt the lawsuit , saying it was " misguided " and a " radical invasion of the separation of powers . " " the court appears to have coalesced around a narrow compromise to defuse , for the moment , major litigation against us and national governments and corporations since the late 1980s , " he said . " the youth of our nation won an important decision today from the us court that shows even the most powerful government in the world must follow the rules and process of litigation in our democracy , " julia olson , co-counsel for the plaintiffs , in a statement reacting of the government . justices clarence thomas and neil gorsuch said they would have ruled in favor of the administration . " we â€™ ve been confident throughout this case that we would get to trial that the government can still try to stop this case from going forward , " said cnn supreme court analyst and a professor at the university of texas law school . " there is based on an assortment of unprecedented legal theories , such as a substantive due process right to certain climate conditions , and an equal protection right to live in the same climate as enjoyed by prior .
