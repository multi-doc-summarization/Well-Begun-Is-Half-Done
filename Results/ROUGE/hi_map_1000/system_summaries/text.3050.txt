two months before an alligator killed a toddler at walt disney world , firefighters were warned to stop feeding the reptiles at one of the resort 's fire stations . the admonitions were in emails from employees at reedy creek emergency services . the attack took place at grand floridian resort & spa , the ap reports . the emails were obtained through a public-records request made after an alligator snatched 2-year-old lane graves from the shore of the seven seas lagoon on june 14 and drowned him while he was on vacation with family from nebraska . one employee at the resort said at the time there was a problem with guests feeding the animals . feeding alligators is illegal because it causes the animals to lose their natural fear of humans . " you would think that the firefighters would be a little bit more in tune with the trouble that could cause and not do it , " said david hitzig , executive director of the busch wildlife center , a refuge and nature center in jupiter . " they are not docile gators , they are mean and they are out looking for food because people are feeding them . it 's getting uncomfortable . "
