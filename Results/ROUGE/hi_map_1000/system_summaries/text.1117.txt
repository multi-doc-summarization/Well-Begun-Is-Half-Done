a good night 's sleep can be transformative in the sleep group recalled an average of 10 word pairs on their first attempt , reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether sleep-dependent sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention . sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy , but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy . the other half learned in the evening of one day , slept , and then continued cycling through the entire list until they could recall all pairs perfectly . thus , by the time the relearning session was complete , any word pair that had been forgotten in the intervening 12 hours had been practiced until it could be correctly recalled once more . during two sessions occurring 12 hr apart , 40 participants practiced a list of 12 hours that did or did not include sleep , and were tested on their memory for the word pairs after one week and after six months . each and other findings are generating great excitement among sleep researchers , as well as prompting heated debates about the degree to which sleep may or may not be involved in learning . to date , most sleep and learning research has focused on recall , which is the capacity to remember information .
