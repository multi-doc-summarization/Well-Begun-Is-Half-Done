eric cantor has been set to come to the capitol for the third consecutive day of talks , but that meeting has been called off after cantor 's decision , a house democratic aide said . cantor said he was leaving the talks because of the insistence of democrats for including tax increases in a deal to cut deficits while raising the debt ceiling . in a statement , cantor called on president obama to “ resolve the tax issue , ” and said he would not take part in a meeting of the group on thursday . the group was set to meet for the 11 th time this afternoon with vice president biden , first saying that he wanted greater involvement by the president and then insisting that he remained committed to the talks led by vice president joe biden . his decision now appeared to catch some in the gop leadership , including his fellow negotiator kyl , by surprise . and cantor made his move just hours after a wednesday night meeting at the white house between his sometimes rival , speaker john boehner , mcconnell followed up by portraying obama as a champion of higher taxes at the expense of “ a bipartisan plan to address our deficit . he can ’ t have both . but we need to hear from him. ”
