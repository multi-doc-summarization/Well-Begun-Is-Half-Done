the loch ness monster lives in a giant carpenter 's level on the nearby north sea . the motion is so subtle gps could n't even track it . when the tide comes in the loch acts like a bowl of water on a wobbly table , sloshing according to the movement of the loch changed by 1.5 millimeters ( 0.06 inches ) at its different ends depending on whether the north sea tide was in or not , according to researchers at the national oceanography center in the uk and the university of porto , portugal . blog : deep icelandic current confirmed these measurements may be a first for a european lake with land shifting tides due to ocean tidal loading . " our tilt accuracy of better than 10âˆ’8 , measured over 35 km , demonstrates loch ness as one the world 's longest and most accurate tiltmeters , " the researchers said in the abstract of their paper published in the journal of geophysical research . blog , giant lost island found on atlantic seafloor the researchers used pressure sensors changes to the incredible accuracy of 0.1 mm ( 0.004 in ) over the 35 km ( 22 mi ) length .
