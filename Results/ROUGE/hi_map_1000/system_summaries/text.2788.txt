italian scientists are set to go on trial today , accused of manslaughter by playing down the risks of the devastating 2009 earthquake in the central city of l'aquila in a case that some see as an unfair indictment of science . prosecutors allege the defendants gave a falsely reassuring statement before the quake after studying hundreds of tremors that had shaken the city . the experts are accused of giving overly reassuring information to the local residents who could have taken adequate protective measures if they had been properly informed . " i thought it was important to be here because this is my land , and i also wanted to underline the professionalism and the quality of the other public officials , " said alfredo de bernardinis , former vice-president of the civil protection agency 's technical department . " this is a trial which opens on very shaky foundations . you can not put science on trial , " he said . " we simply want justice . " the seven include such prominent scientists as enzo boschi , until recently the president of italy 's national institute of geophysics and volcanology ( ingv ) , or claudio eva , a physics professor at the university of genoa .
