president yahya jammeh has told the people of his tiny west african nation that by the middle of september all those already sentenced to death for crimes will be executed . he added that crimes like banditry , drug trafficking or illicit use , homosexuality , murder , terrorism and other subversive activities against either the state or the people will not be tolerated . jammeh said in a speech on state media sunday that was rebroadcast monday . " all those guilty of serious crimes and are condemned will face the full force of the law , " he said . " any attempt to carry out this threat would be both deeply shocking and a major setback for human rights in gambia . " jammeh 's comments are deeply troubling and will undoubtedly cause severe anguish to those on death row and their families , " jammeh said . jammeh , a former military officer who seized power in a 1994 coup , brooks no dissent in a country often blasted by rights bodies for abuses . it 's unclear whether the law still stands . amnesty international , the french government and other rights groups condemned the execution order .
