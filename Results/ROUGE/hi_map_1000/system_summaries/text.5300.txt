evolution and genetics seem to have baked a certain amount of murder into humans as a species , but civilization has tamed some of the savage beast in us , according to a new study . scientists calculated the rate at which more than 1,000 mammal species kill their own kind , and noticed how closely related species have similar rates of lethal violence . they essentially found that where a species is on evolutionary tree of life tells a lot about how violent the species is to its own kind . and we 're in a rough neighborhood . humans are " in a position within a particularly violent mammalian clade , in which violence seems to have been ancestrally present , " the study in the journal nature says . that means that based on other rather murderous species closely related to us , humans have " inherited their propensity for violence . " as a group , mammals average a lethal violence rate against their own of about three killings of their own species in 1,000 deaths . the " root " violence rate of early humans and many of our closer primate cousins is about 20 in 1,000 , said study lead author jose maria gomez at the university of reading , who was not involved in the research . but , the authors add , the impact of society can greatly modify how aggressive humans are , with the proportion of human deaths due to people fighting between themselves fluctuating and laws .
