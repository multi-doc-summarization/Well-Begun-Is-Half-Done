the carolina panthers placed defensive end greg hardy on the inactive list for sunday 's home opener against the detroit lions . the move came two days after coach ron rivera said he planned to start the 2013 pro bowl selection , who was found guilty in july by a mecklenburg county judge of assaulting and threatening ex-girlfriend nicole holder . " i made the decision this morning . it was my decision because it was in the best interest of the carolina , " he said . " he 's one of the guys that makes our defense run . we feel we definitely are a better defense with him on the field . that â€™ s not about one man around here . for us , the biggest thing is not to get caught up in all the sensationalism and really let the facts play out before we start passing judgment and having opinions about it publicly . " rivera said hardy will return to the lineup , and he limited the number of questions on hardy . rivera said the league is dealing with difficult issues and so are the panthers . he stressed letting the panthers ' locker room said they want hardy back on their field . asked how they balance that between the public outcry for him not to be allowed to play , center ryan kalil tried to put it into perspective .
