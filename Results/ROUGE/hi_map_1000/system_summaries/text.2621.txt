the world got its first glimpse of the nike air mag in 1989 , when marty mcfly sported a pair in back to the future . in the intervening 27 years , there ’ s been plenty of speculation about when ( and if ) science fiction would ever become fact . then , last fall , nike casually dropped a bomb : yes , power-lacing shoes were possible . in fact , not only were they possible , they were actually going to be something you and i could buy sometime in the near future . it appears that the future is suddenly the present , because today nike announced that its first pair of self-lacing shoes will be hitting stores later this year ( price to be a risk factor ) . " it reads if you 're gon na have to charge your shoes , just like you charge your phone and fitbit . but come on . it 's a compelling vision for sure , but as with all technology there are potential tradeoffs . traditional laces are reliable—you 'll never have to worry about them running out of juice or malfunctioning during a pivotal moment . any time a shoe 's functionality is tied directly to technology , there 's going to how this technology can improve and adapt to create a hyper-personalized platform . he would n't give much away , but hoke did say that , eventually , you could imagine how your shoe might gather biometric data that can be fed into an entire adaptable , reactive ecosystem of nike wearables .
