" what we do is do away with the straw man provision , where you can buy a gun legally and then sell it to somebody who 's a criminal . i think what we also is significantly expand mental health capabilities to try to address the fact that we have thousands of people walking in this country today who are suicidal and homicidal . so i 've talked about it , you have seen it . what the agenda is so deeply embedded in new york 's identity and so many different kinds of people use it , the token by symbolizing the subway comes to symbolize the city . " the subway , which is run by the roosevelt island operating corporation , will save $ 6 million a year in handling costs . " in this time of dwindling resources , the shift away from tokens will allow us to be more efficient , " he said . " i always carry a few with me , mostly for the times my metrocard wo n't swipe ... .why ca n't we get dependable readers , like those in other cities . "
