" i had been praying about it for years , trying to seek god 's will for my life and not really finding it in any of the paths that i sought before , " she said . " it was really a consideration of which things brought me the most joy and where my greatest happiness was . it seemed that all of those loves converged on this one thing where i think i 've probably changed my mind very many times . i had to really consider the appropriateness of the occasion for my dress . i wanted my shoulders to be covered , and i would have to lie prostrate before the altar , so i really wanted to make sure that i was well-covered in a way that still shows the beauty of a bride .
