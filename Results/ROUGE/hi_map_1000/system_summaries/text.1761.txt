hawaii 's governor is asking president donald trump to declare the state a disaster because of earthquakes and a volcanic eruption on the big island . gov . david ige said thursday the disaster is so severe that direct federal help is needed . state officials estimate it will cost more than $ 2.9 million to protect residents over the next 30 days . the costs will skyrocket if there needs to be large-scale air and sea evacuations . two subdivisions were ordered to evacuate last week after lava oozed from cracks in the ground , burning down some two dozen homes . ige county authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas , which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities . " it ’ s just horrible . you can ’ t breathe in there , " said evacuated resident robynn stagg , 58 , who drove through the thick , orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home . hawaii ’ s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the air , including sulfur dioxide , according to the u.s. environmental protection agency .
