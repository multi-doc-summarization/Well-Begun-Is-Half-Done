antarctic scientists wildly underestimated the number of adélie penguins in just one part of antarctica in east antarctica , more than double the number previously thought , scientists say wednesday in findings that have implications for conservation . research by an australian , french and japanese team used aerial and ground surveys , tagging and resighting data and automated camera images over several breeding seasons , which allowed them to come up with the new figure . adélies were named after the wife of an 1840s french explorer . unlike most other penguin species , they live only on the frozen continent and nearby small islands . " there are currently nine permanently occupied research stations in the ice-free areas of east antarctica and we found over one million birds breed within 10 kilometres of a station , " he said . " the non-breeders are essentially an invisible component of the population . the breeders are very well behaved . they come to the islands and sit around on eggs and we can count them easily . but these non-breeders are foraging out in the water where we ca n't see them . they may visit from time to time but they are essentially invisible to us .
