drivers who drink coffee behind the wheel do n't need to worry about getting a ticket in new jersey any time soon . the sponsor of a bill targeting distracted driving says his measure does n't specifically cite coffee , despite recent news reports focusing on the beverage . democratic assemblyman john wisniewski said the legislation is aimed at discouraging distracted driving and that he can not imagine that a police officer would pull anyone over for drinking coffee . current law already prohibits texting or talking without paying attention to the road.the proposed fines for violators are $ 200 to $ 400 for the first offense and a $ 400 to $ 600 fine for a second offense . a third or subsequent offense could mean a fine of $ 600 to $ 800 and up to a 90 day license suspension , as well as motor vehicle points . " this proposed distracted driving law is not needed , since three statutes can be used when a distraction causes unsafe actions , like swerving or crossing a line , " said steve carrellas , policy and government affairs director for the national motorists association state chapter . " there is unsafe driving , careless driving and reckless driving . "
