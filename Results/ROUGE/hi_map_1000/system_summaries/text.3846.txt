a simple gesture of kindness got a helping hand while renting a car last week after hers was damaged in a hit-and-run accident , the ap reports . vincent literally had both hands full with the boys , so goodlett just picked one of them up while he continued to help vincent get a rental vehicle . a picture of goodlett holding the toddler went viral on facebook and has been shared almost 25,000 times . in the post , vincent said goodlett knows a thing or two about twins . " so i kind of moseyed on over to where he was working , playing with one son while he ’ s done it his whole life , " he says . " but i hope it helps get the message out that this is the way people are supposed to treat each other every day . we could all help each other and be a little friendlier. ” " it 's kind of shocking to see the world took it as such a big motion , " she said . " it just makes you wonder : what did i do so special ? this was something that ’ s part of my instinctual way to do . "
