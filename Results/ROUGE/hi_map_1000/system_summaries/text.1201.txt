a mother is upset after her 5-year-old son received detention for what his school is calling " sexual misconduct. " eric lopez , a kindergartner at ashton ranch elementary school , pulled his pants down on the playground . the mother said that her son is too young to understand what sexual misconduct means and that he pulled down his pants , exposing himself , not out of sexual intent but because he was intimidated by another student . she said her son was asked to sign the referral form , which was to stay in his student record while he is a student in the dysart unified school district . the boy was given a one-day agreement with the district that removed the sexual-misconduct categorization from the boy 's record . tashia abry , assistant research professor at arizona state university 's t. denny sanford school of social and family dynamics , said the incident raises serious questions . " the discussion with a kindergarten student is focused on the specific action , not on the label that is used for classifying the infraction , " he said . " that 's a question worth asking and that we should be asking ourselves , because this is a child 's school record , and it 's not something to be taken lightly . "
