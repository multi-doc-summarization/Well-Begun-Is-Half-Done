a string of government airstrikes on rebel areas in the country 's north has killed at least 20 people , leveled buildings and forced residents to dig through mounds of rubble in search of survivors . the activists say the strikes happened late wednesday and early thursday and hit a total of four towns in idlib and aleppo provinces . they say residents are searching through the rubble in some of the towns , while in others the dead were buried before being identified . videos rose as the hours passed . it is never good to be out after dark in damascus now , especially trapped in a traffic jam , unable to flee . finally , rifa â€™ s husband called again . they had escaped and returned to their workplace to pass the night , another concession to their changing world . war has come to damascus . not on the scale of aleppo or homs , at least not yet . but the difference from just a few months ago is unmistakable . with sandbagged checkpoints every half-mile and soldiers methodically searching vehicles for weapons , hoping to ride out the turmoil , which is now in its 19th month and is only getting worse as rebels and regime forces tear apart the country in their fight for power .
