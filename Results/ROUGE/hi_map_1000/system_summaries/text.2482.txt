on-demand companies uber and lyft suffered an embarrassing defeat in a saturday election in austin as voters backed a measure requiring fingerprint background checks for drivers . campaign signs concerning a municipal vote over fingerprint requirements , and when the votes were tallied their campaign contributions broke down to being more than $ 200 for each vote in favor of their position . " disappointment does not begin to describe how we feel about shutting down operations in austin , " uber 's austin general manager chris nakutis said in a statement , per reuters . " no matter what , the outcome will be mixed . opponents to proposition 1 are happy that companies which do operate should have a stricter vetting process that reduces the chances of drivers committing crimes . it also pleases emergency crews worried that they 'll have to dodge around mid-street pickups . however , it 's doubtful that either of the companies will be so quick to come back . both tend to play hardball when new laws make life difficult , often by threatening to end service -- they give up their main bargaining chip if they do n't follow through on that threat . sure enough , lyft says this is taking a <unk> city , and going without ridesharing means either paying much more for a cab or else using a mass transit system that 's far from ideal . and of course , drivers who made significant cash through these services now have to scramble to find other work .
