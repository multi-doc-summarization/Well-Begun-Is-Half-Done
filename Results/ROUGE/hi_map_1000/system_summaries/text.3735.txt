ron 'megatoad ' stonie , one of major league eating 's top two eaters in the world , just set the bacon-eating record by housing 182 slices eating record set in west palm beach on feb. 14 , the ap reports . eating competitively is his job , and when he 's stuffing his face on stage , he does n't taste food the same . " i feel the texture , i taste the saltiness , and i focus on getting it all down . it ca n't be too crispy and if it 's not warm when i get it , the fat coagulates into lard , " he tells huffpost . " it needs to be cooked perfectly . " mle has n't ever sponsored a true bacon-eating contest before , and for comparison 's sake , unofficial eating groups show a measly 54 pieces of bacon as the previous " record . " " the bacon was cooked just the way i like it -- a little crispy because i do n't like having to chew it , " stonie tells huffpost weird news . " but i love bacon , it goes with everything . "
