rupert murdoch has met rebekah brooks over the phone-hacking scandal news international found e-mails in 2007 that appeared to indicate that payments were being made to the police for information , although this evidence of alleged criminal behaviour was not handed to scotland yard until last month , the ap reports . the former cop , who now works as a private investigator , said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their ­relatives . 'his presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the ­relevant voicemails , just like it has been shown they have done in the uk . the voicemails are likely to have included harrowing messages from distraught relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones in the wake of the terrorist attacks in new york in 2001 . a source told the daily mirror : 'this investigator is used by a lot of journalists in america and he recently told me that he was asked to hack the voicemails of dead 9/11 victims , a former new york policeman claimed last night . he alleged he was contacted by news international to review whether the emails do not identify police officers by name . they also appear to show that phone hacking went wider than the activities of a single rogue reporter , which was the news of the world 's claim at the time .
