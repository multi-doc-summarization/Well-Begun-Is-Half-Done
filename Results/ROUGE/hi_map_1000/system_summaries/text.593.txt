a seriously ill woman denied a medical abortion has had a successful cesarean section to deliver a baby that doctors have given little chance of surviving , el salvador 's health ministry announced late on monday . the 22-year-old woman , known only as beatriz for privacy reasons , underwent the operation in the afternoon after 27 weeks of pregnancy , the ministry says . her baby girl was born without a brain . " she 's in good hands , being looked after well , " she told reuters . " i expect things to go well over the next few hours . " the country 's supreme court last week prohibited an abortion for beatriz , who suffers from lupus and kidney failure and whose lawyers said the pregnancy was threatening her life . her plight drew international attention and a ruling from the inter-american court on human rights that el salvador should protect her life and help her end the pregnancy . the health ministry can determine what is most medically sound for a mother versus the unborn baby and was lauded internationally for working to save the woman 's life . doctors at the maternity hospital had been preparing to perform the c-section .
