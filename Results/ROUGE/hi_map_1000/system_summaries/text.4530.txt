the price of the electronic currency bitcoin continues to soar in bitcoin are now 44 percent off its intraday high of $ 266 , the new york times reports . bitcoin is now 44 % of its value from the peak , the ap reports . the virtual currency has seen a remarkable rise since january , and walked away with an envelope full of cash . the odd amount was deliberate ; i had been instructed by localtill to be exact in everything i did . what ’ s localtill ? don ’ t bother googling it—its shady-looking website offers only murky in recent weeks , which is a return that more than justifies the risk they took of potentially losing everything . ( as long as the chance of each outcome is roughly the same , downside of 100 % and upside of 600 % is a great bet . ) like the assets at the center of most powerful asset bubbles , you can dispute the transaction and in most cases the bank or the merchant , not the customer , will cover the cost . that 's convenient for consumers , but it requires the financial system to be a fairly close-knit web of trust . allowing a new member into the club creates risks for everyone else . so the incumbents are understandably reluctant to deal with anyone who is n't well-known and well-capitalized . bitcoin may be a bubble . someday , bitcoin prices may come crashing down , causing the suckers who own them then to lose their shirts .
