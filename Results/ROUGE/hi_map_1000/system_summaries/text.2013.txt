iraq 's new president on monday asked a veteran shiite politician , haider al-abadi , to form a new government , setting the stage for a vicious political showdown in a country already struggling to contain an islamist extremist insurgency . as his already limited political support crumbled , the incumbent prime minister , a coalition of shiite parties that al-maliki 's state of law is part of , but has turned against him . al-maliki 's shiite-dominated bloc won the most parliament seats in april elections and the prime minister sees himself as rightfully keeping the post . in a midnight speech , al-maliki said he was filing a suit against the president for neglecting to name him prime minister by sunday 's deadline and all but demanded to the kurdish region of iraq with the help of syrian kurdish forces . ominously , maliki reminded the country in a televised address monday of his position as head of the armed forces and assured it to parliament for approval , expressing his hope he would succeed . for a second day , blue-and-white armored personnel carriers belonging to security forces that answer directly to maliki were stationed around the green zone . a hulking tank sat at one of the entrances to the secured zone , which houses government buildings .
