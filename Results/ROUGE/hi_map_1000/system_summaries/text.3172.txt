president obama blames the press for creating the image that he 's just more interested in spending time with his family than in exchanging pleasantries with strangers . " my suspicion is that this whole critique has to do with the fact that i don ’ t go to a lot of washington parties and , as a consequence , the washington press corps maybe just doesn ’ t feel like i ’ m in the mix enough with them , and we want to be good parents at a time that ’ s vitally important for our kids . " jodi kantor , boehner 's press secretary , challenged obama 's assessment . " the problem has n't been getting our team to do what is responsible . it is true that i 'm always cautious about comparing what we ’ ve done to what others have done , just because each period is unique . but what i can say is that i made a commitment to change the trajectory of american foreign policy in a way that would end the war in iraq , refocus on defeating our primary enemy , al-qaeda , strengthen our alliances and our leadership in multilateral fora and restore american leadership in the world . and i think we have accomplished those principal goals . bush ’ s foreign policy , and i continue to believe that he had trouble getting his caucus to go along with doing the responsible thing on a whole bunch of issues over the past year .
