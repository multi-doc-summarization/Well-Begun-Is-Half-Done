pittsburgh international airport 's decision to allow non-flyers to pass through security checkpoints to access the airside terminal 's shops , restaurants , and gates . bob ross , national president of the association of professional flight attendants , said the change will decrease airport safety and lead to longer security lines , causing flyers to miss their flights . " personally , i 'm stunned by the timing of this decision , " ross said in a news release . " days prior to the anniversary of 9/11 is when we should be reminding the public of the need to remain vigilant , not sending the message that the airport is no different than their local mall. . " the airport , which is the first in the country to allow <unk> to access areas beyond security checkpoints , has their name checked against a " no fly " list and then , just like regular flyers , go through security . while the tsa said it supports pittsburgh 's change , it noted that no additional staff has been hired for the change . it also said there are no plans to expand the program .
