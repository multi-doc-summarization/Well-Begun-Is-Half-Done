sandra bullock is n't just the most beautiful woman , but sandra bullock does n't take herself too seriously when it comes to her 5-year-old son , bullock , 50 , insists she heard about the honor . " no , really . i just said , 'that 's ridiculous , ' " she tells people . " i would never tell you to work out six times a week for two hours a day to get results … or promise that you ’ ll lose ten pounds in a week if you do as i say . that ’ s crazy talk ! and it ’ s not sustainable . with bbs you will learn how to make exercise and healthy eating a way of life instead of drudgery . i was putting him to bed and told him that even when i 'm old and gray and more wrinkly than i am now , i 'll still love him and want to tuck him in , " she says . " when i started , i could barely do 20 seconds , and i 'm not kidding . i 'm crying on the floor , and she 's like , 'are you a smoker ? ' i was like , ' i hate you . "
