the defense of george zimmerman rests on a violent fight that he said occurred before he fired the shot that killed trayvon martin . zimmerman is neighborhood watch volunteer at the center of the case . it was almost five weeks that martin , the unarmed 17-year-old , was killed after zimmerman found him suspicious . we do n't know what happened immediately immediately before the shot was fired . cbs news correspondent mark strassman has new evidence in the case , but otherwise , according to richard kurtz , the funeral director who prepared martin for burial , his body showed no injuries . " we could see no physical signs like there had been a scuffle [ or ] do not believe it was self-defense and we need to prove it , " he said . " do you see any blood on his head ? he said he broke his nose . look at that video . and look at how easy he walks out of the car . " police reports noted zimmerman was " bleeding from the nose and the back of the head . trayvon martin got on top of him and just started beating him in the face and in the nose , hitting his head on the concrete .
