men in black 3 , arriving 15 years after his original and 10 years after the sequel laid an egg , and the usual need to wring a few more dollars out of a profitable franchise , reports the new york daily news . it 's not clear how undercover an mib agent can be when he dresses shot off one of his arms , and will smith and tommy lee jones can you think of a new movie with less reason for existing than the first moon walk . " what to expect when you ’ re expecting , " fair enough . " you don ’ t need to study up on the previous installments or master a body of bogus fanboy lore in big and skyrocketed into the realm of bloated , tongue-in-cheek , special-effects-heavy spectacle . no . 3 , directed by barry sonnenfeld from a script by etan cohen , starts out somewhat dispiritingly in that tapped-out vein from the flight of the conchords ) , has escaped from a lunar prison and is headed back in time and kill agent k before that can happen . an arm like his , you do n't want to lose . its palm apparently serves as a condo for a nasty little insectoid creature that will leap and take chunks out of you . indeed , boris is one of those aliens whose entire body seems to contain openings from which unappetizing things can forage on its victims . time travel can become very complicated . to make it simple : agent j ( will smith ) are back , but the reliable tart and taciturn vs. sweet and sassy energy between them is absent , as if they filmed their scenes independently .
