" i ca n't easily rush to the space , " nasa wrote . " it ’ s a $ 30,000 incentive prize for a nasa-worthy system for spacesuits that routes human waste away from the body , hands-free . it could be the difference between life and death for astronauts in space . space is an extreme and unsafe environment even before you consider the issue of , um , using the bathroom . but that ’ s just it -- we have to consider that issue . so before you go running off to make space travel history by drumming up in a spacesuit , with no toilet in sight and a crew of other astronauts around , what do you do ? nasa has launched a contest for inventors to solve this uncomfortable issue , and read on for some interesting factoids about dealing with bodily functions in emergency situations that would be otherwise be broken , or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page 's authors.the goal is to fix all broken links on the web .
