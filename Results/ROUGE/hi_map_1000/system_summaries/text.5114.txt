wildlife officials in thailand have begun removing some of the 137 tigers held at a buddhist temple following accusations that the monks were involved in illegal breeding and trafficking of the animals . the director of thailand 's wildlife conservation office , teunjai noochdumrong , said three tigers were tranquilized and transported monday in an operation involving about 1,000 state personnel that is expected to continue for a week . the animals will be taken to three government animal refuges elsewhere in thailand . the temple , a popular money-earning tourist attraction in the western province of kanchanaburi , has been criticized by animal rights activists because of allegations it is not properly set up to care for the animals and flouted regulations restricting their trade . the monks recently made arrangements to operate as a zoo , but the plan fell through when the government determined that the temple failed to secure sufficient resources . " when our vet team arrived , there were tigers roaming around everywhere , " noochdumrong said . " looks like the temple intentionally let these tigers out , trying to obstruct our work . " in kanchanaburi province west of bangkok , has long been popular with tourists , who could walk among the tigers and pose for photos .
