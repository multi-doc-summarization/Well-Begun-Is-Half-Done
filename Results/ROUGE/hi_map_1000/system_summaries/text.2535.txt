kavanaugh and vocativ are now reporting that the paperwork on this case lists an incorrect last name for the man accused of urinating in the reservoir . his name is in the hot seat after surveillance video supposedly captured him taking a leak in a city reservoir early wednesday morning , prompting officials to flush 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain . for those more visually inclined , that ’ s enough h20 to fill about 57 olympic-size swimming pools . so the possibility someone getting sick because of wednesday morning 's incident is , as water bureau officials acknowledge , slight at best . “ from a public health protection standpoint , it ’ s not necessary to get rid of the water , ” he said . “ how can they be like , ‘ yeah , we ’ re gon na flush all that water. ’ dude , i ’ m going to be on the news ” he says he had moved back to town that very day from st. helens , which is 30 miles north of portland , where he had been living with his dad . eager to shred with some friends , he and two buddies went to skateboard at mount tabor park after hours .
