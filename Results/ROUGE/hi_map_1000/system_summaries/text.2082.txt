the senate judiciary committee will vote on whether to favorably recommend brett kavanaugh 's nomination to the supreme court as previously scheduled friday morning , though top gop senators did not know as of thursday night whether enough key republican votes had been convinced to confirm president trump 's nominee . kavanaugh 's supporters and critics are now closely watching a handful of key republican senators as they decide whether to support the nominee , following a day-long , blockbuster hearing that featured both kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault . the vote scheduled for friday morning means undecided gop members of the committee -- including arizona republican sen. jeff flake -- have just hours to publicly choose a side in a deeply polarizing political fight . " she seems sincere , kind , thoughtful and credible , " trump wrote . " democrats ' search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay , obstruct , and resist . the senate must vote ! " he added , " i do n't know . you have to weigh those things , you look at what more time has done in the past couple of days in term of ludicrous allegations , some of which have been recanted . others just were anonymous to begin with , and what does that do to the accused . just to give it more time .
