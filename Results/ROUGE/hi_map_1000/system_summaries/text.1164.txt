ashley judd is the daughter of naomi judd and sister to wynonna- women known as " a misogynistic assault on all women . " " i hope the sharing of my thoughts can generate a new conversation : why was a puffy face cause for such a conversation in the first place ? how , and why , did people participate ? if not in the conversation about me , in parallel ones about women in your sphere ? what is the gloating about ? what 's certainly food for thought , " he writes . " i know this , even though my personal practice is to ignore what is written about me . i arrived at this belief after first , when i began working as an actor 18 years ago , reading everything . i do not want to give my power , my self-esteem , or thing outside myself . i thus abstain from all media about myself . the only thing that matters is how i feel about myself , my personal integrity , and my relationship with my creator . of course , it â€™ s wonderful to be held in esteem and fond regard by family , friends , and community , but a central part of my spiritual practice is letting go of otheration .
