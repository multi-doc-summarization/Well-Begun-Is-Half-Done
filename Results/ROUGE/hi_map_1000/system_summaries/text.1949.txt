mcdonald 's pretty much wrote the book on how a corporation can conquer the world . but despite its global domination as a cheap and easy burger joint , the fast-food monolith proved no match against the people of bolivia and its cultural standards of culinary decency . for well over a decade mcdonald 's , with eight locations in the south american nation of 10 million people , worked to win over the bolivian public with its big macs and mcnuggets , but consistently found itself losing money . so , in light of the loss of revenue , mcdonald 's attempted to court bolivians into making a habit out of eating their processed menu items -- only to experience an overwhelming , nation-wide rejection . and as a result , for the first time ever , the cogs of mcdonald 's international burger-slinging machine have ground to a halt , forcing the company to close its doors in bolivia in 2002 . but what makes bolivia different from nearly every other country in its apparent distaste for mcdonald 's fare ? a group of filmakers have attempted to answer that question in the documentary why did mcdonald â€™ s bolivia go bankrupt ? " it 's difficult not to judge bolivia better off for having rejected a restaurant so often associated with a menu of dubious nutritional value and less-than eco-friendly business practices . "
