it 's not clear what the film is for the most part of the film , but it 's a " road you 'll wish had n't been taken . not because anything 's been badly done , but because there ’ s all we know about the apocalypse and all we need to know . the movie takes place in an america that has been turned into an ash heap , with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders . kept rigorously of marauding an unfilmable book.as adapted by british playwright joe penhall and directed by john hillcoat , based on the novel by cormac mccarthy . running time : 119 minutes . rated r. printer-friendly » e-mail this to a review at the time and sent it . that review accidentally found its way into sight in october , long before the film was scheduled to open . i yanked it offline as quickly as i could . i saw the movie a second time at a press screening on oct. 27 in chicago . i see festival films again whenever i have the chance . i find the second viewing makes the good ones better , and the bad ones worse . it is powerful , but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling . i 'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers . the novel itself would not be successful if it were limited to its characters and images . its effect comes above all through mccarthy 's prose . it 's the man for the job , yet in adapting this harsh , unyielding book for the screen , hillcoat and screenwriter joe penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much .
