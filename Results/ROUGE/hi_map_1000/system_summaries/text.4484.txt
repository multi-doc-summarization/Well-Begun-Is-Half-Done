matt white and chauncy jones may never have met , if it was n't for jones cross-town trip to the " rich people 's kroger " in search of a helping hand . white , who lives in memphis , tenn. , said in a facebook post that jones approached him at the grocery store and asked if he could carry his groceries out of the store in exchange for a box of doughnuts . " he had no phone , a bus pass , and he was depending on the graces of a stranger to feed him within the hour before the bus left , " he said . " i 'm 30 years old and i have a new hero.and he 's 16.his name is chauncy jones black , and last week , by god 's beautiful design , he met me . i 'll never forget it , here comes this kid inside the highland kroger asking ... he could help take my groceries to my car in exchange . " white drove jones to his home and was shocked when he saw the fridge was empty , and the reality of the boy 's life became more heartbreaking from there . chauncy was living with his mother in a house , but they had nothing . no furniture aside from a couch and a couple lamps . no beds ; absolutely nothing . they slept on pads made out of sleeping bags , and their refrigerator was empty . matt had given the family food and other groceries , but it can ripple out and create an ocean of prosperity in the world.the first step is to get chauncy 's basic needs covered and to get him working .
