a doctor who appears to have been the target of a former physician who started shooting at a hospital , killing one person and injuring six , said he has no idea why he would have been singled out . dr. kamran ahmed told the new york post he was n't the only one . that 's why they fired him , because so many people complained . " the strange thing was that he was nice with me , " ahmed said . " he is not only after me , he is after a lot of people . he had a problem with almost everybody , so i â€™ m not the only <unk> . i do n't know why he put my name . " a law enforcement official told the post that bello was bought in upstate new york about a week earlier , hidden under his lab coat and asked for a doctor he blamed for his having to resign , but the doctor was n't there at the time . " i was told it was because i always kept to myself , " he said , adding that he had worked with shooter henry bello , 45 , and started shooting anyway , killing dr. tracy sin-yee tam , who specializes in the early detection and treatment of dementia . " she was such a sweet girl . you would never think something like that would happen , but it happened . "
