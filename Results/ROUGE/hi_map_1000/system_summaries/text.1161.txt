a new york city man is on a mission to flush the cremated remains of his lifelong friend . like baseball , this endeavor has rules . the game has to be in progress when mcdonald sprinkles the ashes into the toilet from a little plastic bottle . so far , he 's done the deed at 16 stadiums . riegel also was a music fan : in cleveland , mcdonald flushed ashes at both progressive field and the rock & roll hall of fame . as boys , he and riegel grew up in its shadow and spent one particularly memorable season there in 1973 . mcdonald ’ s mother called him at the game to say that riegel , 48 , had passed away . he smudged them proudly onto a marker on lower broadway commemorating the city 's ticker-tape parade for the mets after their 1969 world series victory . he returned smiling and declared triumphantly , " ‘ i just took care of roy , ' " boneker recalled , adding that they resolved to try it at a minnesota twins game at the metrodome in minneapolis but , once there , realized that an indoor stadium was not an appropriate setting . afterward , at a nearby irish pub , a frustrated mr. mcdonald excused himself to use the bathroom . " i know people might think it 's weird , and if it were anyone else 's ashes , i 'd agree , " mcdonald said . " but for roy , this is the perfect tribute to a plumber and a baseball fan and just a brilliant , wild guy . "
