john thune is n't running for president . " for months now , my wife kimberley and i have received encouragement from family , friends , colleagues , and supporters from across south dakota and the country to run for the presidency of the united states , " thune said in a statement posted on his website today . " we have appreciated hearing their concerns about where the country is headed and their hopes for a new direction . and make no mistake that during this period of fiscal crisis and economic uncertainty there is a fight to be waged over what kind of country we are going to leave our children and grandchildren and that battle is happening now in washington , not two years from now . so at this time , i feel that i can make a difference . he told confidantes there are three main reasons for his decision : his role in the senate , his family and the timing . " politico notes that thune , who beat democratic majority leader tom daschle to win his senate seat in 2004 , has been speaking with thune regularly for weeks .
