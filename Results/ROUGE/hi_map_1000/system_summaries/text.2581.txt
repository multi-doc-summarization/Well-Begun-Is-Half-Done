a federal study found only a third of american men use them in a study in which the men would presumably be motivated to report accurate information about their penis size ; and to explore associations between men 's erect penile dimensions , their method of measurement , and their demographics . methods : data are from an internet-based baseline to the condom equivalent of bespoke suits . a boston-based company has begun selling custom-fit condoms in 60 sizes , in combinations of 10 lengths and nine circumferences . these include sizes smaller and larger than what was previously available to condom users in america . with 60 condom sizes , myone is designed to finally address the top complaints about condoms : they don ’ t fit and are uncomfortable . does size matter ? it 's no secret than many people don ’ ll like to use condoms . common complaints focus on issues related to fit and feel , such as the condom being too loose , tight , short or long . poor condom fit is a contributing factor to loss of sensation , loss of erection , and difficulty achieving orgasm . in one study sample of 1,661 men in the united states , 82.83 percent of participants had a penis shorter than the length of a standard condom . as a result , for many men the condom will not unroll completely , causing a rubber-band effect at the base of the penis—resulting in tightness and discomfort . if the condom does unroll , the extra length can hang off the tip of the penis and potentially cause it to slip or be pulled off .
