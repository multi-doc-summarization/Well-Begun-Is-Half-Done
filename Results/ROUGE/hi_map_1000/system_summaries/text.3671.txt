" it made me extremely upset . that was the tipping point for me . it was a build-up during the game , and seeing the swastika obviously , but the comments built up to the point where i could n't forgive myself if i let it slide . " the jewish student who suffered the injury told the guardian : " i 've seen this kind of game before , so it was n't so much the game that offended me , as much as the antisemitic gibes that went with it .
