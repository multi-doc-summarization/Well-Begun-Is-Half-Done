a blueberry farm outside of tampa , florida , on monday , ups tested the use of drones for residential delivery for the first time . the drone delivered a package directly to a home , then returned to the van which had now moved down the road to allow its driver to make another delivery . ups says the system is different from its other drone work thus far , and could make the company ’ s network more efficient while reducing emissions . " that nest that we have on top of the car would be able to be put on any car , but we have to make sure it has the capabilities and it ’ s set up to do the charging , " he explains . " it has implications for future deliveries , especially in rural locations where our package cars often have to travel miles to make a single delivery . " the drone used in monday 's test was made by ohio-based workhorse group inc. , carrying a package weighing up to 10 pounds . for this test , ups launched the vehicle from the roof of the delivery truck , and a cage suspended beneath it extends through a hatch into the vehicle . a driver on the inside loads a package into the cage , where the drone can be lowered down and loaded up with another package . while docked , the drone recharges through a physical connection between its arms and the truck ’ s electric battery .
