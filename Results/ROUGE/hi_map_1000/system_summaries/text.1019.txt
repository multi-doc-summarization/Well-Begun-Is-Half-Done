david letterman has been headed to a manhattan court on tuesday morning for the first hearing in the criminal case against him , the ap reports . the new york times reports that halderman is found guilty of attempted grand larceny , he could face up to 15 years in state prison . tuesday 's hearing will likely tackle the mundane issues involved with scheduling future proceedings , and is planning to meet with friends and advisers in the coming weeks to discuss other fund-raising possibilities . " this lawyer is a real litigator , " arnot tells the observer . " in large part , however , they will assess what the broader legal questions are that need to be resolved and likely set dates for future proceedings . watch for defense attorney gerry shargel , however . to continue his public assault on letterman 's character . he may also try to make it seem as if he wants to move forward with a trial whether that is true or not . so do n't expect any grand revelations but based on the way shargel has behaved already , i would not be surprised to hear some theatrics from the prosecution .
