the protesters are members of al qaeda libyan leader col muammar gaddafi has told the bbc he is loved by all his people and has denied there have been any protests in tripoli . col gaddafi said that his people would die to protect him . he laughed at the suggestion he would leave libya and said that he felt betrayed by the world leaders who had urged him to quit . us ambassador to the un susan rice said the interview showed col gaddafi was " delusional " and " unfit to lead . " he said he would not step down as he did not have an official position and insisted that the power was with the people . he was in a fairly relaxed mood throughout , looking as if he was relishing the biggest challenge he has had in almost 42 years as libya 's leader . but gadhafi 's version of the truth seemed to be at odds with what people have been talking about and reporting here , and he does not seem to fully comprehend the drama and the magnitude of what 's going on around him . i asked him several times about reports that aerial bombardments had been used against protesters , but gadhafi said they did not happen and that they had only bombed military and ammunition depots . he seemed to speak to the press to get the truth out , but he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story .
