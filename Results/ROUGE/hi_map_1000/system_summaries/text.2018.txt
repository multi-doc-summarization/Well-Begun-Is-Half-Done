john hawkins is spot on in detecting the sarcasm here , but if you ’ re inclined to believe that ayers is the one ’ s ghostwriter , you ’ t bound to detect a “ deeper truth ” in his tone . in fact , ayers has been baiting people with this same corny line about splitting the royalties for ages . back in october 2009 , a conservative blogger spotted him in reagan airport and approached him . as soon as she mentioned that she thought he had at least edited it , he egged her on by insisting that no , he had written the book , that michelle obama had put him up to it , and , yes , that he ’ d be happy to split the royalties with the blogger if she could prove it . when she countered that she was conservative , he offered , unprompted , that she had written a destination on yahoo ! , try visiting the yahoo ! home page or look through a list of yahoo ! 's online services . " i think he enjoys mocking people who push this idea and enjoys it doubly when they can ’ t detect the mockery , in fact . i ’ d bet that this is his stock response anytime the book is mentioned in his presence ' insisting that he wrote it to see if the listener laughs and then toying with them if they seem credulous . but as i say , your mileage may vary .
