" we can not keep ourselves shut up in parishes , in our communities , when so many people are waiting for the gospel , " francis said . " it is the only way for individuals , families and societies to grow , the only <unk> for the life of peoples to progress . " francis called for " social humility " and dialogue without directly mentioning the protests . " i hope that youth take away the courage to live their faith in a more concrete way , " says chris whitson , who help chaperon a group of 86 youths from georgia and the carolinas .
