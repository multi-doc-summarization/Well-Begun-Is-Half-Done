president obama is seriously considering circumventing congress with his executive authority and imposing the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly supply so-called " straw purchasers , " reports the washington post . " it ’ s a lot more clear today than it was a year ago how to work this out. , " he said . " you couldn ’ t say , we define ‘ engaged in the business ’ as anyone who sells a gun ever . but you could change the regulation to be more focused , more narrow , and less vague than it currently is , which makes it very hard to prosecute people who abuse the law and are selling tens and hundreds of guns as private sellers . but if clinton could do this as president , couldn ’ s campaign says that this could theoretically be accomplished via a new rule by the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms to background checks and banning almost all re-imports of military surplus firearms to peddle guns without a background check if congress doesn ’ t . clinton ’ s new plan , which she will discuss on the campaign trail today , includes a raft of ideas : closing loopholes in the background check system ; more aggressive action to revoke the position that there is little the federal government can do about it , and today , in an effort to contrast with that willfully defeatist posture , hillary clinton rolled out some concrete proposals .
