taco bell 's president and chief concept officer greg creed has released a new and more in-depth statement that goes into detail about the percentage of ingredients in the recipe , like how it contains 88 % of it is . the lawsuit is bogus and filled with completely inaccurate facts . our beef is 100 % usda inspected , just like the quality beef you would buy in a supermarket and prepare in your home . it then is slow-cooked and simmered with proprietary seasonings and spices to provide taco bell , and mickey d 's will provide . for anyone outside vermont , you still get the fake stuff . and of course , no talk of fake food would be complete without mention of " chicken " nuggets and the infamous pink goo . oh there 's chicken in there all right , but a little more than breast and wings -- like all of it , including beak and wings . there is no basis in fact or reality for this suit and we will vigorously defend the quality of our products from frivolous and misleading claims such as this . " so now there are fake claims being made about fake food ? ca n't we just get some real food around here ? it seems to be more and more difficult . for example , blueberries . yes , even those little wholesome blue balls of nutrition are n't safe .
