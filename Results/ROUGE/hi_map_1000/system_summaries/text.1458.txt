a five-year old screaming in iraq after her parents were killed by a vulture during a canadian territory inside the arctic circle . a video released this week of an extremely emaciated polar bear has served as a similar purpose : as a rallying cry and stand-in for a largely unmitigated environmental disaster . the video was shot by paul nicklen , a nature photographer and contributor to the national geographic magazine for the last 17 years . he is also a biologist by training and the co-founder of sea legacy , a nonprofit that uses storytelling and images to advocate for the environment . nicklen is no stranger to bears . from the time he was a child growing up in canada 's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild . " it â€™ s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me , but i know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy , " he said . " but it 's not like i walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat . "
