the israeli military says it has carried out a series of airstrikes across the gaza strip in response to renewed rocket fire . there was no immediate word on casualties from the strikes , the ap reports . the military accused palestinian militants of violating a cease-fire and said it maintains " both defense and striking capabilities in order to address the renewed aggression . " the airstrikes came minutes after palestinian militants fired three rockets into israel , breaking a temporary cease-fire and endangering negotiations in egypt over ending a monthling war between israel and hamas . authorities said the first three rockets landed in open fields near beersheba , causing no injuries . two were intercepted over netivot . later , longer-range rockets targeted tel aviv and jerusalem , and on monday the group ’ s walking away from the talks leaves hamas . " israel has the right to defend itself against such attacks , " state department spokeswoman marie harf told reporters . israeli officials say the first story in cairo to end the violence broke up with no deal , and killed 64 soldiers over a month of bloody battle . " my approach would be not to go for any agreement with hamas , because any agreement would give them something , and that ’ s a mistake , " dan meridor , a former israeli minister who served in several governments . " if the deal is seen by people as a victory for hamas , that 's bad for the future , and bad for deterrence. . "
