groupon was hit with its second lawsuit in as many months from employees who said they were screwed out of their overtime . this comes shortly after the online discounter lost its coo , its sales chief , its ipo date , and its favorite bullshit metric . it 's almost as though groupon is some sort of hive of misery and deceit ! the latest blow comes from a federal class action suit just filed in chicago , covering 50 " deal vetters , " employees responsible for reviewing groupon 's contract with merchants . the vetters in that suit recently amended their complaint to provide additional facts such as a sample work contract that reveals a starting salary of $ 32,000 . groupon did not return requests for comment . werman said about 50 deal vetters are affected by the new lawsuit , while over 1,000 salespeople are covered by an august class action also seeking overtime pay . this is what happens when your top people take out a ludicrous $ 810 million in bonuses before the ipo : everyone else in the operation starts looking real , real carefully at their own compensation . and , no , they wo n't give you a discount .
