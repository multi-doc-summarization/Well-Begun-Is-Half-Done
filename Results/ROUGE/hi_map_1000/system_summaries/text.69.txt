researchers found when they played recordings of people for elephants in kenya . scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals have n't shown . " basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with , " says a professor of animal behavior and cognition at the university of sussex in england . " they are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills . they 're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge . the only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain . " the study was released monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . some of the voices were from local maasai men , a group that herds cattle and sometimes comes into conflict with elephants over access to water and grazing space . occasionally , elephants are killed in clashes with maasai men . since women almost never spear elephants , the animals reacted less to the women 's voices . the recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages : " look over there . a group of elephants is coming , " keith lindsay , a conservation biologist and member of the scientific advisory committee of the amboseli elephant research project . " a lot of animals will take flight at just the general threat posed by people , but a smart animal doesn â€™ t do that . "
