north korea fired an unidentified projectile from its capital pyongyang that flew over japan , officials said , an especially aggressive test-flight that will rattle an already anxious region . seoul 's joint chiefs of staff on tuesday said the south korean and u.s. militaries were analyzing the launch and did n't immediately confirm how far the projectile traveled . japanese officials say the missile flew over the northern japanese island of hokkaido and landed in the pacific ocean . there was no damage to ships or anything else reported . japan 's nhk tv said the missile separated into three parts . the launch comes days after the north fired what was assessed as three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea and a month after its second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile , which are happening now , often staging weapons tests and releasing threats to seoul and washington in its state-controlled media . but animosity is higher than usual following threats by u.s. president donald trump to unleash " fire and fury " on the north , and pyongyang 's stated plan to consider firing some of its missiles toward guam . pyongyang regularly argues that the u.s.-south korean military exercises are an invasion rehearsal .
