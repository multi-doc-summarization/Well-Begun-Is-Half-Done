" i appreciate that being stuck in traffic is the last thing that people want to be doing , particularly on a weekend when the weather is hot , but on this occasion it was completely necessary to ensure officers saw this woman to safety. , " he said . " having members of the public taunt somebody who is clearly in a distressed state as we did earlier today is completely unacceptable . "
