lena dunham is proud of her body . the girls actress penned an empowering instagram post for not photoshopping her cellulite out of their february 2017 cover . " today this body is on the cover of a magazine that millions of women will read , without photoshop , my thigh on full imperfect display . whether you agree with my politics , like my show or connect to what i do , it does n't matter - my body is n't fair game . no one 's is , no matter their size , color , gender identity , and there 's a place for us all in popular culture to be recognized as beautiful , " she concluded . " no . this show would be different . girls is fiction , obviously . but it has been committed to portraying life , for the most part , as it is . the characters look like people , not actors who spend every waking second working out or tanning or shooting up human growth hormone . the apartments they inhabit are dim and cramped . their panic about work , money , and love is relatable , the sex they have is awkward , and they go to the bathroom , a lot . at times watching the characters flail around and shoot snot rockets in the bathtub can get uncomfortable , but then they reel you back in with a spot-on joke .
