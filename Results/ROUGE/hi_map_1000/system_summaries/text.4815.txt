if investors took a leap of faith when the bottom fell out of the market eight years ago and invested heavily in dow stocks , most would be sitting on a fairly sizeable nest egg today . the dow jones industrial average sank to its recent nadir of 6,547 , as hundreds of thousands of workers were losing jobs and the global financial system teetered on the edge of collapse . since then , it has more than tripled . if you â€™ d invested twenty thousand dollars in the dow of donald trump ? whether they are , the result has been manna for anyone who questioned its staying power . from a statistical perspective , this market 's no slouch . it has posted big enough returns to rank no . eight years along and no existential crisis plagues this advance , whose unbroken march from the depths of the great recession is the second longest ever . valuations are stretched and going by its age the rally is in rarefied air . but volatility , the ticker tape of investor anxiety , +0.08 % is a benchmark of 30 large u.s. companies and generally serves as a barometer of broader market conditions ; among investors here and abroad , the dow has skyrocketed more than 14,000 points to 20,855 .
