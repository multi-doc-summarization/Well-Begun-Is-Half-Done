bobby fuller died 32 years ago , on july 18 , 1966 , but to his friends and relatives , the death remains as painful and vivid as this morning 's obituary in hollywood . police concluded the death , due to inhalation of gasoline , was either a suicide or an accident . friends and family dispute that report , and the theories on the death are as varied as the individuals expressing them . " i just think he got in a bad situation that night , met the wrong dude and could n't get out of it . i 'm 99.9 percent sure that it was n't an accident or a suicide , " he said . " he was n't aware of that until it was too late . my theory is that they just wanted to work him over , but things went awry . so it was not the result of organized crime so much as disorganized crime . ... but nothing 's going to happen now , more than 30 years later . we 'll just never know what really happened . " police discovered blood and abrasions on the body , and skeptics point to that discovery as proof that the death was neither an accident nor a suicide .
