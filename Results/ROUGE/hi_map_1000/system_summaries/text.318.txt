george w. bush has a " interesting piece this week on what he calls the " brain dead politics , and a third wants a total withdrawal is a bit of a misnomer , reports the new york daily news . " we are likely to waste more lives than we save . i thought that was true before obama 's big speech , and i still think it now , afterward . at the moment he needed all of his persuasive powers , obama gave the worst major speech of his presidency . i have n't heard anyone argue for continued troop levels . the argument has either been to add troops of various numbers or get out as soon as possible . that said , the president delivered a thoughtful and sober speech outlining how we got into afghanistan and how , he thinks , we can get out . the question regarding obama and afghanistan was always whether he could be a wartime president . this is not the sort of presidency anything in his past prepared him for . it means finally owning a war that will claim the lives of many more americans -- and , given the history of these things , which i â€™ ll push back against gently here . first , thompson takes it as a given that where fertility rates fall , immigration will necessarily be a net economic benefit .
