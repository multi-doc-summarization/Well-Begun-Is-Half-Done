a pembroke pines police officer alleged that an arby â€™ s employee refused to serve her because she 's a cop . kenny davenport said he was working when pembroke pines sergeant jennifer martin pulled up to the drive thru , the bbc reports . the manager allegedly laughed about the condition of her food , decided not to eat there and asked for a refund , the report states . " it is beyond comprehension and deeply troubling that a business would deny service to a law enforcement officer instead of the one given to just the chief of the pines pines police department who got one today from the ceo of arby 's . we 're told that the chief was very appreciative and he accepted that apology , but when we at local10 reached out to arby , " he said . " i do n't find things like that very funny . i hope the rest of the nation does n't , either . terrell : he is wives of local law enforcement officers are talking about the monday night incident involving pines police sergeant jennifer from kendall , i 'm john turchin , local10 news coverages . calvin : calvin , that manager opening up to us off camera just about as her was about to head into work on pines boulevard near flamingo road . he says it was a baddie attempt at humor . he may still have his job tonight but the controversy is certainly growing around what happened .
