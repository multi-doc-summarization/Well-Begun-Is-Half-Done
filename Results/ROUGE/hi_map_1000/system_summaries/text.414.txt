indian parents are suing the minnesota department of human services , the minnesota attorney general and a commissioner with the mille lacs band of ojibwe to allow the baby to a white couple , they would exercise their legal right to intervene and try to place the baby with indian parents . " i do n't believe icwa hurts children . i believe the application by certain tribes does cause harm , " she said , per the new york times . " in an adoption , all of that information is private and confidential . if you 're trying to remove a child over 6 months , if the placement is not causing them harm and willing to make it permanent . i will always object to a removal , tribal or not , if you ’ re indian , that has to be surrendered to the tribe. . " the couple are putting their own interests above the rights of the child , who would be better served with an indian family . the lawsuit challenges federal and state laws enacted in the 1970s and 1980s that sought to keep indian children in indian families . the laws were an attempt to remedy the tradition of breaking up indian families by sending their children into institutions or to non-indian adoptive parents . the couple want the court to throw out the state 's requirement to inform a tribe of an adoption . " it 's been my experience in these cases that most of the birthparents identify problems with family , alcoholism and other dysfunction , and they don ’ t want kids placed in that kind of environment. , " he says .
