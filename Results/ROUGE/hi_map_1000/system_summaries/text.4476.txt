britain sent a royal air force plane to crisis-hit cyprus on tuesday carrying one million euros in cyprus stopped giving out money as the island deals with the fallout from a controversial eurozone bailout deal , a spokesman said . " an raf flight left for cyprus this afternoon with one million euro on board as a contingency measure to provide military personnel and their families with emergency loans , " the spokesman says . " the chancellor set out the position that both he and the foreign secretary made clear at the weekend , which is that all uk personnel will be compensated in full for any losses as a result of the decisions that may be taken with regard to the cyprus banking situation , " he adds . " they have actually now said to people 'we will come after your deposits , no matter how small your savings are ' and that seems to me to make it more likely that , if you are a saver in spain or in italy , for example , and you have just the sniff of the eu or the imf coming situation on our people .
