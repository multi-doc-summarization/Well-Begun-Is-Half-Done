spacex sent a classified u.s. spy agency mission on its way to orbit monday morning , then brought the rocket ’ s first stage home for a landing , possibly to fly again . the flight appeared to be off to a good start , but spacex cut off its launch broadcast a few minutes into the flight to help preserve its secrecy . " launch and landing of the nro spy satellite was good . tough call , as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6 % of the theoretical load limit , " musk posted on twitter just after liftoff . " if the wind shear were outside the range of pre-calculated , safe limits … the rocket wouldn ’ t be able to stay on trajectory . or worse , could potentially over stress the rocket , causing catastrophic failure. . " musk 's launch represented the first time spacex has delivered a satellite into space for nro . the company has been primarily focused on launching commercial satellites into space , along with cargo missions to the international space station . spacex has said that reusability is a key component of potentially sending a manned mission to mars .
