a new shopping centre has been found in europe dating back to the roman period , reports the bbc . " the partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle , " says archaeozoologist alfred galik from the institute for anatomy , histology and embryology at the university of veterinary medicine vienna . " but one look at the cervical vertebrae , the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel . " " this means that the animal was not killed and then butchered . it may have been acquired as part of an exchange , " he says . " they probably did n't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it . perhaps it died a natural death and was then buried without being used . " camel bones or partly preserved skeletons are known from mauerbach near vienna as well as from serbia and belgium . but a complete camel skeleton is unique for central europe . the skeleton was found in a typical post-mortal posture with its neck bent backwards and drawn-up extremities . the camel was male , around seven years old and most likely castrated . find dated to the 17th century besides animal bones , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
