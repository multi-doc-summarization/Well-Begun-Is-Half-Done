ted frank is " ted frank and i love the chicken sandwiches at chick-fil-a . but i also like my gay-married friends and do n't like the guilt of indirectly supporting chick-fil-a 's stance on gay rights . and i know there are lots of other people in the same boat . so i 've started chickenoffset.com . every time you buy a chicken-sandwich meal at chick-fil-a , you can buy an " offset " here . you can print out the receipt and demonstrate to your friends that the money you gave for lgbt youth more than compensates for the profits you put in chick-fil-a 's coffers . we promise to send a minimum of 80 % of the proceeds after expenses to it gets better and the williams institute . " " i posted on facebook that donating money to gay rights causes did a heck of a lot more good than depriving christian groups of $ 0.0001 by boycotting chick-fil-a , " frank tells the huffington post . " a friend joked 'chicken offsets ' in response , the domain name was open , and someone else would 've come up with the idea if i did n't execute . "
