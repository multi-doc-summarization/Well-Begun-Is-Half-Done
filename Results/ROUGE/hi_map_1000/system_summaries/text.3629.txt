the silicon valley company , bloom energy , did n't offer many new details wednesday about how it plans to make its promising fuel-cell technology affordable enough for regular people to buy for their homes . that 's an important question because the company 's product _ is not revolutionary , nor is it the cheapest or most efficient fuel cell system available . " it really is nothing new . go to any [ solid oxide fuel cell ] web site and you 'll see the same stuff , " says mike brown , a ceramic engineer and fuel cell expert at the colorado school of mines . " i think we had anticipated just about everything that 's on their web site , " brown said . " but it 's nice to at least finally see something " after ten years , which is about how long the bloom box has been in development . all people do n't realize that energy is converted from one form or another to make electricity . at the end of the day , solar energy drives almost everything we do . coal and petroleum are created by the decomposition of organisms that lived millions of years ago , and themselves used the sun 's energy to grow . the fuel cell was developed at the space agency as part of its plan for planetary exploration . it potentially is as important as any other nasa discovery and directly benefits people here on planet earth , making it a pretty good investment of tax dollars .
