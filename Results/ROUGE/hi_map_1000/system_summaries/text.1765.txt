bill watterson for team cul de sac ( for richard thompson ) , and the first new art from him that his syndicate has seen in the 16 subsequent years , say executives with universal uclick and its parent company , andrews mcmeel . the artwork is of the character petey otterloop from richard thompson 's comic strip kellett and filmmaker frederick schroeder , reports the washington post . " the strip depicts all sorts of moments that ring true with regard to childhood , " he said . " it sounded like fun , and maybe something people wouldn â€™ t expect , so i decided to give it a try . dave sent me a rough cut of the film and i dusted the cobwebs off my ink . " watterson , who is a finalist for the national cartoonist society 's reuben award in may , says he 's " not involved with the film , so dave 's request to draw the poster came completely out of the blue , " watterson says . " i just realized that , rather than a generic cartoonist this could be calvin himself , 20 years later . the blonde hair , the haircut , those eyes , the green socks ... hmmmm . sploid is a new blog about awesome stuff .
