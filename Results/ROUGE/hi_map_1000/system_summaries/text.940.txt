" it broke off completely about one metre off the ground , " a spokesman for the house said . " someone yelled , 'it 's falling . the tree is falling , ' and then you heard it go down , " said museum spokeswoman maatje . " luckily no one was hurt . " a global campaign to save the chestnut , widely known as the anne frank tree , was launched in 2007 after city officials deemed it a safety hazard and ordered it felled . the netherlands was granted a last-minute reprieve after a battle in court . the 150-year-old tree suffered from fungus and was set to be felled in 2007 due to concerns for the safety of the 1 million people who visit anne frank â€™ s house each year . but officials and conservationists later agreed to secure it with a steel frame to prolong its life and saplings from the tree were planted by wind and heavy rain on the trunk . the jewish teenager made several references to the tree in the diary that she kept during the 25 months she remained indoors until her family was arrested in august 1944 .
