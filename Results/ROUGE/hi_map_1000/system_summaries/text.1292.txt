" i 've not seen that in my life , " he said . " there is no safety-net for the injured ncaa athlete . " ware 's late-night release said no timetable for recovery has been set , but the injury is not likely a career-ending one . " it 's an injury that needs to be dealt with in a swift fashion due to the fact that it was open , and there are infection concerns , and then obviously you , in many ways , it had been an exemplary few days for the ncaa and its signature basketball tournamentâ€”a weekend that put the madness so special .
