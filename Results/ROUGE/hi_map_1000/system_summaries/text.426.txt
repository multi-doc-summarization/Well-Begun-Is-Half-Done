edward snowden 's attempts to seek refuge outside the united states hit hurdles tuesday , after russian media reported he canceled his asylum bid in russia and several european countries , the ap reports . " are we responsible for getting him to ecuador ? it 's not logical , but in this moment he is in russian territory and these are decisions for the russian authorities , " he said . " we have given asylums in the past but we are not an open house for asylums since we have a careful and objective policy . " the president , speaking at the presidential palace in quito , said his government did not intentionally help snowden travel from hong kong to moscow with a temporary travel pass . the ecuadorean consul in london acted without authority from quito , including india and china . snowden has been on the run since he exposed highly secret national security agency surveillance programs . he is believed to be staying in the transit area , but he said he had no plans to turn over snowden to the us states . snowden was russia 's responsibility and would have to reach ecuadorean territory before the country would consider any asylum request , the president said in an interview with the guardian on monday . he said india carefully examined the application to moscow as the kremlin had set conditions . he accuses us president barack obama of putting pressure on the countries to which he has applied . " mr if you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so , you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called tails . "
