a new species of a strange bird to a remote island in the pacific ocean has been discovered in the process of a novel way in which new species arise with a member of another species resident on the island , reports the bbc . researchers say they were able to watch the speciation in progress , the ap reports . " we did n't see him fly in from over the sea , but we noticed him shortly after he arrived . he was so different from the other birds that we knew he did , " he said , per the journal science . " the novelty of this study is that we can follow the emergence of new species in the wild , in real-time . and it took just two generations . now , genomic sequencing and the analysis of physical characteristics have confirmed the new species occurred during field work carried out over the last four decades by b. rosemary and peter grant , two scientists from princeton , a graduate student working with the grants on daphne 's finch , endemic , and a senior biologist in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology .
