joel davis was arrested tuesday in manhattan on charges of child pornography and attempting to sexually exploit children as young as two years old . davis spent years as a sexual assault prevention activist both on and off columbia ’ s campus , helping to found youth to end sexual violence and serving as the chairman of the international campaign to stop rape and gender violence . after being arrested , davis allegedly confessed to officers that he had sexually abused a thirteen-year-old boy in the past , and that he kept child pornography on his phone . davis was a columnist for spectator in 2017 , writing on topics including being a survivor of sexual assault ( like most spectator columnists , davis was an outside contributor who was not a member of spectator ’ s staff ) . " it 's difficult to me to kind of grapple with that , that on one hand , this is supposed to be our success point , but nothing has really changed . at least not enough for me , " he said . " i spent my own gap year working at the united nations , and for the former obama administration . when news broke that i was being considered for a nobel prize , i had a psychological breakdown—tormented by the recollection of my childhood sex abuse—and withdrew from columbia . it was another year before i attended my first class . without having established any roots , i returned to columbia unnerved . those of us who have experienced such trials usually have gravitated toward people like us for support , validation , and collective identity .
