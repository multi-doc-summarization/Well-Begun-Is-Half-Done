a group of scientists say it has now reconstructed the history of the planet 's sea levels arcing back over some 3,000 years to conclude that the rate of increase experienced in the 20th century was " extremely likely " to have been faster than during nearly the entire period . " we can say with 95 percent probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries , " says bob kopp , a climate scientist at rutgers university who led the research with nine colleagues from several u.s. and global universities . kopp said it 's not that seas rose faster before that – they probably didn ’ t – but merely that the ability to say as much with the same level of confidence declines . the study was published in the peer-reviewed proceedings of the national academy of sciences . seas rose about 14 centimeters ( 5.5 inches ) from 1900 to 2000 , the new study suggests , for a rate of 1.4 millimeters per year . the current rate , according to nasa , " temperature-driven global sea-level variability in the context of the last three millennia , " per the ap .
