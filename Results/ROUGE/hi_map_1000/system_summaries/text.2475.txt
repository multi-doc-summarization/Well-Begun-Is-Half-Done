a facebook user named nolan daniels posted a poorly-photoshopped picture of his supposedly-winning powerball ticket , along with the offer that he would give $ 1 million to a random person who shared it . so far it 's been shared over 200,000 times , because like-addled facebook users will share anything no matter how obviously untrue it is . when one of daniel 's friends asked if he was serious he replied " 239 million ! i 'm out celebrating now , " reports the bbc . " the tickets print the white ball numbers ( the first five numbers ) in numerical order , " he said . " we 've reached out to daniels to see why he is n't volunteering for charity or learning a second language since he apparently has too much time on his hands . since the drawing , a couple in missouri has been identified as the holders of one of two winning tickets . but you do n't even have to examine the pixels to tell this is a fake . while the numbers on daniels ' ticket do match those that won half of the record $ 587.5 million jackpot .
