republicans pushed a nearly $ 1.5 trillion tax bill through the senate early saturday after a burst of eleventh-hour horse trading , as a party starved all year for a major legislative triumph took a giant step toward giving president donald trump one of his top priorities by christmas . " big bills are rarely popular . you remember how unpopular 'obamacare ' was when it passed ? " senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , r-ky. , said in an interview , shrugging off polls showing scant public enthusiasm for the measure . he said the legislation would prove to be " just what the country needs to get growing again . " trump hailed the bill 's passage on twitter , thanking mcconnell and senate finance chairman orrin hatch in a tweet after the bill passed , adding , “ we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america. ” mcconnell and gop leaders were able to score the necessary votes on friday by acceding to demands by sens . susan collins of maine , ron johnson of wisconsin and others for expanded tax breaks for small businesses , homeowners and others . that gave leadership the breathing room to push through an obamacare repeal measure this year .
