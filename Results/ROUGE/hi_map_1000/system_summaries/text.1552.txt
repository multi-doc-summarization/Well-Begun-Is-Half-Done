donald trump 's campaign poses a challenge to us all . the huffington post reports that trump has distinguished himself as fastest to dive to the bottom . if it ’ s a lie too vile to utter aloud , count on mr. trump to say it , often . narcissistic bullies who rise to prominence by spreading lies , appealing to fears and stoking hatred . such people are dangerous . like many americans , our first inclination was to ignore mr. trump . he was a buffoon , a disseminator of ludicrous rumors about president obama 's birthplace . he tweeted a false statistic that thousands of american muslims openly celebrated the 2001 attacks on the world trade center ; in fact , there were no such celebrations . he spreads the lie that blacks are responsible for 81 percent of murders of white victims , and his candidacy has tugged the debate toward divisiveness as his bigotry has drawn cheers and many of his rivals have strove to mimic him . " when the syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country , we don ’ t know if they ’ re coming from , " he writes . " and i definitely want a database and other checks and balances . we want to go with databases . and we have no choice . we have seen the likes of him before , in the united states and elsewhere : i ’ m looking the other day . it 's probably not , but it could be the great trojan horse of all time , where they come in. .
