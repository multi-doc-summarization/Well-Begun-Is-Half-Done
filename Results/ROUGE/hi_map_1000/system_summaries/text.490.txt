british scientists found traces of wheat dna in a stone age site off the south coast of england near the isle of wight , giving an unexpected sign of contact between ancient hunter-gatherers and farmers who eventually replaced them . the wheat dna was dated to 8,000 years ago , 2,000 years before farming reached what is now northern germany or france , they wrote in the journal science . " this is a smoking gun of cultural interaction , " he said . " we can only speculate how they got wheat -- it could have been trade , a gift or stolen . " he also found dna of oak , poplar and beech and of dogs or wolves , deer , grouse and auroch , a type of cow . there was no trace of wheat pollen in the samples , indicating that it was not grown locally . the scientists found the dna at what was apparently a pre-historic site for boat building . when the dna was deposited , the english channel was yet to be formed and britain was part of mainland europe . agriculture was unknown in britain until about 6,000 years ago so the discovery suggests trade between english hunter gatherers and neolithic farmers must have existed for thousands of years previously .
