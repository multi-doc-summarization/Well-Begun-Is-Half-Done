donald trump has announced that he will nominate attorney david friedman to israel , selecting an envoy who supports israeli settlements and other changes to u.s. policies in the region . friedman said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from " the u.s. embassy in israel 's eternal capital , jerusalem , " even though the embassy is in tel aviv . like some of his predecessors , trump has vowed to move the american embassy to jerusalem , a politically charged act that would anger palestinians who want east jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory . the move would also distance the u.s. from most of the international community , including its closest allies in western europe and the arab world . the statement does n't detail how friedman could work in jerusalem . however , trump advisers have insisted in recent days that the president-elect will follow through on his call for moving the embassy . " he has made that promise , " trump adviser kellyanne conway told reporters thursday . " i can guarantee you , just generally , he 's a man who is going to accomplish many things very quickly . "
