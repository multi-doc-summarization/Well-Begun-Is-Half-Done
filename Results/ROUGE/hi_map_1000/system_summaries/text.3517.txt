fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over . but evolution is a strange game in which seemingly every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off , and for the fish of antarctica that trade-off is quite the paradox . for the benefit of avoiding frozen blood , antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins . the notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the antarctic region . even after being studied for decades , the notothenioid , a bony fish that thrives after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens . " we 've known for a long time that the antifreeze proteins are at the essence of how these fishes survive in their freezing environment . but we 're still working out the details , and this is one of those details , " paul cziko , a doctoral student the university of oregon 's institute of ecology and evolution , said in a press release . " since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes ' spleens , we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation . "
