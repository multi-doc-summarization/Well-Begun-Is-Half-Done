the iranian government gave me a very rare journalist visa , along with permission to drive unescorted across the country on a government-approved route from mashhad in the east to tabriz in the west , and back to tehran . i interviewed people at random along the way , and as far as i could tell i was not tailed . compared with my last visit , in 2004 , people seem more than us presents or inviting us into their homes . and in the security line to board a flight from tehran to mashhad , a revolutionary guard said genially , " we ’ re not supposed to let batteries through , but we ’ ll make an exception for you since you ’ re a foreigner. . " the government 's " most pro-american road trip across iran began with a giddy paean to america , reinforcing my view that at the grass-roots level , this may be the most pro-american nation in the middle east , " he writes . " we love america ! " he added , " i can ’ t blame america . i love america too much. . "
