a new study suggests that scientists from the university of siena in italy found that using a light box , similar to those used to treat some forms of depression , increased testosterone levels . and this led to greater reported levels of sexual satisfaction . but they said more research was needed before it could be used as a treatment . the researchers carried out their study on 38 men who had been diagnosed with disorders which cause a lack of interest in sex . bright light one half of the group was treated with an adapted light box which gave out significantly less light . they were treated for half an hour early in the morning for two weeks . when they found that the group exposed to the bright light tripled their sexual satisfaction scores while the control group 's scores stayed roughly the same , the ap reports . " in the northern hemisphere , the body 's testosterone production naturally declines from november through until april and then rises steadily through the spring and summer with a peak in october , " says the study . " you see the effect of this in reproductive rates , with the month of june showing the highest rate of conception . the use of the light box really mimics what nature does . "
