india 's top court has ruled that adultery is no longer a crime , striking down a 158-year-old colonial-era law which it said treated women as male property . previously any man who had sex with a married woman , without the permission of her husband , had committed a crime . a petitioner had challenged the law saying it was arbitrary and discriminated against men and women . it is not clear how many men have been prosecuted under the law , but it was often raised in divorce proceedings , lawyers say . the case , brought by an indian businessman living in italy , sought to have section 497 of the indian penal code and another similar provision made gender neutral . " it is time to say husband is not the master , " says the chief justice , dipak misra . " they are not in any way situated differently than men , " a government counsel tells the court . " the british had done away with it long back , we were still stuck with it. . " india 's national commission for women , however , says the woman could not be punished as an abettor . " i wouldn â€™ t yet call it a progressive era in the court , " he said .
