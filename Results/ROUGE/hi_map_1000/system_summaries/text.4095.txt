a small-town pizza shop is saying they agree with governor pence and the signing of the controversial religious freedom restoration act . the o'connor , who owns memories pizza , says they have a right to believe in their religion and protect those ideals . " if a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding , we would have to say no , " says kevin o'connor . " i could n't figure out why so many bad reviews from california and 1st time posters until learning that this place has been under attack from the gay community . i brought those fake reviews to the attention of yelp and they refuse to clean this awful awful pizza sauce tasted like red dry ketchup from expired bottles having sat for years in a broom closet that is never cleaned . just disgusting . not upset it closed kinda happy actually i estimate the food , service and d√©cor of memories is still in the constitution , i 'm glad believers stepped up and helped just the worst pizza you can imagine ca n't even imagine why people would n't serve there food for a gay wedding . it would n't surprise me if the gay wedding situation was engineered by social justice warriors to cause trouble for this business .
