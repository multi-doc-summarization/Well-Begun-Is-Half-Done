a weakened prime minister benjamin netanyahu emerged wednesday from israel 's national election likely to serve a third term , after voters on tuesday gave a surprising second place to a new centrist party founded by a television celebrity who emphasized kitchen-table issues like class size and apartment prices . for mr. netanyahu , who entered the race an overwhelming favorite with no obvious challenger , the outcome was a humbling rebuke as his ticket lost seats in the new parliament . over all , his conservative team came in first , but it was the center , led by the political novice yair lapid , 49 , that emerged newly invigorated , suggesting that at the very least israel ’ s rightward tilt may be stalled . " the likud government is in danger , go vote for us for the sake of the country ’ s future. , " he said . " we have n't had a single free moment since this morning . " netanyahu posted a panicky message on facebook before the polls closed , saying , " i worked during the previous elections as well and i can ’ t recall such a flow of voters , certainly not at this hour .
