egypt 's banned muslim brotherhood will apply to become a political party , it announced tuesday . the brotherhood " envisions the establishment of a democratic , civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice , with central islamic values serving all egyptians regardless of colour , creed , political trend or religion , " it said in the statement . " they are a powerful force at present , but my fear is that islamist groups outside egypt , seeing the opportunity in the current chaos , will flood them with support if they back an extremist view , " cnn national security contributor frances fragos townsend , who was president george w. bush 's counterterrorism advisor . " and it 's important for us not to say that our only two options are either the muslim brotherhood or a suppressed egyptian people , " the president said . " but they do tend to eschew violence and muslim peoples to stand behind it and support it ... we say to our brothers the mujahideen in gaza : be patient , persist in [ your jihad ] , and know that allah is with you .
