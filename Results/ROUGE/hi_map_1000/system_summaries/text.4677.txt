researchers have made a significant advance toward replacing large pieces of bone in humans by growing a pig 's own cells into bone in the lab and then using it to restore a piece of missing jaw , reports the new york daily news . " the pigs woke up , and a half-hour later they were eating , " says a professor of biomedical engineering at columbia university . " we thought they would be in pain . but no , they ’ re doing great. ” dr. vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues have managed to create living bone from stem cells . first , they made a ct scan to create a 3-d image of each pig 's jaw , created from a computed tomography scan . from cow bone , who was not involved in the study , " being able to translate the outside , but they would n't penetrate to the center . so the team designed a silicon new bone injury that can be grafted onto existing bone to encourage the body ’ s natural process of degrading bone . " " you ’ re worth trying in humans , " he writes . " it would give growth in the scaffold a kind of head start , so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it , and that it is not junk mail . we do not capture any email address .
