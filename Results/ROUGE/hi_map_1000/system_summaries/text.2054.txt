a new york city polling places opened late because ballots and poll books were expected to be at their poll sites at 5 a.m. election day morning to set up . this gives them one hour before poll sites open . but elsewhere , it 's an entire national newsroom , essentially only looking at problems facing people who vote . " i was an election administrator for over a decade in arizona and the majority of our sites were set up before election day , " says a propublica senior reporting . " it ’ s fairly common to keep the voting material under lock and key before election , and they ’ re getting on-site help from professional reporters dispatched by propublica , the usa today and the new york times to package up relevant information for sharing electionland , it was a no-brainer for many local outlets crushed in recent years by layoffs and budget cuts . after all , what they ’ ’ t it be a much worse scenario if you walked into an election site and you had the whole poll site set up to election through some of this stuff , to get to the more useful stuff , is absolutely valuable .
