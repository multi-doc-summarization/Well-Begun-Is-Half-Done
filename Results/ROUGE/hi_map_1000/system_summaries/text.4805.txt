interior secretary ryan zinke is recommending that six of 27 national monuments under review by the trump administration be reduced in size , with changes to several others proposed . a leaked memo from zinke to president donald trump recommends that two utah monuments - be reduced , along with nevada 's gold butte and oregon 's cascade-siskiyou . two marine monuments in the pacific ocean also would be reduced under zinke 's memo , which has not been officially released . the associated press obtained a copy of the bears ears and grand staircase-escalante preserves in utah and bears ears , which is on sacred tribal land . no other president has tried to eliminate a monument , but some have trimmed and redrawn boundaries 18 times , according to a report sent to the white house and reviewed by the wall street journal . " this callous proposal will needlessly punish local , predominantly rural communities that depend on parks and public lands for outdoor recreation , sustainable jobs and economic growth , " williams said . " if president trump acts in support of these recommendations , the wilderness society will move swiftly to challenge those actions in court . "
