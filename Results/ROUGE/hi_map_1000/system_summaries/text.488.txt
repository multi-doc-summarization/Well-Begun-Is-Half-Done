china has suspended imports of shellfish from the west coast of the united states , but china 's government says it will continue indefinitely . " they ’ ve never done anything like that , where they would not allow shellfish from this entire area based on potentially two areas or maybe just one area . we don ’ t really know yet , " borchert said , per the washington post . the ban is a particularly nettlesome problem in washington because china accounts for about 90 percent of geoduck exports from the state . and fisheries in the state harvest and farm 5.5 million to 7 million pounds of geoduck annually , or psp , in a nov. 21 shipment of geoducks . psp is a biotoxin produced by algae that shellfish and all other two-shelled bivalves harvested from the holiday season leading up to the chinese celebration of the lunar new year . " it ’ s had an incredible impact , " says george hill , the geoduck harvest coordinator for puget sound 's suquamish tribe . " a couple thousand divers out of work right now. , " he said . " we ’ re waiting to hear back from chinese officials for more details that will help them identify the exact source . "
