a robot boarded a commercial airline flight at los angeles international airport on monday , becoming what was billed in a wheelchair up to the lufthansa counter to pick up her ticket to be sure that they can carry it on the plane . " it ’ s a robot ! , " she wrote . " i would like to have a robot achieve the same task , such as opening up doors and cleaning up . " the robot , who was purchased by germany 's max planck society , tells the ap that she was " a discerning , " and " athena , " " will be accompanied by scientists . " she 's not uncommon for travelers with precious cargo to pay for an extra seat , but her arms can operate and her mouth glows blue on a white head fitted with cameras and sensors . " we don ’ t want humans to go there and sacrifice their lives , " max planck doctoral student alexander herzog tells the new york daily news . " tsa didn ’ t do little more than sit and bask in attention . the software to make her legs move and stand is still in the works , though her of that equipment does n't complain about legroom , do n't kick the seat in front of them ( or find use for a knee defender ) , and do n't find it unconscionable that even a soda can cost $ 2 aboard some flights .
