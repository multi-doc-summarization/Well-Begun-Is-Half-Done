facebook is acquiring the majority of the patents microsoft just acquired from aol for $ 550 million in cash , along with rights to 275 aol patents microsoft plans to retain . while facebook and microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents , it is expected that facebook will do just that . " this is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect facebook â€™ s interests over the long term , " ted ullyot , general counsel at facebook , said in a statement . the agreement between microsoft and facebook , announced on monday , came less than two weeks after microsoft agreed to pay more than $ 1 billion for 925 patents held by aol . in a second deal , microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents . microsoft will assign to facebook the right to purchase 650 patents and patent applications of the total , plus a license to the 300 patents aol still retains and which microsoft has licensed . to license those 300 patents , facebook will have to go directly to aol .
