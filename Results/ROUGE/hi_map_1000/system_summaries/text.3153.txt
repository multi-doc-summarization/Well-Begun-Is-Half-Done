a new study led by a researcher at the university of california , davis , slays that troll in the realm of fantasy video games , the gaming community remains , in some ways , hostile toward women . for example , the cyber harassment of female gamers and game designers that erupted in 2014 and involved a harassment campaign against prominent female gamers , journalists and designers , reflected a longstanding undercurrent of misogyny and sexism in the community . " once you take into account all these confounding factors , the gender differences disappear , " says the study . " the prevalent stereotype is that women are not as good of players as men. . " scientists say that women can sit on a couch and contort their fingers while screaming at a television screen better than women . " even though more and more women have become gamers , and more are involved in designing games , gaming communities as a whole are still very hostile , " he says . " there is no gender difference . " ( the study notes that women who aren are n't better gamers than women , they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time . )
