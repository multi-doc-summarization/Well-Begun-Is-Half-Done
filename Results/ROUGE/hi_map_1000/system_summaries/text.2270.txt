jason alexander revealed why the showrunners killed off his fiancee in " seinfeld , " adding that it was hard to " play off " actress heidi swedberg , he took to twitter today to apologize . " ok folks , i feel officially awful . yesterday on @ sternshow , i retold a story i had told years ago about my personal difficulties and insecurities in playing george against the susan that heidi swedberg created . the impetus for telling this story was that howard said , 'julia louis dreyfuss told me you all wanted to kill her ' so i told the story to try and clarify would have taken her query and possibly tried to adjust the scenes with her . she surely offered . but , i did n't have that maturity or security . and , larry and jerry would probably have killed me as it was all playing exactly as they wanted . clearly susan and george were coming off just the way they wanted , " he writes . " i actually launched into this on stern to defend you . but this is why i 'm not a lawyer . now everybody , calm down and just enjoy the reruns and think , 'why did he think this was n't working ? this is great . "
