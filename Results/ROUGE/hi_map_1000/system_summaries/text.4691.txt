a new genetic blood test might pave the way for detecting early stage cancers that often prove fatal when caught too late , a new study suggests . the test scans blood for dna fragments released by cancerous tumors , explained lead researcher dr. victor velculescu , professor of oncology at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center , whose study was published in the journal science translational medicine . in making the test , the challenge was to identify rare dna from real cancers while ignoring other types of genetic alterations that can occur as blood cells divide or genetic alterations . " if we are able to detect cancer earlier , our chances of saving lives would be much higher , " velculescu says . " the survival difference between late-stage and early stage disease in these cancers accounts for over a million lives worldwide each year . " researchers behind the early-stage test hope it could be used to identify cancers at a stage when patients have a better chance at survival . " to our knowledge , this is one of the first studies that has looked directly at early-stage cancers , " he said . " it is not a test that 's going to be available in a clinical laboratory anytime soon . "
