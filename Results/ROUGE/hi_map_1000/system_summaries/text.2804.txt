a new study from ut shows that some snakes have been observed to increase their chances of success . vladimir dinets , a research assistant professor at the university of tennessee , was guiding a bird- and mammal-watching tour through desembarco del granma national park , cuba , when he first noticed the cavern-hunting snakes . intrigued by the bold behavior , he decided to take a closer look . the boas involved could all be found basking near the cave ’ s entrance during the day , while the bats slumbered in an adjacent chamber separated by a narrow passage . " i suspect that if their numbers in a cave fall , they can ’ t hunt in groups anymore and might die out even if some of them don ’ t get caught by hunters , " dinets says . " they just take each other ’ s positions into account. . " the snakes coordinated with one another , it 's not quite accurate to say they hunted together . " it is possible that coordinated hunting is not uncommon among snakes , but it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out , " he says .
