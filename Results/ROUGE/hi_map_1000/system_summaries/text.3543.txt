supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg was on display in her chambers late monday , when she declined to retreat from her earlier criticism of donald trump and even elaborated on it . " he is a faker , " she tells the new york times . " i took a detour to raise the reverberations from her criticism of trump to the code of conduct for u.s . judges and the judicial conduct and disability rules , or read the public comments and witness statements , and however in keeping with her known political bent , they were known as the " code of judicial conduct for united states judges . " the ap notes that ginsburg 's comments came in a previously scheduled interview related to my research for a book on chief justice john roberts . trump responded wednesday morning by calling on ginsburg to resign . " justice ginsburg of the u.s. supreme court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me , " he said . " how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns ? the press seems to be very gentle with him on that . "
