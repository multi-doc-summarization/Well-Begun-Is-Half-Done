the voting rights act of 1965 may be in peril , judging from tough questioning on wednesday from the supreme court 's more conservative members . if the court overturns the provision , nine states , mostly in the south , would become free to change voting procedures without first getting permission from federal officials . in a vivid argument in which the lawyers and justices drew varying lessons from the legacies of slavery , the civil rights movement , the court ’ s conservative wing suggested that the modern south had outgrown its troubled past and that the legal burdens on the nine states were no longer justified . chief justice john g. roberts jr. asked skeptically whether " the citizens in the voting more racist than citizens in 2006 , " he said . " do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement ? " he added , " it 's gotten a lot better . but it ’ s still there. . " the law was challenged by shelby county , ala. w. rein , who said that the nation lived through 200 years of slavery and 80 years of racial segregation . " this statute is in part about our march through history to keep promises that our constitution says for too long were unmet , " she says . " of course it was aimed at treating some states differently than others. . "
