the pentagon has made contingency plans to send small teams of special operations troops into syria if the white house decides it needs to secure chemical weapons depots now controlled by security forces loyal to president bashar assad , senior u.s. officials said . the army has this week used tanks and helicopter gunships in an offensive around damascus that are left unguarded and at risk falling into the hands of rebel fighters or militias aligned with al qaeda , hezbollah or other militant groups . securing the sites would probably involve stealthy raids by special operations teams trained to handle such weapons , and precision airstrikes to incinerate the chemicals without dispersing them in the air , the officials say . the united nations said some of the weapons being used by government forces appeared to have been supplied by iran , in violation of a u.n. newspaper who was sympathetic to the anti-assad revolt . activists said he had been executed in nahr eisha . " there are 22 tanks in kfar souseh now and behind each one there are at least 30 soldiers . they are raiding houses and executing men , " said leonard spector , who heads the james martin center for nonproliferation studies at the monterey institute of international studies . " the actual killing may be less important than the panic they would induce . "
