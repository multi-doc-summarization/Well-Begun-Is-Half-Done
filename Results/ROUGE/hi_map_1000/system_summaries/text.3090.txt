" i was in love with farzana and killed my first wife because of this love . " he added that parveen 's family killed another one of their daughters some years ago . " most 'honor ' crimes can be traced to inflexible and discriminatory attitudes about women 's roles , especially around sexuality , " says a police spokesman . " women or couples seen as having brought 'dishonor ' on the community face violence , which is then held out as a chilling example for others . "
