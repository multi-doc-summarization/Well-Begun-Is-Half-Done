greece 's parliament looked increasingly likely to approve unpopular austerity measures on wednesday , reports the new york times . " it would also allow for work to proceed rapidly on a second package of financial assistance , enabling the country to move forward and restoring hope to the greek people. , " says a former chief economist . " but there ’ s every sign that europe won ’ t do that , so the likelihood of a problem down the line is very significant. ” " it 's a giant step in terms of conception , " he said . " greece is basically being bribed not to default . but as long as greece doesn ’ t grow briskly for a sustained period , it ’ s in hot water. . " the european council president , herman van rompuy , tells reuters that greece had taken " a vital step back — from the very grave scenario of default. ” " but we ’ re the decision to vote for the plan because national interests are more important than our own dignity , " the deputy , thomas robopoulos , says the president of the hellenic foundation for european and foreign policy , in athens . " if europe comes together with an appropriate framework , that will enable a default to be avoided . "
