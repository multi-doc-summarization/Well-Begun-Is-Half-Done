a florida state lawmaker wants to use firing squads or the electric chair for those on death row , the ap reports . rep. brad drake filed a bill this week that would end the use of lethal injection in florida executions , reports the ap . drake 's lawyers tried to stop the execution by arguing that a new lethal drug cocktail would cause him pain and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment . courts , however , rejected that argument and let the execution go forward . but drake said that those who caused suffering and grief for families should get their day of reckoning . " i just do n't think they should be able to get off that easy , " he said . " let 's put our pants back on the right way . " florida first began using the bill during the 2012 session that starts in january . he said government is spending too much time listening to advocacy groups and instead should put in place a death sentence that forces convicted murderers to contemplate their fates . lethal injection just allows a person to die in their sleep while a firing squad or electrocution would force death row inmates to think about their punishment " every morning , " drake says . " given all that former members of the florida supreme court and the american bar association have said about florida 's broken death penalty system , including the nation 's highest number of exonerations , this would be embarrassing _ if our legislature were capable of embarrassment .
