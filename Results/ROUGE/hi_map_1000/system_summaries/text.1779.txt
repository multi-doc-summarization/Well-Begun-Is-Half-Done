swiss scientists broke a four-decade-long informal ban on lsd research yesterday when they announced the results of a study in which cancer patients received the drug to curb their anxiety about death . the study , which was published in the journal of nervous and mental disease , looked at the safety and efficacy of lsd when used in combination with talk therapy . the patients underwent 30 such trips over the course of two months . a year after the sessions ceased , the patients who took lsd , most of whom were terminally ill , experienced 10-hour-long supervised " trips . " one patient described the trips to the new york times as a " mystical experience , " where " the major part was pure distress at all the memories i had successfully forgotten for decades . " " we want to break these substances out of the mold of the counterculture , " doblin says . " we 'll ask you to re-enter your password when you access these services . what if i 'm on a computer that i share with others ? if you 're using a public computer or you share this computer with others , we recommend that you uncheck .
