a video that features ants over the boundaries of freedom of expression in a city known for its art . the exhibit , entitled " a fire in my belly , a work in progress , " was produced by david wojnarowicz , who died in 1992 after suffering from aids . it began screening saturday at the new museum , which is devoted exclusively to contemporary art , according to the museum website . " i think that in the artistic community , directors , curators are tremendously insensitive to christians , they respond by claiming victim status and i find it appalling , " said catholic league president bill donohue . " someone who did n't see it , called it in , put pressure and they pulled it . if you pull one piece how do you know another would n't be pulled . that 's censorship . " the video is currently displayed in the museum 's lobby and can be viewed free of charge . the video was recently removed from a smithsonian exhibit after donohue led protests against it and petitioned congress to cut the institution 's funding after it presented the video .
