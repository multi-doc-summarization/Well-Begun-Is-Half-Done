president obama reviewed the draft of a speech he was scheduled to give on economic inequality , he sent it back with a request : he wanted his speechwriter to add a quote from pope francis 's recent letter to the catholic church . " some of you may have seen just last week , the pope himself spoke about this at eloquent length . ‘ how could it be , ' he wrote , ‘ that it ’ s not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure , but it is news when the stock market loses two points ? " he wrote . " across the developed world , inequality has increased , " obama said in the dec. 4 speech , per the washington post . " i know that the holy father is anticipating the visit of president obama here , and the president is looking forward to coming here to meet with him. , " he said . " how it 's true that the pope is the head of the vatican state , that ’ s hardly his primary role . in benedict ’ s case , obama acknowledged only political parity , not moral authority . with francis , though , things are clearly different . by quoting him in that december address , obama deferred to francis as a moral exemplar—and a model for action of a decidedly temporal nature . this only 50 years after john f. kennedy , soon to be america ’ s first and only catholic president , declared that he wouldn ’ t take orders from the pope .
