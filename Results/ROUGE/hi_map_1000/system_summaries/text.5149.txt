" it feels like i live on planes , so when jetblue approached me to be part of this charity auction i jumped at the chance , " he said . " you have to see why something as mundane as kaczynski 's hand saw might be selling for much more than its actually worth . " the film 's office is currently holding an online auction of the personal effects of ted kaczynski , who , between 1978 and 1995 , engaged in a mail bombing spree , killing three people and injuring 23 others . the top bid for a hand-bowed wood saw that kaczynski used is currently only $ 310 , while handwritten letters to his aunt frida are only getting bids around $ 250 . of course , some people might say it 's a sad sign of the times that the auction is even taking place , and you wo n't get an argument from art historian and appraiser elyse luray , who is best known for her work on the pbs series " history detectives .
