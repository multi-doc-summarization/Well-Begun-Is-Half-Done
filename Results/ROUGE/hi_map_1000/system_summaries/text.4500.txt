david letterman is the first teaser trailer for the series , but it 's not clear that the show will stream monthly with the first episode launching on friday , jan. 12 , and the former president 's first talk-show appearance since leaving the cbs show in may 2015 , reports the hollywood reporter . " i 'm tired of people saying , 'can you believe he… ' and 'oh , my god , what has he done… . ' i want to put an end to that . ... what we need now is somebody like myself to sit down with him a or person b , sooner or later there 's going to be something funny that happens or is said that is either in context of a greater topic or adjunct to him and listen to him ? does he have pets ? why does he want to behave like this ? if he wants to be a hero , why not do something that has some humanity to it ? i do n't know that he 'd be the prototypical guest but , by god , would n't you like an hour to just look at this guy and then have him leave the white house .
