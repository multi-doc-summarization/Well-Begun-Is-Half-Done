google ceo of the company 's main google business , an equity award valued at nearly $ 200 million , making him the highest paid chief executive in the us . pichai , who became google 's ceo in october following its reorganisation into holding company alphabet , was handed to lure her away from morgan stanley last year . diane greene , who has been head of google ’ s cloud computing business since november , was awarded shares worth $ 42.8m . that is still well below the stakes held by co-founders larry page and sergey brin , and eric schmidt , alphabet ’ s executive chairman , who was hired several years after the company started . however , the grant was valued at $ 199 million , though subsequent declines in alphabet shares put the current value at about $ 182 million . the new shares takes the value of pichai ’ s alphabet holdings to roughly $ 600 million . that 's not clear whether google 's award is worth more than the net worth of google 's former ceo , eric page , who holds shares worth about $ 38m . this was on top of $ 148m worth she was granted last year following google 's takeover of bebop technologies , a tech company she founded .
