a male black widow spider has adopted up as a tasty of male widow spiders , and it 's a little bit twisted . new research published in biology letters shows that some males are employing a rather unsettling strategy to prevent this from happening , but it ’ s a completely selfish act but also one that improves an individual male ’ s reproductive success . as the researchers from university of toronto scarborough point out , they found that one-third of them had been violated in this way . he then very carefully deposits his seed in the female ’ s sperm receptacle , called spermatheca . " the male has to be precise about the timing , doing it just a few days before molting when the female 's genitalia and sperm storage organs are fully developed but not yet exposed . spider sex with minors isn ’ t causing any injury to the female , " he writes . " it will become more popular over time . sexual cannibalism evolved for a reason , so this kind of sexual experimentation may be peaking . for now , it remains a fetish among a species already known for its extreme and violent sex acts .
