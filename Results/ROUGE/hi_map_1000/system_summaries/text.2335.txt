scott kelly is 2 inches taller after spending nearly a year in space he 's about to reunite with his twin brother in houston since his return to earth , the ap reports . nasa 's jeff williams told cnn that scott kelly grew 2 inches during his time aboard the international space station it was expected , and it 's temporary , williams said . " astronauts get taller in space as the spine elongates , " williams says . " it ’ s not statistically valid to say that differences between them must be due to the spaceflight. , " he said , per the washington post . kelly 's twin brother made him a perfect candidate for such a mission , but it 's a weird but temporary side effect of spaceflight . but even if kelly hadn ’ t had his vitals checked immediately upon landing , he might have noticed the slight height change : one of the first earthlings he saw was his identical twin , retired astronaut mark kelly — a man now notably , if only temporarily , shorter . nasa scientists already knew that kelly would walk a little taller when he emerged from the soyuz capsule . but astronauts actually have stayed in space for months longer than that : back in the pre-iss days of russia 's mir station , several cosmonauts broke this record .
