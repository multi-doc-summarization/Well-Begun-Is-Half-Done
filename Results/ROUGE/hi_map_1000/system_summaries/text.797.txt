a diner was kicked out of a restaurant not for something she did , but apparently for a restaurant to have a twitter account . " any business is allowed to set the tone of their establishment , " he said . " if you go to someone 's house and start calling them names , i would n't really expect to stay too much longer after that . " the customer called the bartender a " twerp " on twitter , and the manager showed her to leave . " i immediately called up here and talked to her for a few minutes and asked her if she had any kinder words , " she says . " you have that other dimension of depth , the twitterverse . but just as quickly as they could say something offensive and negative . " she also called the bar and asked to speak to the customer . over the phone , he asked him a twerp , " left down house in tears after the gm called up and asked the bartender to hand me the phone . he proceeded to curse a me & ask me to leave . <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
