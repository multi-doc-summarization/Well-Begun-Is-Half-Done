san diego city council on monday voted unanimously to ban drinking on mission bay in an effort to stop the " floatopia " parties , at which hundreds of college-age people drink while floating on rafts , inner-tubes and other devices , are a menace and could lead to drownings because of drunkenness and injuries from broken bottles . but opponents of the ban said that further limitations on drinking could hurt tourism . the council was not swayed by that argument . " this is the best day ever , that 's all i have to say , " said chris ball , captain of the san diego police department 's northern division . " if you slip off and the first deep breath you take is seawater , chances are you 're not coming back up , " he said . " that 's what we 're concerned about . " nobody has drowned so far . most of san diego 's floatopias happen in and around pacific beach—known as p.b.—a young , raucous neighborhood of bungalows and a two-mile-long strip of bars that ends at the pacific ocean . back when beach drinking was still allowed , p.b . on monday , the full council is expected to vote on making it " unlawful for any bather to consume any alcoholic beverage within one marine league of any beach .
