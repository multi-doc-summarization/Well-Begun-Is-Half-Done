president obama is assad 's closest ally , but it 's not clear that the president had to use the meeting of the group of 20 nations to build pressure on congress as it considers whether to authorize the use of military force . " this would not be another iraq or afghanistan , " he said . " but there is a dialogue . we hear each other , we understand arguments , but we do n't agree with them . " obama 's plan for what obama has called " a decade of war , even as the war in iraq has ended , and the american public on the need for a military response , " obama said in a news conference . " we can not turn a blind eye to images like the ones we 've seen out of syria . " he added , " i know that the american people are weary down . that 's why we 're not putting our troops in the middle of somebody else 's war . " the president has been enthused in a nationally televised address on tuesday , though he 's not want to enter into another costly and protracted war .
