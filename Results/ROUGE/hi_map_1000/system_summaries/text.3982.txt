hillary clinton was calm , cool and collected at thursday and an effective tie in iowa the week before she was fresh off a resounding loss in new hampshire on tuesday , the ap reports . clinton could n't be understandably on edge , as well as three who wound up weaker . both candidates , ultimately , delivered on their key themes , played up their key strengths , and likely pleased their key supporters . and they fought not just over who would win the nomination but also to a considerable degree over how we should understand both the future and the past of the democratic party . so here are all considered areas of relative weakness for the income inequality-focused sanders , though the reality is that she did n't need to . playing small ball and successfully turning the debate into a series of tedious , hard-to-follow exchanges is good enough for the candidate who currently enjoys a large lead in national polls . recall that outside of the hothouse of internet commentary , most democrats currently have a favorable view of both candidates and wasting his time on petty one-liners . clinton also effectively cast sanders as insufficiently loyal to president obama , a point that will resound with black voters among whom obama remains extremely popular . clinton was helped by the dearth of questions about uncomfortable topics for her ( paid speeches , state department investigations ) ; when pressed on her super pac being financed heavily by a few individuals , clinton was uncomfortable and gave one of her worst answers of the night .
