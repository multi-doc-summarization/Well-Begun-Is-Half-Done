president bashar al-assad will be the ninth direct western military intervention in an arab or muslim country in 15 years , reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether it 's a civil war in a broken country , but it 's the first time that will be a " coalition of the action as the us assembles yet another " coalition . " we ’ re getting dragged in anyway , and everything we worried about has come to pass : the war has spread and destabilized lebanon , jordan , iraq and turkey . the hard-line nusra front rebels have gained strength , partly because we have spurned moderates , " he writes . " there have been calls for the president to reconvene congress and put this one before them , and such calls are right . it might even help the administration figure out what , exactly , it hopes to accomplish by shooting missiles in the general direction of damascus . having people , representatives , raise their hands before you do something is not an empty ritual , even when they don ’ t vote the way you want them to . britain ’ s policy toward syria has failed , and it ’ s time to try a tougher approach . obama reportedly rejected a proposal from hillary clinton and david petraeus to arm rebels in syria , because he feared getting dragged into the conflict . if credibility were the cause , washington need do no more than start dismantling the potemkin village it has made of the principles it tediously mouths.but this thought goes nowhere these days .
