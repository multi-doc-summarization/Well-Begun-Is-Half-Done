myanmar started releasing nearly 70 political prisoners tuesday , just days after the president promised during a european tour to free all who remain behind bars by the end of the year . the continued incarceration of prisoners of conscience in myanmar , which is in the process of opening up following decades of isolation and brutal military rule , has been a key concern of the united states and other western nations . president thein sein , a former general now heading a quasi-civilian government , has pushed through a series of political and economic reforms since a military government stepped aside in 2011 . he has freed hundreds of political detainees and promised in a speech in britain last week to honor a commitment made by the president during a recent trip to europe , a member of a government body looking into the process said on tuesday . " the total number of remaining political prisoners has now dropped to lower than 100 for the first time in many years , " he said . " it 's important to remember that many still remain in prison and all the repressive laws that put them there are still in place . "
