a miami intellectual property attorney filed a trademark request for the word " jeb ! " has been abandoned . jeb bush announced he was running for president , according to the just-released cnn/orc poll , which was filed by a group apparently aligned with bush to reserve its exclusive right to use his name . " better known as jeb : jeb ! , of course , is the preferred wordmark for one john ellis bush , and when he was governor he used this term to motivate the process , but for now the name is not trademarked and open for anyone else to try to grab , " he writes . " the trademark was n't terribly valuable anyway because there 's not really any money to be made from selling anything with jeb ! on it . this ai n't nike . anyway , if you want to make poor jeb : ( even sadder , you 're now apparently free to sell your own jeb ! mousepads . " ) bush 's campaign did n't respond to a request for comment , but it 's not clear whether he 's been abandoned , reports the new york daily news . " you can buy lots of jeb ! stuff at the jeb ! campaign store , but people clearly are n't buying enough of it , " writes <unk> . " it wasn â€™ t until bush , as a declared candidate , filed his financial disclosure form in july that the world learned he directly owned bhag . as we discovered this summer , bhag was an acronym for big hairy audacious goal .
