chicago police said charges could be announced soon in the fatal shooting of an illinois congressman 's grandson following an argument over a pair of basketball shoes . officer michelle tannehill said two juveniles are in custody and are considered suspects in the killing of 15-year-old javon wilson , who was shot in the head at his home in chicago on friday . wilson is the grandson of longtime u.s. rep. danny davis . " the detectives are with them and charges are expected , but we don â€™ t have their ages or genders until the charges are approved , " tannehill said . " it becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change . " davis said he was told that a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with wilson 's 14-year-old brother , but thought better of the trade and went to wilson 's house with a 17-year-old girl . he said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with wilson before the boy pulled a gun and fired . davis , a democratic member of the house for 20 years , told the associated press on saturday that his grandson was a victim of a world where gun violence has become commonplace .
