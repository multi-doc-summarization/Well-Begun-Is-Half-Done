washington navy yard shooter aaron alexis obtained a secret-level security clearance after a federal personnel report failed to mention that a 2004 arrest involved a firearm , the navy said monday . a senior navy official told reporters the service learned of the incident 's violent nature only after alexis had shot 12 people to death at the washington navy navy yard last week and was himself fatally shot by police . the office of personnel management knew of alexis ' seattle arrest because of a fingerprint check when he joined the navy reserve in 2007 and interviewed him about it , the official said . alexis had complained that he was hearing voices and being bombarded by microwaves . because of his job , which required a security clearance , he had a valid id card that allowed him to enter the navy yard . " the summary of the seattle incident that was provided to [ the navy ] makes no reference to firearms , " the navy official says . " in a vacuum looking back , what we do know is that the events suggest very different activity . " alexis was found to be eligible for the security clearance in march 2008 after the navy reviewed the personnel investigation .
