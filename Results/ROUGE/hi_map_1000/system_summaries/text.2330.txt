an early warning system that might have prevented some deaths in the tsunami that hit an indonesian island on friday has been stalled in the testing phase for years . the high-tech system of seafloor sensors , data-laden sound waves and fiber-optic cable was meant to replace a system set up after an earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 250,000 people in the region in 2004 . but inter-agency wrangling and delays in getting just 1 billion rupiah ( $ 69,000 ) to complete the project mean the system has n't moved beyond a prototype developed with $ 3 million from the us national science foundation . it is too late for central sulawesi , where walls of water up to 6 meters ( 20 feet ) high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in a dozen countries , more than half of them in the indonesian province of aceh , a concerted international effort was launched to improve tsunami warning capabilities , particularly in the indian ocean and for indonesia , one of world 's most earthquake and tsunami-prone countries . " it 's a heartbreak to watch when there is a well-designed sensor network that could provide critical information , " she said . " they do n't take into account multiple events , multiple quakes within a short period of time . " the tsunami and geophysics agency issued a tsunami alert , warning of potential for waves of 0.5 to 3 feet ) . " to me this is a tragedy for science , even more
