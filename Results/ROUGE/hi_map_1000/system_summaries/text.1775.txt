a woman who won only a bit of yard in a divorce settlement , while her ex got the rest of the property , the real estate agent tells yahoo homes . " i ca n't imagine why else someone would build a house like that if it was n't out of spite , " he said . " we had quite the interest ! " she says the home , which is currently up for sale , was originally built in 1925 , the bbc reports . legend has it that a wife put it up after a judge awarded her husband their house and her just the front yard in the divorce . but that 's not true . it went up in 1925 ; the next-door neighbor who wanted the sliver of land it sits on made the landowner such a low offer that he responded by building the little house right up in the neighbor 's face . the listing agent describes it best when she says it was a " malicious erection , " and that the neighbor was " a step beyond anger . " the neighbor notes that the house , which the home was " just 4.5 feet wide and the front is only 15 feet , " says the owner of the home . " it happens when anger has hardened exterior walls garish colors , posted unsightly signs and tried other ways to pique the people nearby . but it 's expensive , and now in dangerous territory , you nevertheless ca n't stop , and you decide it needs a monument . what you do next is inescapably , pigheadedly wrongâ€”and also epically right . you build a spite house .
