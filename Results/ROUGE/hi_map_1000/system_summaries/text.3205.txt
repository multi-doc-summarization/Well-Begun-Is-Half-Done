pope francis finds the catholic church 's opposition to gay marriage on wednesday , but suggested in a newspaper interview that it could support some types of civil unions . the pope reiterated the church 's longstanding teaching that " marriage is between a man and a woman . " however , he said , " we have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety . " states , for instance , justify civil unions as a way to provide economic security to cohabitating couples , the pope said in a wide-ranging interview published wednesday in corriere della sera , an italian daily . state-sanctioned unions are thus driven by the need to ensure rights like access to health care , francis added . a number of catholic bishops have supported civil unions for same-sex couples as an alternative to marriage , including pope francis when he was elected and praying in the nearby paoline chapel before he went out onto the balcony of st. peter 's basilica to greet the world with his famous " buonasera . " in his response to the interviewer , he emphasized the natural characteristic of marriage between one man and one woman , and on the other hand , he also spoke about the obligation of the state to fulfill its responsibilities towards its citizens . " if i 'm not mistaken , sigmund freud in every idealization there 's an aggression . depicting the pope as a sort of superman , a star , is offensive to me . "
