brazilian authorities reached a deal with rioting prisoners monday who killed four fellow inmates , beheading two of them , and held two guards hostage . elson faxina , a spokesman for the parana state attorney 's office , said an agreement was signed to end the uprising at the cascavel city correctional facility and that prisoners were currently being transferred to another jail . " after that , the two guards who were held hostage will be freed , " faxina said . " for us , the situation is tense now but we hope it is resolved . a jail of this kind needs investment . " he said the inmates were demanding improved facilities , better quality food and more flexible visiting hours . " many times the workers have to invest their money to buy the necessary items to do their jobs , " the union said in a statement . " without investment , we are always exposed to this . the prisoners claim that food is bad , that there are no lawyers to process things , minimal hygiene products do n't exist , there are few correctional officers . all the factors together are a tragedy waiting to happen .
