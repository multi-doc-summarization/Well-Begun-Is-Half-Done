a new study finds that researchers have discovered the earliest known prehistoric ancestor of humans , a microscopic , bag-like sea creature , which lived about 540 million years ago . named saccorhytus , after the sack-like features created by its elliptical body and large mouth , is likely a deuterostome , a group that includes all vertebrates , including humans , and some invertebrates , such as starfish . saccorhytus was about a millimetre ( 0.04 inches ) long , and likely lived between grains of sand on the seabed during the early cambrian period . while the mouth ons was carried out by an international team of academics , including researchers from the university of cambridge , said in a statement , " to the naked eye , the fossils we studied look like tiny black grains , but under the microscope the level of detail is jaw-dropping . all deuterostomes had a common ancestor , and we think that is what we are looking at here . " the study notes that the creature is thought to find any evidence that the animal had an anus , which suggests that it consumed food and excreted from the same orifice .
