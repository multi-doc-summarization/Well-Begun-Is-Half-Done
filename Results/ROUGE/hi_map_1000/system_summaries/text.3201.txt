scientists are reporting on a new virus , never seen before anywhere , that apparently killed a kansas man last year . they â€™ re calling it bourbon virus , after the county in kansas where the previously healthy man lived . he 's d been bitten by ticks before he got sick so doctors believe the virus is carried by ticks . " we were not looking for a new <unk> , " says charles hunt , kansas state epidemiologist . " it is possible that other persons have been infected with this and not known it . " the research team is not giving details on the man other than that he was healthy , under the age of 50 and working outdoors on his property in eastern kansas last spring when he came inside with tick bites and one fat tick still on his shoulder . he just got sicker , and blood tests cleared him of the usual tickborne illnesses such as rocky mountain spotted fever , lyme disease , or ehrlichiosis . his heart started to fail and then his kidneys , and he died 11 days after illness onset from cardiopulmonary arrest . molecular and serologic testing results for a presumed tickborne illness . doctors tested his blood for all sorts of infections , from tularemia and q fever to fungal infections such as aspergillosis .
