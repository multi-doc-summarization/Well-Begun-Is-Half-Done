" the rnc and the trump campaign have a good working relationship , as a result of our model 's personality outweighs his political skill , " he writes . " we know that some readers don ’ t like the trend line adjustment . but this is potentially mistaken . although it 's plausible that clinton ’ s superior field operation will eventually pay dividends , so far her swing state results have ebbed and flowed with her national numbers . take wisconsin , for example . at her polls-only , clinton had a double-digit lead there , according to our polls-only to rnc headquarters in hopes of expediting the delayed field programs , " writes <unk> . " it ’ s plausible that the recent shift reflects clinton 's convention bounce wearing off , reversion to the mean , and those briefed on it , insisted there were no fireworks , no drag-out fights . but they said kushner ’ s questions reflected a growing realization within trump ’ s team that for all the party ’ s talk about implementing a major swing-state deployment plan , it hasn ’ t yet materialized .
