the man in black 's boyhood home has been added to the national register of historic places . the arkansas democrat-gazette reports that the house is owned by arkansas state university , which spent $ 575,000 to buy , restore , furnish and landscape the property . cash died in 2003 at age 71 after an incredibly successful musical career . it was nominated in december , but a national register historian sent that nomination back to the arkansas historic preservation program in january saying more emphasis should be placed on dyess ' influence on cash 's development as a musician . " the original nomination form presented a wealth of information about cash and his family , and simply needed to be tweaked to justify listing it for that significance , " gabbert said friday . " when we grew up , it was second nature that we would n't live in dyess when we were grown . " he said it was " a little bit of bureaucratic cleanup " that would likely result in the house eventually being listed on the person 's formative years . " it 's great that the childhood home of one of america 's greatest songwriters and entertainers has achieved national recognition and even better that it has been restored so that people can visit it and walk in the footsteps of johnny cash , " christ said .
