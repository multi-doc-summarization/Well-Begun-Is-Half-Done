researchers from georgetown university medical center and american university have shown that the left brain is better at processing fast sounds , and the right processing slow ones . the scientists say their study , published in frontiers of neuroscience , opens a pathway to studying bat brains in order to understand certain human language disorders and potentially even improving computer speech recognition . " the slower timing of the right hemisphere may allow us to identify who is speaking , to gauge their emotional state via tone-of-voice and to tease out pitch in music , which is thought to be important for getting groups of people to coordinate their activities and can ultimately lead to the formation of cultures , " washington says . " it is therefore reasonable to understand why humans needed to evolve this asymmetry in their brains . " for mustached bats , the need is even more compelling , he said . " these findings upset the notion that only humans use different sides of their brains to distinguish communication sounds from each other , because their communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency . otherwise , they can not communicate with other bats , and bats are even more social than humans .
