a boil-water alert flint officials issued tuesday remains in effect at least until bacteria testing is completed thursday afternoon , the ap reports . flint is under a boil-water advisory after a large water transmission line adjacent to dort highway broke tuesday , which led to a water main break on dupont , city officials say . the break has since been contained , utilities administrator michael glasgow said in a statement wednesday . " the leak was completely isolated last night . water pressures should be back at normal operating levels across the city , " he said . " that figure could be a starting point , but we wo n't know for sure until we are able to study the pipes that are in place now and know better what needs to be replaced and how quickly . " a spokesman for the governor says the advisory is being called a precaution and will be lifted once water sampling shows the water is safe to drink . air and loose sediment may be trapped in the water lines , but residents are urged to not flush their system through filters since that could affect performance , according to the advisory . flint ’ s lead-contamination problems trace to the city 's switch to flint river water in april 2014 for its source of drinking water and the state ’ s failure to require corrosive controls .
