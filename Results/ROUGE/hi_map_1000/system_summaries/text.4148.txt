the study of 110 babies found that infants later diagnosed with autism showed a decline in the amount of attention they paid to other people 's eyes beginning at 2 months and continuing until 24 months . " we found that signs of autism are measurable and observable within the first months of life , " says study author warren jones . " these are the earliest signs of some early eye-looking , is important because , in the future , if we were able to use similar technologies to identify early signs of social disability , we could then consider interventions to build on that early eye-looking and help reduce some of the associated disabilities that often accompany autism , " he said . " this paper is a major leap forward . " the study , however , says that infants who had a high risk of autism because they were babies than children who did not develop autism . but contrary to what the researchers expected , the difference was not apparent at birth . it emerged in the next few months and autism experts said that might suggest a window during which the progression toward autism can be halted or slowed .
