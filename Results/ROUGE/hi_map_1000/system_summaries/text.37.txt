president obama and wall street has raised $ 1.5 million for the president , compared to 27 in obama 's first report , according to an analysis of campaign data released friday . " the emphasis has been on doing larger dollar fundraising events particularly asking for $ 2,500 , " corrado said . " events like this help him to raise substantial amounts of money for the campaign allowing him to exceed his pace for 2007 . " obama recently called himself the " underdog " in the race , but he has raised about $ 150 million in a single evening of fundraising , as supporters donate the legal maximum of $ 35,800 to his campaign and the democratic party for the chance to have dinner and take a picture with the president . ubs polls show that obama will have a tough time winning re-election next year . a campaign finance expert at colby college in maine has raised more than $ 1 million so far for his bid for a second term , far outstripping obama 's republican rivals . those figures do not account for all wall street giving , nor for the full force of each candidate 's program of tougher oversight and regulation as both necessary and beneficial to the industry in the long term . but fundraising prowess does n't guarantee victory for the incumbent , who is fighting for re-election amid a economic stagnation and high unemployment .
