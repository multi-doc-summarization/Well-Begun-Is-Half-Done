the headmaster of a connecticut high school has apologized after its football team named one of its plays " hitler . " debbie levison said the signal for the play was an index finger laid across the upper lip . the football team and coaches met with the connecticut anti-defamation league to make sure he had heard correctly . they told her to talk to the coach , which she did . " coach james briggs looked me in the eye and confirmed that they do indeed use a play called hitler , " he said . " there was a lack of understanding . this is not a situation where there was any intent to intimidate , or anti-semitism or anything like that. . " levison says she can ’ t understand why other adults who heard it in the past didn t think to object . selectman drew marzullo said friday it doesn ’ t even look abashed . the play apparently is not something that started this year . it has reportedly been sent home to greenwich high school parents . greenwich school officials also reached out to the local jewish community to express their apology . rabbi mitchell m. hurvitz of temple sholom on friday referred to the high school ’ s athletic code of conduct , which sets appropriate behaviors for student athletes to follow . they include : providing a positive image ; respecting the rights of opponents and spectators ; representing team , school and town with dignity .
