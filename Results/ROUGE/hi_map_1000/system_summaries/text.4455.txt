twitter is abuzz with reactions to a tell-all posted anonymously today by a philadelphia man claiming to have gone home with delaware senate candidate on halloween night three years ago , following a night of drinking . " if it was any politician whose private life diverged from his public life in such an interesting way , we 'd be interested in that , " stern said . " i barely knew christine when she turned up at my door at around eight o'clock on the night of halloween . we 'd met for the first and only time three months earlier when my two roommates and i signed the lease on our apartment : christine 's aunt owned the place we were moving into , and she happened to be up from delaware visiting at the time . but we 'd only spent about five minutes together that day and we had n't spoken much , and i had n't thought of her since . yet here she was standing outside my door with a friend . and both of them were pretty tipsy . she asked if she and her friend could come inside our apartment to change into their costumes . she could n't change at her aunt 's place , she said , because she was sleeping and she did n't want to wake her up . would we mind if she used our bathroom instead ? it was a pretty strange request .
