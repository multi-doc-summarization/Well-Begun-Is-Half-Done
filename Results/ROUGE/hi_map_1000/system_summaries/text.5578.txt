david blankenhorn , a national figure in the movement against same-sex marriage , has written a thoughtful short essay for the new york times on why he has devoted considerable effort to defeating gay marriage and emphasize the good that it can do . i opposed gay marriage believing that children have the right , insofar as society makes it possible , to know and to be cared for by the two parents who brought them into this world . " the time for denigrating or stigmatizing same-sex relationships is over. , " he said . " he has played a huge role in elevating the debate , in getting the right to take it more seriously , and in pioneering civil discussion . along with jon rauch , he really tried to find common ground , rather than polarize or hyperbolize . and i think many involved in this intellectual combat can be proud of themselves for maintaining greater civility than exists in many other emotional , personal debates . in the grass roots it can get brutal , as it can online . but the arguments we 've had in person have been usually civil . jon corvino 's book with maggie gallagher is an example of this , as is their dog-and-pony show on the debate circuit .
