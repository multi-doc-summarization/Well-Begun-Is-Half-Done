a federal judge in california on friday ordered a three-month delay in the lawsuit brought by the pornographic film star stephanie clifford against president trump and his attorney michael cohen will take a 90-day break while events play out in a criminal investigation in new york . fbi agents working on that probe raided cohen 's home and office looking for documents related to the daniels nondisclosure agreement . cohen had worked out a deal with daniels that kept her from talking about a sexual encounter she says she had with trump in 2006 . she signed the agreement with cohen just before the 2016 election , and cohen says he paid her $ 130,000 to stay quiet . now she wants the court to invalidate that arrangement . judge james otero is justice denied . # basta wood refused to let trump 's attorneys review cohen 's seized documents to see if they should be returned because they are secret under attorney-client privilege . wood appointed a " special master " to review which of material will be available to prosecutors , and which will be withheld . " this is no simple criminal investigation ; it is an investigation into the personal attorney of a sitting president regarding documents that might be subject to the attorney-client privilege , " he said . " whether or not an indictment is forthcoming , and the court thinks it likely based on these facts alone , these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay. . "
