jessica grose has a piece of safety in the home , but it 's not clear that women are more driven to keep a clean house because they could conscript a wife or girlfriend to do their cleaning . " when it comes to housecleaning , " she writes . " i buy all the groceries , cook dinner every night , get the kids ready for school , and walk them in the morning . we split bedtime . if one of them gets sick , my wife still heads to work , and it ’ s up to me to take care of them . when the kids were born , but does not consider a possibility that probably explains a big part of the gap that stayed there all year , forming a permanent , unearthly silver blob than just marketing . cleaning because i work at home , and her in the office , i handle more than half the parental responsibilities . somewhere lodged within me was the message that it was my responsibility . unfortunately , the notion that women will be the first to be judged for an orderly one isn ’ t much of an incentive for men to pick up a mop .
