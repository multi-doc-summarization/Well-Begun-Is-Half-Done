donald trump acknowledged thursday that he " could have " signaled support for invading iraq during a 2002 interview with howard stern . " it was probably the first time i was asked that question , " the gop presidential front-runner tells cnn . " but the fact is , if we decide a strike against iraq is necessary , it is madness not to carry the mission to its conclusion . when we do n't , we have the worst of all worlds : iraq remains a threat , and now has more incentive than ever to attack us . " trump 's comments on stern are more in line with what he wrote in his 2000 book , the america we deserve , where he advocated for a " principled and tough " policy toward " outlaw " states like iraq . " i would probably say that something was going on , " trump said . " nobody asked me that . i built a great company , i employed thousands of people . so i 'm not a politician . but if you look at 2003 , there are articles . if you 're in the private sector , you get asked things , i was really against .
