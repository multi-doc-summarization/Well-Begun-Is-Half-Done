actress amy adams pulled a first-class move on friday during a flight from detroit to los angeles when she gave up her prime seating to an american serviceman who was also on her delta flight . " once we boarded , i saw she was in first class . i was upgraded to first class and she was a couple rows behind me . i think she must have said something to the flight attendant , because before we took off she had vacated her seat , " hill said . " i did n't do it for attention for myself . i did it for the troops . " adams , 39 , took his seat in coach during their flight from the plane , and she gave her first class seat to him , but a flight attendant tells hill that the man did indeed chat privately with adams near the front of the plane . " when we were waiting to board , i 'm a bigger one after today , " she tweeted . " we boarded her latest oscar nomination this past year for her role . " hill also said that adams ' new seat on the delta flight was in coach . a representative for the actress has not yet responded to today.com 's request for comment â€” and hill did n't want to bother the sleeping serviceman during the flight .
