pregnancy affects not only a woman 's body : it changes parts of her brain too , a new study says . when researchers compared brain scans of women before and after pregnancy , they spotted some differences in 11 locations . they also found hints that the alterations help women prepare for motherhood . for example , they might help a mother understand the needs of her infant , elseline hoekzema , a neuroscientist , began working on the study while at the autonomous university of barcelona in spain . she and colleagues present the results in a paper released monday by the journal nature neuroscience . the women were consistent : a computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the mri scans . and the changes , first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth , were mostly still present two years after childbirth . that 's based on follow-up with 11 study participants . further work showed they 're a motherhood thing : no brain changes were seen in first-time fathers . women trying to become pregnant were scanned in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle or before the insemination or transfer in the fertility-treated group . only participants who had never experienced a previous pregnancy beyond the first trimester were included in the study .
