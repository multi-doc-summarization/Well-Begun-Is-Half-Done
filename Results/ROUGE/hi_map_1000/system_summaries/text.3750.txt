ucla geochemists have found evidence that life likely existed on earth at least 4.1 billion years ago , or about 300 million years earlier than previously thought , according to a team of u.s. researchers . scientists from stanford university and the university of california , los angeles said they recently collected some 10,000 multibillion year-old zircons in jack hills , australia , including one believed to contain a carbon deposit that 's large craters 3.9 years ago . " if all life on earth died during this bombardment , which some scientists have argued , then life must have restarted quickly , " said mark harrison , co-author of the research and a professor of the national academy of sciences . " with the right ingredients , life seems to form very quickly. . " in the online early edition of the journal proceedings of the inner solar system that formed the moon ’ s history has been dubbed the hadean , and found both graphite flecks had a high carbon-12 to carbon-13 isotope ratio , a characteristic feature of organic origins as life preferentially absorbs carbon-12 . it is generally thought that conditions on earth before then were so extreme that life wouldn ’ t have stood a chance of survival .
