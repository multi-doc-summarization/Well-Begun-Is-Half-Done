the son of italian immigrants to argentina , francis is the first latin american to be elected pope six days ago , the new york times reports . " he must open his arms to protect all of god â€™ s people and embrace with tender affection the whole of humanity , especially the poorest , the weakest , the stranger , the sick and those in need , who are often the last we think about , " he said . " the ring is not solid gold like that of his predecessors and respecting the environment in which we live . it means protecting people , showing loving concern for each and every person , especially children , the elderly , those whom matthew lists in the final judgment on love : the least important , those in prison. . " francis , however , has been accused by some critics in argentina of not doing enough to oppose human rights abuses under a military government during the 1976-1983 " dirty war " when some 30,000 leftists were kidnapped and killed . the mass , formally installing francis as head of the world 's 1.2 billion roman catholics , was much simpler and an hour shorter than the lowly and sick , as well as the natural world . he reflected first on the symbolism of the date : this is the day that catholics celebrate the feast of st. joseph to honor jesus ' father on earth , the pope emeritus and former cardinal joseph ratzinger , whose decision to step down last month shook the catholic world .
