megyn kelly threw a lot of shade at anchor megyn kelly in a tweet wednesday night , saying she " clearly " supports hillary clinton . the tweet was apparently in response to kelly 's comments earlier in the evening on the kelly file when she accused both presidential candidates of avoiding tough interviews . " they 're both in their own version of a presidential protection program , " kelly said . " @ megynkelly u should be mad at @ hillaryclinton clearly you support her . and @ realdonaldtrump did talk to u . " trump makes sure " she is not in a place where she feels uncomfortable or anything unexpected could come at her , which is why she sat for a half an hour with mary j. blige , the singer , which does n't exactly extend the tent . " kelly has made several appearances on hannity 's show and the fox news personality has been a vocal supporter of trump . " but , kelly did n't stop there , " hannity tweeted . " clearly you . when they stand by me . " he said clinton 's admonishment was also directed at the democratic nominee .
