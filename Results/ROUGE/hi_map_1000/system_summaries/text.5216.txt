the united states is withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal , which he is planning to reinstall sanctions on the iranian regime . he says in an address to the nation that he will be reinstituting the highest level of sanctions and warning any country not to help the iranian government . trump says america " will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail " and will not allow " a regime that chants maintaining that obama gave up too much for too little . his decision signals a dramatic reversal of u.s. policy , and his rhetoric was hawkish . the move also raises two important questions for the trump administration and the international community : whether iran will respond by resuming its frozen weapons program . " " it is clear to me that we can not prevent an iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement , " trump said in a nationally televised statement from the white house . " in a democracy , there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one administration to the next , " he said . " the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding america 's credibility , and puts us at odds with the world 's major powers . "
