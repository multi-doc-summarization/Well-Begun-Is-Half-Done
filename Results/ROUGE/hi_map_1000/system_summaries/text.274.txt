donald trump came under fire friday morning for his handling of a question at a town hall about when the u.s. can " get rid " of muslims , for failing to take issue with that premise and an assertion that president obama is muslim . trump , who has shaken off several high-profile controversies that would have ended other presidential campaigns , faced an immediate backlash from advocacy groups , and members of his own party distanced themselves from the gop front-runner . the incident recalls trump 's 2011 quest to challenge obama on where he was born , which ended with obama releasing his long-form birth certificate . it also follows a debate performance wednesday that garnered mixed reviews for the billionaire businessman . " i do n't know if trump is using dog-whistle politics to win support in the polls , or if he genuinely believes the racist things he says . either way , he showed a complete lack of moral courage in that clip , and he has shown once again that he completely unqualified to be president of the united states , " he said . " you know , a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening . we 're going to be looking at that and many other things . "
