apple maps a specially van with scanning equipment registered to apple was spotted on the streets of new york and san francisco , the ap reports . the people carrier with system of 12 cameras and a lidar sensor , which scans the environment using a spinning laser , attached to its roof was spotted by a bay area local blog called claycord news and talk . the unmarked vehicle was confirmed as having been leased to apple via its number plate , and it could indicate that the company is preparing a large update to its maps app for the iphone and ipad , ios 9 , is expected to debut in the summer and could introduce the new feature . that would require a significant investment from apple and a fleet of cars to photograph and map roads . apple maps was notoriously buggy with inaccurate data on its launch in 2012 , prompting the chief executive tim cook to publicly apologise for user frustration between vehicles and automatically apply the brakes on a car . it ’ s possible that apple is using lidar to create its own street view rival , or at least testing that scenario . apple ’ s self-driving vehicles are clearly marked , which means this appears to be coming from another company other than google .
