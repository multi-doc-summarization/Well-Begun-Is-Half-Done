a young woman went blind in one eye within 24 hours after catching a flesh-eating bacteria during a mud run on monday with her fiancé , started experiencing severe pain and vision loss in her left eye . she was seen at the er that night and told that she has several abrasions on her cornea and likely needs more antibiotics to prevent the bacteria from spreading throughout her bloodstream . brittany williams said her eye started hurting badly just hours after competing in the mud run earlier this month in dallas . her cornea is deteriorating rapidly and although she has a team of specialists looking after her and deciding what steps should be taken next , it 's still unsure whether or not they can save her eye . all of this is obviously going to cost the family quite a bit of money and any amount donated would help them out during this difficult time and make a world of difference . " i ’ ve had health insurance before and i never used it . i never went to the doctor and i just spent lots of money for nothing . so i didn ’ t see the point at the time when we couldn ’ t afford it , " said brittany williams , who finished her first mud run two weeks ago . " when i opened my eye , it was just like white . the whole room was white. . "
