the norwegian man charged saturday with a pair of attacks in oslo that killed at least 92 people left behind a detailed manifesto outlining his preparations and calling for a christian war to defend europe against the threat of muslim domination , according to norwegian and american officials familiar with the investigation . as stunned norwegians with the deadliest attack in the country since world war ii , a portrait began to emerge of the suspect , anders behring breivik , 32 . the police identified him as a right-wing fundamentalist christian , while acquaintances described him as the threats of multiculturalism and muslim immigration . " we are not sure whether he was alone or had help , " a police official , roger andresen , said at a televised news conference . " what we know is that he is right wing and a christian fundamentalist. . " the document also describes a secret meeting in london in april 2002 to reconstitute the knights templar , a crusader military order . it says the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight european countries , evidently including mr. breivik , with an additional three members unable to attend , including a “ european-american. ” the document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of mr. breivik 's planned attacks , though investigators presumably will now try to determine if the people exist and what their connection is to mr. breivik .
