a grizzly bear that fatally mauled a hiker in yellowstone national park was killed after dna evidence linked the animal to the scene of a second hiker 's death a month later , a park official said monday . the decision to euthanize the 250-pound ( 113-kilogram ) female bear was meant to protect park visitors and staff , superintendent dan wenk said . " we made a decision at that time , based on all the information available , that we did not have a bear with a history or a bear that was demonstrating any predatory nature , " park spokesman al nash said . the deaths of matayoshi and wallace were the first blamed on a bear inside the park in a quarter-century . two fatal grizzlies live in the greater yellowstone area , which includes parts of wyoming , montana and wyoming . a recent report showed run-ins between humans and that growing bear population reached record levels last year , with 295 conflicts recorded by researchers . three of every four of those involved bears killing livestock or damaging property to get food , garbage , livestock feed or other human-related foods .
