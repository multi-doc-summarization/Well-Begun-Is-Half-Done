the european commission says it is " following up " two reports that raise concerns that software used in tvs appear to use less energy during official testing conditions than they do during real-world use , raising questions about whether they are set up to game energy efficiency tests , the ap reports . one study indicates that it used software that altered its televisions ' performance during tests , but said this was the effect of a general energy efficiency feature that came into effect during normal use and had nothing to do with the testing process . however , one environmental campaign group has likened the accusations to the volkswagen diesel scandal , in which the german car firm admitted to programming its cars to deliberately cheat emissions tests . " the laboratories observed different tv behaviours during the measurements and this raised the possibility of the tv ’ s detecting a test procedure and adapting their power consumption accordingly , " a samsung spokesman says . " this is not a setting that only activates during compliance testing . on the contrary , it is an ‘ out of the box ’ setting , which reduces power whenever video motion is detected . not only that , the content used for testing energy consumption has been designed by the international electrotechnical commission to best model actual average picture level .
