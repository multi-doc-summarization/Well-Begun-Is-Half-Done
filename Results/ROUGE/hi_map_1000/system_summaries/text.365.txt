a new three-year study released on tuesday reveals that students whose teachers were offered bonuses of up to $ 15,000 a year for improved test scores registered the same gains on standardized exams as those whose teachers received on the tennessee standardized exams . matthew springer , executive director of the vanderbilt center and lead researcher on the study , claiming it " only looked at the narrow question of whether more pay motivates teachers to try harder . " " i think most people agree today that the current way in which we compensate teachers is broken , " he said . " what we are trying to do is change the culture of teaching by giving all educators the feedback they need to get better while rewarding and incentivizing the best to teach in high-need schools , hard-to-staff subjects . " the study notes that the obama administration encourages school systems to link teacher pay and tenure to how students perform on tests and other measures of achievement . " merit pay is not the panacea that some would like it to be . there are no quick fixes in education , " says matthew springer . " it means pay ca n't do it alone . "
