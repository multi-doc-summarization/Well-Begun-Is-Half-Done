hillary clinton 's presidential campaign raised more than $ 28 million in the third fundraising quarter of 2015 , a number only slightly more than the $ 25 million bernie sanders raised . clinton 's third quarter fundraising brings her total haul to $ 75 million in six months , the ap reports . sanders ' fundraising is closing in on clinton , however , despite only ever headlining seven fundraisers as a candidate . michael briggs , sanders ' spokesman , said wednesday night that the campaign has expected her numbers to drop during the summer months , while she was dogged by questions about her email practices at the state department and falling poll numbers in the early-voting states . " we are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country , helping us raise a record $ 75 % in the first two quarters , " clinton 's campaign manager robby mook in a statement . the campaign 's joint fundraising committee with the democratic national committee and state parties brought in over $ 3 million , the campaign said . but sanders â€™ campaign said on wednesday that it had passed the one-million contributor mark in the second quarter , as he overtook clinton in polling in both new hampshire and iowa .
