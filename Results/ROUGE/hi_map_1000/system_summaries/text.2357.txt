struggling to advance his agenda in washington , president donald trump traveled to the midwest on wednesday for a raucous rally with his loyal supporters , the kind of event he relished before winning the white house . trump touched down wednesday evening in rainy cedar rapids , iowa , and headed to a local community college , where he got a look at agriculture technology innovations before leading a campaign rally . he reveled in georgia republican karen handel 's congressional victory in an election viewed as an early referendum on his presidency . " the truth is , people love us ... they have n't figured it out yet , " he said . " pretty good imagination , right ? it 's my ideas. . " he also applauded republican ralph norman , who notched a slimmer-than-expected win in a special election to fill the south carolina congressional seat vacated by mick mulvaney , and mocked handel 's challenger , jon ossoff , saying the democrats " spent $ 30 million on this kid who forgot to live in the district . " trump , no stranger to victory laps , turned his visit to a battleground state he captured in november into a celebration of his resilience despite the cloud of investigations that has enveloped a spirit of unity . but he did not sound optimistic about breaking through the partisan divide any time soon .
