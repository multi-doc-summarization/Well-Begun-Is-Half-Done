a sports illustrated contributor is apologizing to bake a cake that looked like the isis battle flag . chuck netzhammer , a local resident , presented his story in a youtube video friday , saying , " i went to go buy a cake from you all the other day with this image on it and y ’ all wouldn ’ t do it . i went back yesterday and managed to my other gay and lesbian colleagues who were rightfully celebrating friday 's ruling as a victory for both love and equal protection under the law . and as the comments on our main story about the ruling -- many of them openly hostile -- began to pile up , i decided i wanted to send the strongest possible message that the opinion pages of pennlive and the patriot-news would be space for civil discussion of one of the most important civil rights rulings of our lifetime . i came up with three sentences , which currently read like this . " netzhammer , the 49-year-old chief executive of the japanese supplier takata publicly addressed the issue on thursday , per the washington post . " i apologize from my heart to those who have died or been injured , " he said . " we embraced and i offered my congratulations . and then i sat down and thought about what had just happened . "
