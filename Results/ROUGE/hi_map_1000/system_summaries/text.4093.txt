a rat infestation in a government office in florida contaminated supplies that could have been sent to puerto rico hurricane victims . the water and food was moved into the premises despite officials knowing the office had been infested with rodents since augustâ€”a month before hurricane maria hit puerto rico . the federal agency awarded a $ 156 million contract to a small atlanta-based company called tribute contracting llc . it delivered only 50,000 of the 30 million meals promised , cnn reported . " one of the primary reasons fema failed to deliver these meals is because it inexplicably awarded a contract worth approximately $ <unk> million to deliver 30 million emergency meals to a tiny , one-person company with a history of struggling with much smaller contracts , " mercader says . " as if there was no need on the island . this is government negligence . " the office of the puerto rico federal affairs administration executive director carlos mercader explained past efforts to send the boxes of water , food and other supplies through other organizations . " every day , those employees would go into that office and saw those boxes and they did nothing , " hernandez mayoral , who ran the kissimmee headquarters from 2013 to 2014 , tells the ap . " we will soon conduct an inventory of the donations to identify which ones are fit to be given out to continue offering the services to the public . "
