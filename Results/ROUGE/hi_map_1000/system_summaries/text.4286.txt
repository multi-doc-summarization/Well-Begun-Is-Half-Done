norwegian air shuttle asa hopes to sell one-way tickets to europe for $ 69 as early as 2017 by flying from u.s. airports that have little to no international service , including new york 's westchester county airport and connecticut 's bradley international airport , just north of hartford . average prices on such routes are likely to be closer to $ 300 round trip , reports the ap . norwegian has 100 737 max jets from boeing co on order and expects to receive five in 2017 . these planes are equipped to traverse the atlantic but are smaller than most jets that currently make the journey , making them a better size for international flights to cities such as birmingham in britain , kjos said . regulators will have to agree to set up customs stations at us regional airports to handle international traffic , although kjos said he was confident this could be arranged . norwegian is not the only airline to market cheap fares across the atlantic . iceland 's wow air recently offered one-way fares between boston and paris for $ 99 . lufthansa 's low-cost subsidiary eurowings is also starting cheap long-haul flights . kjos downplayed the competitive threat of eurowings , saying " i do n't believe in their being able to operate low cost with a boeing 767 .
