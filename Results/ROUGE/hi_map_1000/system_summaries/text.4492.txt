global warming will cut antarctica 's 600,000-strong emperor penguin population by at least a fifth by 2100 as the sea ice on which the birds breed becomes less secure , a study said on sunday . the report urged governments to list the birds as endangered , even though populations in 45 known colonies were likely to rise slightly by 2050 before declining . " if sea ice declines at the rates projected by the ipcc climate models , and continues to influence emperor penguins as it did in the second half of the 20th century in terre ad√©lie , at least two-thirds of the colonies are projected to have declined by greater than 50 percent from their current size by 2100 , " said the study 's study . " it 's not happy news for the emperor penguin , " says the study , which notes that the study is the first to project the long-term outlook for antarctica 's largest penguins , which has distinctive golden head patches , would decline by more than half , it said . " long-term studies like this are invaluable for measuring the response of survival and breeding to changes in sea ice . "
