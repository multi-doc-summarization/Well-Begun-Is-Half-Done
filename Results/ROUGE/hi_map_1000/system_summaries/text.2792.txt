china warned the united states that it would damage relations , and american jobs , if it forces beijing to let its currency rise under a law to be voted on in the u.s. senate on tuesday , the ap reports . vice foreign minister cui tiankai on monday underlined beijing 's opposition to the bill , saying it could trigger a trade war and hold back global economic recovery . he said that relations could also be hurt by u.s. arms sales to taiwan . " if this type of situation occurs , of course it would be detrimental to the development of economic and trade relations between china and the u.s. and detrimental to u.s. economic and job growth , " cui said . " should the proposed legislation become law , the only result would be a situation where we 're just passing laws that are symbolic knowing that they 're probably not going to be upheld by the world trade organization , for example , and then suddenly u.s. companies are subject to a whole bunch of sanctions. . " the bill has been accused of undervaluing its currency , the renminbi , which has risen 30 percent against the dollar since 2005 .
