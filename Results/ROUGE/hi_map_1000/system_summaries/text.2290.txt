a federal agency announced plans thursday for a more intense investigation into what caused the deaths of 30 large whales in the western gulf of alaska and the southern shoreline of the alaska peninsula . teri rowles , noaa fisheries ' marine mammal health and stranding response coordinator , told reporters during a teleconference thursday that large-scale whale deaths are among the toughest to investigate , partly because the carcasses often are floating , rarely beached and difficult to access for examination . in alaska , bears feeding on washed-up whale carcasses create safety concerns for researchers who want to collect samples , she said . without being able to conduct a more complete necropsy , scientists and researchers can look at such things as environmental factors , historical information and mortality among seabirds or other sea creatures to try to get a better sense of what is going on , rowles said . " alaska has an awful lot of coastline and much of it is difficult to reach , " said noaa adviser dr. bree witteveen . " while we do not yet know the cause of these strandings , our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live . members of the public can greatly assist the investigation by immediately reporting any sightings of dead whales or distressed live animals they discover .
