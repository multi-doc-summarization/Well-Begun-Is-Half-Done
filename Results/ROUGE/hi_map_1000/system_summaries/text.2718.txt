afghanistan will accept a taliban liaison office in qatar to start peace talks but no foreign power can get involved in the process without its consent , the government 's peace council said . the head of the foreign relations department of the high peace council , mohammad ismail qasimyar , was killed by a suicide bomber posing as a peace emissary from the taliban . after rabbani 's death , karzai said peace efforts could only take place if the taliban established a political office that would be authorized to conduct talks on a peaceful end to the 10-year war . he proposed that it be set up in saudi arabia or in turkey if the insurgent forces would face the same fate as the soviet invaders who withdrew from afghanistan in 1989 after an almost decade-long war . officials said kabul was also deeply concerned about reports that the united states was considering the transfer of a small number of afghan prisoners from guantanamo bay military prison to doha as a prelude to the talks . " we are saying saudi or turkey are preferable , we are not saying it has to be there only . the only condition is it should be in an islamic country , " says a government official .
