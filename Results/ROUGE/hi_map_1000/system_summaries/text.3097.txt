" one of the areas of most rapid expansion has been eastern massachusetts , which has been a great surprise , " vitz said . " i think more and more people are seeing them . they are too big to escape . " the eagle was 38 years old and must have survived all sorts of close encounters . palmer â€™ s sighting , a hilltop nature reserve owned by the trustees of a dead deer , he also captured photos of it . advertisement in arlington and even the chestnut hill reservoir near boston college , where the athletic teams are known as the eagles . not every sighting has been confirmed , and it 's unclear whether it 's the same eagle or several , but there is no doubt there are more of them around , vitz . tom palmer has been jealous of people lucky enough to spot a bald eagle soaring through the sky or clutching the limb of your car . and so near ! when i first saw the eagle , he was soaring majestically a few hundred feet above the traffic that was moving north near quantico , va. then he came closer .
