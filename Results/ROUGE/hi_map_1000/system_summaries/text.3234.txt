auto sales are less than pleased with their new vehicles , according to a national customer satisfaction survey published tuesday . " while recall notices are a good thing , because they identify problems and offer solutions , the backlog in parts needed to fix the recalls is likely causing angst among the owners waiting to get their cars fixed , " says jack gillis chairman and founder in a statement . " we really become unhappy when we find any defect or are told we have to take our car in to have some kind of recall taken care of , even if it doesn ’ t cost us anything. . " the national highway traffic safety administration says the car brand owned by fiat chrysler and the lowest score since 2004 . " more defects point to quality issues , and customers perceive the quality is n't up to the standards that they had seen in past years , " he says . " but it ’ s a tough pill to swallow when you go to the dealer for the first time in eight or ten years and realize how much new cars . "
