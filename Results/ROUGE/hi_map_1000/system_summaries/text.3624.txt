netflix 's policy deserves to foster a “ freedom and responsibility ” culture that it ’ s now allowing employees to take off as much time as they want during the first year after their child 's birth or adoption . during that first year , netflix will “ keep paying them normally , ” eliminating the hassle of having to switch the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or finances . parents can return part-time , full-time , or return and then go back out as needed . this is a pretty landmark perk , with the company showing both current and potential employees how much it cares . the company suggests parents can come back to the office either part or full time , but it also means employees have to work with their managers and teams ahead of time to make sure their absence won ’ t jeopardize a project or deadline . we want employees to have the flexibility and confidence to balance the needs to make their own decisions along with the accompanying responsibility . with this in mind , today we ’ re introducing an unlimited leave policy for new moms and dads that allows them to be supported during the changes in their lives and return to work more focused and dedicated .
