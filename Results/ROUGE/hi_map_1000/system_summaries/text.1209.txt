a lion was shot dead in kenya on wednesday after attacking a man , while trackers in south africa searched for a lion whose escape from a park prompted appeals to wildlife officials to relocate it rather than kill it . the two cases of african lions on the loose highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions , whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century because of unregulated hunting , a loss of habitat and growing conflict with livestock herders . he was killed on wednesday morning by rangers after he strayed from nairobi national park . mohawk wildlife officials in kenya shot the escaped lion several times after it injured a person in the kajiado district , said paul udoto , a spokesman for the kenya wildlife service . " this action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety , " he said , per the ap . " we lost one of our best lions , " said nelly palmeris , a senior park warden at the national park on wednesday and ended up in isinya town , 12 miles away . veterinary teams headed to isinya after they got word on mohawk 's whereabouts . mohawk had been cornered , surrounded , taunted and stoned for about six hours before he lunged at a passing boda boda rider in isinya , kajiado county . the man was knocked down and clawed as the lion tried to flee his tormentors . local officials had tried to protect mohawk until kws arrived , but a crowd arrived and morans attacked him with arrows and spears . he broke through the crowd and attacked the boda boda in his way .
