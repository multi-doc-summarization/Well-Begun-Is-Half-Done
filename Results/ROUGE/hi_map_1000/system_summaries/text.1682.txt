a white chicago police officer charged with murder in the shooting of a black teenager has been hired to work as a janitor for the city 's police union as he awaits trial , the union president said thursday . dean angelo , president of the fraternal order of police , said he decided to hire van dyke after receiving a call from the chicago sun-times several weeks ago asking whether the officer was working for the union . at the time , angelo said that van dyke was working at the fop hall in the west loop because he couldn â€™ t find another job . the sun-times was captured on squad-car video and has prompted investigations , including a federal civil rights probe of the chicago police department . van dyke has been suspended from the department without pay . the union would do the same for any chicago officer and have hired dozens of people who are in no-pay status , angelo . " this officer is in a very difficult situation financially . he has a family and we would do it for anybody that works as a chicago police <unk> , " angelo said . " accuracy under these circumstances is paramount to truly grasping the significance to the decision made . "
