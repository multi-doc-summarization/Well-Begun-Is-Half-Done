conservative blogger andrew breitbart told the audience at a cpac rally that he possessed incriminating video tapes from president obama 's college years .

" the rest of us slept while they plotted , and they plotted . if not i apologize . @ cenlamar @ dust92 , " he said . " he seemed like a pretty engaging character , somehow larger than life . " " i thought he was perfectly respectful and i thought it was just really cool he was talking to a law student in dallas , " breitbart tweeted . " it 's so simple and effective , things like facts only serve to get in the way of the main message . but twitter , used by breitbart to in part to gleefully retweet comments against him , has now become the ultimate bastion of breitbart-obama conspiracy hashtagging , documented in this slideshow of the 11 most egregious and most laughable theories so far .
