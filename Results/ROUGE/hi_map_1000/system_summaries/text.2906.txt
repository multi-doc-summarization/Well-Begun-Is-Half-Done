the man convicted in the oldest cold case ever brought to court broke into a wide grin as a judge ordered him released from prison friday and granted him a new trial . jack mccullough , 76 , was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old maria ridulph . judge william brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found " clear and convincing evidence " that mccullough was wrongly found guilty . he was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back . mccullough 's lawyers and dekalb county state 's attorney richard schmack argued that mccullough 's conviction was based on false testimony , improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented , and a timeline that was tweaked to life in prison . schmack , who was n't clear until the last minute the brady would rule as he did . " rest assured i am not trying this case ... you will not hear the words , 'mr . mccullough is not guilty ' coming from my mouth . " mccullough 's ruling was prompted by a six-month report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart , point-by-point . mccullough has long insisted that he could n't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in rockford , illinois , talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the u.s. air force when she was taken . he repeated the alibi when he spoke with cnn in prison in march 2013 . " i am in here for murder . a murder i would not , could not have done . "
