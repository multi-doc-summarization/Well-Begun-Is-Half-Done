wikileaks founder julian assange says he will accept arrest by british police if a u.n. working group on arbitrary detention decides that the three years he has spent holed up in the ecuadorean embassy does not amount to illegal detention . writing on wikileaks ' twitter account wednesday night , assange said if the working group found in his favour , “ there is only one solution for marianne ny [ the swedish prosecutor seeking assange ’ s extradition ] , and that is to immediately release him and drop the case ” assange 's swedish lawyer , per samuelson , says the un panel 's decision would have " no formal impact " on its ongoing investigation . " if he is regarded as detained , that means he has served his case against the united kingdom and sweden then he will turn himself into police at noon on friday , " he said . " the un working group ’ s view differs from that of the swedish authorities . we will forward a reply to the working embassy tomorrow . it will be more clear tomorrow why we reject the working . " assange , 44 , claimed asylum in london 's ecuadorean embassy in 2012 . he wants to avoid extradition to sweden to face questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations , which he denies . the panel ’ s findings were disclosed to the swedish and british governments on 22 january , and will be published on friday morning . their judgment is not legally binding but can be used to apply pressure on states in human rights cases .
