" i began drafting an address to the nation about what would happen if congress refused to raise the debt limit within 48 hours , thus denying the united states as a safe and reliable place to invest , the cost of borrowing money would skyrocket down to their employees and their families . with each passing day , making our debt payments to businesses and governments around the world would become more and more difficult , " writes the washington post . " we have a weak economy , with falling government spending one main cause of that weakness . a shutdown would amount to a further economic hit , which could become a big deal if the shutdown went on for a long time .
