president trump pushed back thursday on concerns about a lack of nominees for key positions at the state department , among other agencies , including officials overseeing southeast asia and arms control . trump has fallen behind his four predecessors in the number of appointments confirmed by the senate by this time , while he also has fewer nominations sent compared to the four previous administrations , according to an appointee tracker from the washington post and partnership for public service . the president blamed senate democrats for more nominees not being approved , though he acknowledged that he has focused on nominating fewer people . " do n't forget , i 'm a business person and i tell my people 'well you do n't need to fill slots , do n't fill them , " trump said . " we have to get our people in . but in addition to that , we don ’ t need all of the people , you know , it ’ s called cost saving . ... there 's illegal , number one . and it 's really unfair to bernie sanders . i 'm not a bernie sanders fan . although i must say that i got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out . many of those people voted for me because of trade , because i agreed with him on trade . we 're just doing more about it than he can do and we 're doing a lot about it . but i thought that was terrible .
