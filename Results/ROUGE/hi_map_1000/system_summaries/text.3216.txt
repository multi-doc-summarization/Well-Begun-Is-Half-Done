rick santorum 's republican establishment on his radio show wednesday for being " shocked " by rick santorum , who is not running to be " pastor in chief " and that clergy should be working harder . " it 's not because i want to be the pastor of the united states , " he said . " to look at the reaction they ’ re having today , to see how shocked they are that rick santorum has come out of what they thought was an impossible position equivalent to nowhere , is an incredible thing. . " limbaugh , 53 , greeted the republican party that it would be making a serious mistake to assume that voters that opt for a non-mitt romney candidate do so simply under limbaugh ’ s orders . " they ’ ve been saying the past couple of weeks , if you ’ re looking for a conservative who is the least corrupted , who has the least number of periods of wandering off the reservation , but i 'm leaving that to you , all right ? but that does n't mean i 'm not going to stand and fight for the things that are consistent with what this country was founded upon , which was a moral foundation , " santorum tells abc news . " i think you may have seen a little bit of that last night . "
