the european space agency still do n't know exactly where the lander is on the comet and are anxiously hoping its batteries hold out long enough for them to get the mining data and adjust the spacecraft 's position . it was a race against time friday for the philae lander , which on wednesday became the first spacecraft to touch down on a comet . since then it has sent astonishing images from the icy , dusty comet , 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko , and generated some data from instruments such as one that measures temperatures . " my rotation was successful ( 35 degrees ) . looks like a whole new comet from this angle , " read a message posted on the lander ’ s official twitter account . " first comet drilling is a fact ! " says the lander , who has been relaying by esa 's rosetta satellite to the surface of comet 67p , which has been preparing to “ hop ” the robotic probe in a hope it would settle in a sunnier spot on the tool ’ s surface . later came a promising announcement . commands were uploaded on friday night to fire them , scientists said , warning there was no guarantee of success . another strategy under discussion was to spin up an internal flywheel that could make philae cartwheel out of its predicament and keep systems up and running .
