scientists have found that the planet 's phoebe ring is more than twice the thickness once thought it can ’ t be seen with the human eye . the study , published in the university of maryland , college park douglas hamilton , a planetary scientist at the journal nature . " it is 10 to 20 times larger than the second-biggest ring , so this thing is absolutely gargantuan. , " he said . " that does a really good job of explaining rings—except for this one . " the ring is not only bigger than the researchers thought , it appears to be made of unusually fine particles—particles that continually collide with saturn 's moon iapetus as it circles the planet , turning the moon ’ s leading face black . hamilton was part of the team that discovered the phoebe ring in 2009 , with help from the spitzer space telescope . they estimated at the time that the ring was likely over two hundred times the radius of its host planet . " i was giving talks saying saturn has a giant invisible ring , which makes you sound just perfectly crazy , " says lead author douglas hamilton .
