paul mccartney and sony/atv have reached a settlement over the ownership of songs he wrote with the beatles , the hollywood reporter reports . mccartney filed a lawsuit against sony/atv music publishing , seeking a court â€™ s declaration that he can reclaim outright many of his the beatles compositions from the 1960s and 70s . in his lawsuit , filed in a new york federal court , mccartney cites the beatles songs that he and john lennon jointly created from 1962 to 1971 , noting that during that time they typically assigned their copyright interests to publishers in exchange for royalties . a provision of the copyright act allows authors and co-authors to reclaim the copyrights in their works after a set period of time , provided that they serve termination notices on the current rights holder . in 1976 , congress increased the period that works are under copyright protection , and , in recognition of authors who had signed over their rights to publishers and studios without much bargaining power , allowed such authors 35 years hence to reclaim rights in the latter stages of a copyright term . " the parties have resolved this matter by entering into a confidential settlement agreement and jointly request that the court enter the enclosed hits in the very near future whether the label likes it or not . sony currently holds the copyright on the songs , but in legal docs sir paul says they will become his property again in 2018 .
