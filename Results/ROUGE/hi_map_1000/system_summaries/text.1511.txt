heavy metal band motörhead has died at the age of 70 , the band announced via its official facebook page monday night . " we will say more in the coming days , but for now , please ... play motörhead loud , play hawkwind 's music loud . have a drink or few , " he said . " he will be sadly missed . he was a warrior and a legend . i will see you on the other side . " kilmister was known as lemmy , found out he was sitting in front of his favourite video game . " i was put on a plane to toronto , " lemmy tells q magazine . he 's not clear whether his body would collapse without it , but he did n't stop taking speed because it is as much a collection of myths and legends as a man . in the popular imagination , he spent time as a roadie for jimi hendrix before his first taste of stardom with british space rockers hawkwind , singing the band 's biggest hit , biker anthem silver machine , in 1972 . he would soon form motörhead , the name of a song about speed freaks he had written for hawkwind . lemmy is shown with slash , performing at the 2nd annual golden gods awards in los angeles in april 2010 .
