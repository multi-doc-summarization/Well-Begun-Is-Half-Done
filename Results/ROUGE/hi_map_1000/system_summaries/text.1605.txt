groupon 's ipo last night at $ 20 a share and started trading this morning around $ 30 , the los angeles times reports . groupon 's stock soared about 40 % from its $ 20-a-share ipo price . groupon shares in morning trading bumped around , trading as a public company last night with a market value of $ 12.7 billion — more than xerox , research in motion or the gap . right now , groupon ’ s market value is $ 16.5 billion . yes , that ’ s a good thing . it is cutting back on marketing costs , which is bringing growth to a screeching halt . groupon is already being valued at a fifth of amazon 's value , but it has already picked the low-hanging fruit in its key markets . it 's not a great sign ( even though it happens all the time ) . " and how could they ? we have no idea what groupon 's cash flow will be this quarter , let alone two years from now , all of which count in the " present value " calculation . " we also do n't know what the company has discovered a huge new market , and its scale gives it a big barrier to entry . but that does n't mean the ride will be smooth . could groupon , say , double from here over the next 6 months and never trade below this level again ? sure , it could . anything 's possible .
