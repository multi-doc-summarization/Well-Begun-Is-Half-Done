two young tibetan monks set themselves on fire to protest against government religious controls in western china on monday , the ap reports . china 's foreign ministry said any reincarnation chosen by the dalai lama would be " illegal " after the tibetan spiritual leader announced that he , and not beijing , would decide whether he should be reincarnated , in consultation with other monks , and that china should have no say in the matter . under tibetan tradition , monks identify a young boy who shows signs he is a reincarnation of a late leader , but many predict china will simply appoint its own successor to the dalai . the dalai monks made the statement in a 4,200-word document issued after a gathering of leaders of the four schools of tibetan buddhism in the northern indian hill town of dharamshala , home of the government kirti monastery in the indian town of dharamsala , where tibet 's government-in-exile is based , said he got his information from at least 10 different people inside the monastery and within aba , including eyewitness accounts of the self-immolations . tsering said the two monks suffered slight burns and were in stable condition , state news agency xinhua said , citing doctors .
