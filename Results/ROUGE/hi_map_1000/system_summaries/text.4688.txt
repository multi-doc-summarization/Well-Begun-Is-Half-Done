israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has backtracked on controversial comments he made last week during which he was a palestinian cleric who gave hitler the idea of annihilating europe 's jews during world war ii . " the decision to move from a policy of deporting jews to the final solution was made by the nazis and was not dependent on outside influence , " netanyahu said . " in no way did i intend to absolve hitler of his responsibility for the holocaust . hitler and the nazi leadership are responsible for the murder of six million jews . " netanyahu posted on facebook , in hebrew and english . " i wish to clarify my remarks about the connection between the mufti haj amin of the nazis that led to the break with civilization that was the holocaust , " he said , per the new york times . " this is taught in german schools for good reason , it must never be forgotten . and i see no reason to change our view of history in any way . we know that responsibility for this crime against humanity is german and very hitler . "
