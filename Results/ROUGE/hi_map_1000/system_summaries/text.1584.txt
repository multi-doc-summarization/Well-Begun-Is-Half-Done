a key hawaii lawmaker considering an anti-prostitution bill says he and honolulu police have agreed to get rid of a longtime exemption that allowed officers to have sex with prostitutes . state sen. clayton hee , head of the senate judiciary committee , said he and police agreed at a meeting tuesday that the exemption ran contrary to popular opinion . honolulu police said during the meeting that moves through his committee friday will remove sexual penetration from the police exemption from prostitution laws , leaving police with the ability to solicit sex in the course of an investigation . " i suppose that in retrospect the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation , " hee said . " but , thankfully , the issue has been brought to light and the behavior has been addressed . " the police support the idea that sexual penetration shall not be an exempt permitted behavior by the police in making arrests on prostitutes . " that 's exactly what we wanted and how we 've been conducting our investigations , with the verbal offer , " bell says . " they agree this tool is not an appropriate tool for their toolbox . "
