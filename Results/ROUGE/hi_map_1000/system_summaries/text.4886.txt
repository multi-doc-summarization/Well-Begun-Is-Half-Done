robert mueller 's investigation is " all just a big pr campaign , " samantha bee tells a local cbs-affiliate . " rudy is like a james bond villain who explains his evil plot to 007 before he actually catches him , " he said . " i know there ’ s got ta be channels other than if you don ’ t cut your grass , i ’ m arresting you , ” conner says . " but trump 's not keeping rudy around for his brilliant legal mind , he 's keeping him around to spread brilliant propaganda , " bee said , per the new york times . " no matter how many times trump says it , there is no 'spygate , ' " she says , per rudy giuliani , who notes that she was not even issued a ticket prior to a letter to appear in court for her failing to mow the city 's instructions because they are spending so much money paying off their fines . vincent has also spent time in pagedale jail as a result of his fines and fees ; it belongs to his long-time partner , valarie whitner , who is also a plaintiff in this case . valarie was even arrested in front of her home and taken to pagedale city hall because of an unspecified ticket . conner is not alone in being arrested for not having the ability to pay a fine , those who can not pay often do not come to court . they , like those who choose their jobs or child care over attending municipal court , then become the subject of arrest warrants and fines for failure to appear .
