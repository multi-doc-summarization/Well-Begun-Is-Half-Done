some progressive organizations have been making a push in recent days for incoming congressional republicans to drop their government-sponsored health care on the grounds that keeping the plans would be hypocritical . " these republicans want to repeal health reform , putting the insurance companies back in charge and putting affordable coverage out of reach of millions of americans , " afscme president gerald mcentee said in a statement . " if they enroll in the taxpayer-funded health care system provided to members of congress , they deserve to be denounced as hypocrites . " there is an apparent double standard with respect to lawmakers trying to reduce health care for american workers while taking a pay cut of about five percent . so opting are looking for ways to say that they feel solidarity with the american people this might be one way to do it , " said michael steel , spokesman for presumptive house speaker john boehner ( r-penn ) and bobby schilling ( r-ill. ) both said they would , in fact , forgo the coverage . it escalated even further when white house press secretary robert gibbs called out harris for the " irony , " and the municipal workers union afscme applied a similar charge to the whole gop shortly thereafter .
