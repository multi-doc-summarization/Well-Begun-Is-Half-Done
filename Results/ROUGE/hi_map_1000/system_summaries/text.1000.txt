the mexican attorney representing " affluenza " teen ethan couch in his unfolding immigration fight says a decision on the 18-year-old 's deportation could be " months away , " with even further appeals after that . " he said that as a judge is currently considering couch 's detention and possible deportation , " he says . " why would mexico go along with this idea of locating someone and summarily kicking them out of the country so the marshals can grab him across the border ? i do n't think that 's okay . " couch , who was 16 at the time of the crash and was tried in juvenile court , received 10 years ' probation for driving drunk and crashing into a disabled suv parked on the side of the road in 2013 . the mother and son were arrested monday after using a phone to order pizza delivery that was traced to a condominium complex in the mexican resort city of puerto vallarta . couch won a delay in his deportation based on a constitutional appeal in mexico that could lead to a trial process lasting weeks or even months . any flaw in the process of his detention by mexican immigration authorities can be considered a violation of due process and of his human rights , legal analysts say . fernando benitez , a high-profile attorney based primarily out of tijuana , confirmed on friday that he 's filing a petition essentially saying that couch 's constitutional and civil rights may have been violated . he says the teen 's crimes here in the united states should have no bearing on mexican officials , or mexican courts .
