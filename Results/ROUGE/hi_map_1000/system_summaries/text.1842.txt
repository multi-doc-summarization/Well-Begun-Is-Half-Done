a petition calling for donald trump to be banned from entering the uk has attracted more than a quarter of a million signatures , the ap reports . the petition , raised in response to a recent series of distasteful , divisive comments made by donald trump as part of his us presidential campaign , reads : " the petition will allow all uk residents who want to stand up against hate speech and donald trump 's hate speech specifically the opportunity to do so . trump persists with comments which i feel denigrating races , nationalities , women , religious groups . i would term this hate speech , and to my mind he becomes more outlandish and unacceptable as each day passes . i am not alone in feeling this way by the same principles should apply to donald j trump . we can not see how the united kingdom can condone his entry to the country when many people have been barred from uk entry . " the uk 's comments about muslims have caused a great deal of controversy and the white house has distanced itself from him as a presidential candidate . now a petition is asking theresa may to ban the would-be politician from setting foot on british soil .
