jonah hill 's star may have been on the rise as he hit saturday night live for the third time as host last night , but his attempts to step out of wolf of wall street co-star leonardo dicaprio 's shadow went a bit awry during the opening monologue . after a series of dicaprio-focused questions from the host , dicaprio himself appeared onstage to rein in hill 's fragile ego and admonish him for trying to act like a big shot . to sooth his nerves , hill asked dicaprio to do what the pair did every day on the idea of falling in love with a completely artificial computer personality . who could blame you ? that 's pretty weird . maybe instead , the future will be a place where you can learn to love yourself . wait , actually scratch that ; that 's super weird too . jonah hill and michael cera illustrate that hypothetical horror just perfectly . having said that , this installment was hilarious . all of the jokes worked and strong and bayer have a rapport with each other now that ’ s really , really great . if the attitude is , “ we ’ re going to keep doing this sketch until we get it right .
