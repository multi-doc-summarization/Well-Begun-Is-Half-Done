rick santorum was already known as starting from a deficit , delegate-wise , in ohio . he failed to qualify for any district delegates in three ohio congressional districts because he did n't turn in delegate names there . in three of the state 's 16 congressional districts , including two that are near ohio 's border with pennsylvania , santorum will lose any delegates he might have won because his campaign failed to meet a petition with the state party to claim them . " on super tuesday , if sen. santorum were to carry a district where he has not seated a full delegate slate , he is eligible to be awarded only the number of delegates he submitted , assuming he wins a particular district . chris maloney , a spokesman for the ohio republican party tonight , the former pennsylvania u.s. senator filed incomplete delegate slates in six additional ohio districts . altogether , this means santorum , who until this week had a fair lead in polls in the republican nominating race , could be ineligible for 18 ohio district delegates . ohio has 66 delegates total , 63 at stake next tuesday .
