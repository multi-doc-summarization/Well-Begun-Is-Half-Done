" for applications inside the body , we need a small , controllable , untethered robot system , " says rus . " it â€™ s really difficult to control and place a robot inside the <unk> if the robot is attached to a tether . " the robot has a magnet attached , and its movements are controlled using magnetic fields that are applied externally , but the new york times notes that the new robot is a successor to one reported at the university of york , in england ; steven guitron , a graduate student in mechanical engineering ; shuguang li , a csail postdoc ; kazuhiro yoshida of tokyo institute of technology , who was visiting mit on sabbatical when the work was done and is now a lecturer in electronics at the same conference last year , the design of its body is significantly different .
