president bush 's campaign manager in 2004 and a former chairman of the republican national committee , gay , is gay . he 's gay posted at 6:37 pm on august 25 , 2010 by allahpundit he says he was gay . " he is , after all , the most powerful republican ever to identify himself as gay . but my sense is that it ’ ll be a lot less of a big deal to conservatives than it might be to liberals like ( just to choose one name at random ) frank rich , for whom the political is also the personal . while it ’ s something that runs counter to the stereotype , most of the conservatives i know are largely to completely indifferent to a person ’ s sexual orientation . they are the kind of people who might even invite elton john to perform at their weddings and not give a second thought to the fact that john is gay , " he writes . " it 's pretty hard to imagine that the guy who ran the gop during its recent campaigns against gay marriage would come out as homosexual unless he felt he had no choice . "
