the chemical chain of all living things has been generated by scientists who say that the likeness sheds considerable light on the mystery of how life first emerged on earth . this venerable ancestor was a single-cell , bacterium-like organism . but it has a grand name , or at least an acronym . it is known as luca , the last universal common ancestor , and is estimated to have lived some four billion years ago , when earth was a mere 560 million years old . the new finding sharpens the debate between those who believe life began in some extreme environment , such as in deep sea vents or the flanks of volcanoes , and others who favor more normal settings , and thus could be tracked from an ancestral species through all of its descendants . that made the 355 gene families likely luca candidates . as martin and his colleagues report in today ’ s issue of nature microbiology , these genes aren ’ t randomly scattered throughout modern organisms , but also swap them among their neighbors in a process called horizontal gene transfer . this makes it hard to tell whether genes shared by separate microbes reflect a shared lineage or whether some bugs were just better at spreading their genetic material far and wide . and that makes it harder to pin down luca ’ s lifestyle . to get closer to doing just that , researchers led by william martin , an evolutionary biologist at heinrich heine university in dusseldorf , germany , took a more stringent approach to identifying genes that were likely inherited .
