new scientific tests have turned up no evidence of modern forgery in a text written on ancient egyptian papyrus that refers to jesus as being married , according to a long-awaited article to be published thursday in the harvard theological review . the findings support the argument of harvard professor karen l. king that the controversial text , the first-known explicit reference to a married jesus , is almost certainly an authentic document . the “ gospel of jesus ’ s wife ” was introduced to the world by king at a conference in rome 18 months ago . the announcement made headlines around the world , and many of king ’ s chemical composition consistent with carbon-based inks used by ancient egyptians . one scholar found that the fragment is evidence that jesus was actually married . it would have been composed much later than the gospels of the new testament , which are regarded as the earliest and most reliable sources on the historical jesus and which are silent on that question . advertisement said , hypothetically , that a highly skilled modern forger could have obtained the right kind of ink and meticulously applied it to a blank piece of ancient papyrus . determining the age of the ink using conventional testing methods would destroy the tiny document , roughly the size of a business card .
