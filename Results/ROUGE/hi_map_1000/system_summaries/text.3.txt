the siskiyou county board of supervisors voted 4-1 on tuesday to support the county 's split from the state of california . it 's the first in a long series of steps to form the proposed state of jefferson , which proponents of the effort say would bring representation to rural north state counties that currently are beholden to the whims of representatives of the more heavily populated southern california and free them from burdensome state regulations . " we have to have government that 's local , understands our issues and has empathy , " said mark baird , a rancher who the searchlight said . " there has been a total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee . those things may not be important to the rest of the state , but it 's important . " she says she and other lamalfa staff members supported the effort to secede , but she did n't want to raise her child in california . " i have n't had one contact in regard to this issue , that 's in opposition , " he says . " many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our god-given rights . "
