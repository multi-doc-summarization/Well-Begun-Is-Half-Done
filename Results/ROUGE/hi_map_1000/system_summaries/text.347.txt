kelsey grammer 6 before he was out of his teens , grammer had experienced more loss than most people do in a lifetime . growing up , he lived with his mother and grandfather , who he lost at age 11 . two years later , his dad was shot and set on fire . the killer was found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a psychiatric hospital instead of prison . when he was just the third worst thing he did that year . after being acquitted for a murder he probably committed thanks to a bush league prosecutor , charles was hired to kill another person so the victim 's business partner could collect insurance money . amazingly , he got off again , this time on a mistrial , because texas ' judicial system in the '60s was apparently the equivalent of a first-turn guess in a game of clue . prison straightened charles out , and he dedicated the rest of his life to his family . this is another way of saying that he got out of prison after serving only five years of his sentence and immediately murdered a judge .
