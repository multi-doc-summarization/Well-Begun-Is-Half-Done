eliot spitzer was hit with two libel lawsuits seeking $ 90 million by former marsh & mclennan cos executives over a column posted on slate.com about an insurance bid-rigging scandal . the lawsuits arose from spitzer 's august 22 , 2010 , column , " they still do n't get it , " advocating prosecution of corporate wrongdoers and defending his own enforcement activity against marsh and insurer american international group inc. william gilman , a former marsh global placement director , contended that they were defamed by the column , which appeared thee months after a judge threw out their convictions on felony antitrust charges . neither is named in the column . slate.com is owned by washington post co , and its parent slate llc is a defendant in both cases . gilman had worked at marsh for 28 years when spitzer , then new york 's attorney general , in 2004 opened a probe into the company 's practices -- including alleged kickbacks seeking $ 30 million with the new york state supreme court in manhattan . both cases were filed on friday and made public on monday . spitzer , in a phone interview , will hear the case based on these facts , brought by the state when i was attorney general . at stake is much more than the particular cases at issue . by trying to rewrite the narrative of the economic cataclysm we have lived through , the deniers are attempting to challenge the common-sense conclusions that flow from an accurate understanding of history . they are desperately trying to protect a particularly rabid , and ultimately damaging , anti-regulatory philosophy that has dominated the past 30 years .
