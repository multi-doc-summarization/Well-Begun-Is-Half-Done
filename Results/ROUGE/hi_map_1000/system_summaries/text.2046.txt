iran 's supreme leader on wednesday urged europe to do more to back the 2015 nuclear deal after president donald trump refused to re-certify the pact . european companies have rushed into the iranian markets since the landmark accord , which lifted international sanctions in exchange for restrictions on iran 's nuclear program . " the european governments have underlined the nuclear deal 's issue and condemned the u.s. president 's remarks , " ayatollah ali khamenei said , per the ap . " we welcome this approach but it is not enough that they only tell him not to tear up the deal . " he said of trump : " i don â€™ t want to waste our time to respond to the rants and whoppers of the foul-throated president of the united states , " he says . " i am announcing today that we can not and will not make this certification . we will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence , though trump in the announcement did not call on lawmakers to do so . the supreme leader also called on allies in tehran that the us was angry because iran had foiled its plots in lebanon , syria , iraq and egypt .
