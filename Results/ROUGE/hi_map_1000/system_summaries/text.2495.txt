a man had spotted the european bison next to the river oder near the town of lebus on wednesday and alerted the authorities , according to police . the head of the local public order office decided that the bison needed to be killed in order to protect the population and instructed two local hunters to kill the beast on thursday , the ap reports . " after more than 250 years a wild bison had been spotted again in germany and all the authorities could think to do is shoot it. , " chris heinrich 's wwf minister jörg tells der tagesspiegel . " i thought i was retracing my footsteps to a road , but it suddenly dawns on me that this stretch of trees , underbrush and wild flowers doesn ’ t look at all familiar . with a sudden surge of wind stirs the branches and a few leaves drift slowly down to earth . a magpie lets out a hand back through the trees , finally arriving at a wider path after ten minutes . this seems more hopeful and soon the distant sound of a fast-moving car tells me the road must be somewhere near . speeding up in anticipation , i don ’ t notice the three men until i have almost bumped into them . silently they emerge from a copse of birch trees and one of them raises a hand for me to stop .
