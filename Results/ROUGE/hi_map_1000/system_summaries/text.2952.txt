a federal judge is set to hear testimony on whether louisiana prison officials are adequately protecting death-row inmates from dangerous heat and humidity inside louisiana state penitentiary at angola . instead , the corrections department and attorney general 's office have accrued at least $ 1,067,000 in expenses fighting the 3-year-old lawsuit filed on behalf of three inmates with medical problems , the ap reports . the inmates ' attorneys disagree and are urging jackson to reconsider air conditioning on death row 's six tiers , which house dozens of inmates . in 2014 , an engineer hired by the state said nine air-conditioning units could adequately cool all eight tiers in the 10-year-old building that houses death row . " it would be a large burden on the prisons to have to set forth the costs to implement these measures , " grant guillot , an attorney for the state , said during an appeals court hearing last year . " the state itself indicated that they could install mechanical air , fix this problem , end this case , for about -- what was it ? about a million dollars , " jackson said . louisiana 's attorneys argue that the consequences would reverberate far beyond angola 's prison walls , spawning more lawsuits from prisoners across the country demanding air-conditioned cells .
