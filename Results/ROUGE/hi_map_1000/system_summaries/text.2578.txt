mitt romney , who has backed gun control measures in the past , said on monday that additional laws would not have stopped last week 's massacre in a colorado movie theater . " i still believe that the second amendment is the right course to preserve and defend and do n't believe that new laws are going to make a difference in this type of tragedy , " romney told cnbc , per cnbc . " where there are opportunities for people of reasonable minds to come together and find common ground , that 's the kind of legislation i like . the idea of one party jamming through something over the objection of the other tends to divide the nation , not make us a more safe and prosperous place . so if there 's common ground . we 're talking about our respective views and at the same time , our hearts are heavy as we think about the funerals that 'll be held this week and the families that have been so tragically altered by virtue of the loss of life , " he said . " obviously , the campaigns are not the laws , our challenge is people who , obviously , are distracted from reality and do unthinkable , unimaginable , inexplicable things . "
