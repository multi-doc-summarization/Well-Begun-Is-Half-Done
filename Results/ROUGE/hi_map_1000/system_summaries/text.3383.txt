the first court hearing for six baltimore police officers who are charged in the death of freddie gray , a black man who died a week after suffering a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody on april 12 , the ap reports . the decision came at a pretrial hearing wednesday , shortly after williams had denied a defense motion seeking to have the charges dropped . williams said that while he was " troubled " by some of the comments mosby made during a may 1 news conference , they did not compromise the defendants ' right to a fair trial . williams also said the assertion that mosby 's judgment was impacted by the fact that her husband , nick mosby , is a councilman in a district that experienced a disproportionate amount of violence during the riots that gray 's death sparked is " condescending . " police , who had been criticized for their response to previous demonstrations and rioting , repeatedly ordered protesters to " remain on the sidewalk " and quickly responded to one tense moment near the inner harbor in which a protester was arrested and an officer suffered minor injuries .
