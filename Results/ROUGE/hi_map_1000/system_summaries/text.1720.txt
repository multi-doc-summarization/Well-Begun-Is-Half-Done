the worst mass extinction in history has been blamed for the sudden loss of 90 % of marine species and 70 percent of land vertebrates , the ap reports . the event was so severe it has been called the great dying . the end-permian extinction took place , killing 97 million years ago , is the most severe of five known mass extinction events . it killed off the last of the trilobitesâ€”a hardy marine species that survived two previous mass extinctions . while land plants survived , almost all forests disappeared . worst of all , it is the only known extinction event where even insects were n't spared . for an event of this size to take place , a lot of things would have to go wrong . at the time the world was made up of a single supercontinent called pangea . this large landmass , by altering the dynamics of how carbon is cycled with subducting plates , may have pushed global temperatures to the highest they had ever been . over the course of about a million years , huge eruptions in siberia spewed basalts that cover an area that was about seven times the size of france . first , a genetic change allowed it to become a microscopic methane-producing life form called methanosarcina that lack a nucleus and other usual cell structures . " a rapid initial injection of carbon dioxide from a volcano would be followed by a gradual decrease , " said us scientist dr greg fournier , one of the researchers . " many , if not most , of the surviving groups of organisms barely hung on , with only a few species making it through , many probably by chance . "
