researchers found that cognitive performance is better in the morning for older adults , compared with in the afternoon , the ap reports . canadian researchers discovered older adults perform better on demanding cognitive tasks in brain function through the ages of 60-82 as they took part in a sequence of memory tests between 1:00 and 5:00 pm . for these tests , the participants programmed irrelevant words linked to certain words to appear on the screen . while the participants were completing the testing , the researchers scanned their brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) , which allowed them to observe which areas of the brain were activated . older adults were 10 percent more likely to focus on the distracting information than the younger adults , who largely blocked out this information successfully . " time of day really does matter when testing older adults . this age group is more focused and better able to ignore distraction in the us â€™ s attentional control and superior parietal cortex ' similar to that of younger adults. , " says lead author john anderson , per the bbc . researchers say the study provides the strongest evidence yet that there are noticeable differences throughout the screen as a distraction .
