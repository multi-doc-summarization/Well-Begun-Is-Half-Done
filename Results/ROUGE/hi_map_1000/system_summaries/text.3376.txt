rick scott and top state lawmakers proposed on friday and rejected calls to arm teachers with guns to prevent school massacres . " i want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who is a danger to themselves or others to use a gun , " he said . " my focus is on bringing in law enforcement . i think you need to have individuals who are trained , well trained . " scott also defied the national rifle association by unveiling a sweeping plan to keep students safe in his state , including suggestions to raise the minimum age to buy any firearm , keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill and ban the sale of bump stocks . a former student fatally shot 17 people at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland on february 14 , sparking renewed and heated debate over the age of 21 from buying or owning guns , and outlaw so-called bump stocks that make it possible for semi-automatic weapons to fire faster . " we must take care of our kids , " said scott , a republican , per a news conference announcing his three-part plan .
