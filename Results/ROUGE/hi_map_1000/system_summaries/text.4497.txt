president trump 's abrupt firing of fbi director james comey has threatened to slow or even stall republicans ' policy agenda on capitol hill . already facing democratic opposition on some of their top priorities , republicans insist the matter wo n't derail them but it 's already proven to be a distraction at the very least . as the week began , senate republicans were focused on health care after the house narrowly passed its version of legislation to overhaul obamacare . a host of democrats have said that they won ’ t consider a new replacement to lead the fbi until a special counsel has been appointed to oversee that investigation , which comey was leading . " frankly we should hold off on the fbi director until we get this special prosecutor , " said sen. mark warner , d-virginia , the top democrat on the intelligence committee , indicating that he would try to slow down or block the confirmation of any fbi director . " the democrats were already opposing everything all the time . unless you are spinal tap you can ’ t really turn the opposition volume from 10 to 11 , " he said . " i don ’ t think it makes any difference for health care . "
