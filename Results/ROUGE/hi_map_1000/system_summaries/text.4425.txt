gq magazine placed the bible on a list called " 21 books you don ’ t have to read. " veuer magazine , a bible of “ grooming , repetitive and contradictory ” and style advice , has sparked a social media conflagration by calling the good book is not so good . " the holy bible is rated very highly by all the people who supposedly live by it but who in actuality , and misogynistic gender roles , is a major factor in the degradation of america . rather than perpetuate this myth , i 'd suggest olivia , the story of a british teenage girl who is sent to a boarding school in france . it is short and written in a kind of levelheaded and deceptively straightforward style . olivia never takes a wrong step , but there are signs for those who know how to read them . i read it because everyone else in school was reading it but thought it was totally silly . now , looking back , i find that it is without any literary merit whatsoever . why waste adolescents ' time ? some are racist and some are sexist , but most are just really , really boring . so we—and a group of un-boring writers—give you permission to strike these books from the canon . here 's what you should read instead .
