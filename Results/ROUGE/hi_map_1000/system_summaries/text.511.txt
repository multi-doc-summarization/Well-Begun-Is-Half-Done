" the washington post notes that the posts were reportedly written in october but came under the spotlight after a washington examiner article on tuesday . screenshots of them have since circulated social media , as critics call for her to be fired . she wrote by the examiner , " i am expected to take a hatch for both sides . but this world has changed and i have changed . and i would n't take a criminal law that prevents agents like her from airing their political beliefs publicly .
