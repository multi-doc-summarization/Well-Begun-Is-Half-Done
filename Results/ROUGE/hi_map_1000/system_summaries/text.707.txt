arizona 's ban on abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy is poised to take effect this week as scheduled after a federal judge ruled monday that the statute may prompt a few pregnant women who are considering abortion to make the decision earlier . but he said the law is constitutional because it does n't prohibit any women from making the decision to end their pregnancies . the judge also wrote that the state provided " substantial and well-documented " evidence that an unborn child has the capacity to feel pain during an abortion by at least 20 weeks . " this law may have intended to do good , but it can really adversely affect non-profit organizations that desperately want to help people but maybe ca n't help the number of people who now come to us , " said nancy northup , the center 's president and ceo . " we are already stretched very , very thin . i do n't know where this money would come . " the new york-based center for reproductive rights and another group filed a notice wednesday on a request from abortion-rights groups that he temporarily block the law 's enforcement . the groups ' lawyer said during the hearing that the ban crosses a clear line on what u.s. supreme court rulings permit , and it intrudes on women 's health decisions at a key point in pregnancy . montgomery argued the state legislature was justified in enacting the ban to protect the health of women and to shield fetuses from pain .
