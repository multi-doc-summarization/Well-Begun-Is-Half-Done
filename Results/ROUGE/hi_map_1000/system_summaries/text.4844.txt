the number of babies born with syphilis has more than doubled since 2013 , a 46 % increase on the previous year number of hiv in 2017 , the cdc reported tuesday . the greatest number of cases were in the south and west . syphilis last year included 64 babies who were stillborn , and 13 who died as infants . it is easily preventable : women who test positive for syphilis while pregnant can be treated and cured with penicillin , and won â€™ t pass the disease on to their babies . but some women never get tested , while others test negative but then contract the disease during their pregnancy . " when passed to a baby , syphilis can result in miscarriage , newborn death and severe lifelong physical and mental health problems , " he said . " no parent should have to bear the death of a child when it would have been prevented with a simple test and safe treatment . " the cdc , meanwhile , says louisiana women should be tested for syphilis as early as possible and later in their pregnancies . " it 's just a systemic public health failure , " david harvey , the executive director of the national coalition of std directors , tells the guardian . " we are failing pregnant women in the united states . "
