a human rights group says the camp for human rights in north korea , grew 72 percent between 2009 and 2010 alone , the report says . between 2003 and 2013 , the camp expanded to include several new buildings , agricultural fields and almost two dozen guards , the committee says . " it appears that north korea 's vast system of unlawful imprisonment may be undergoing an alteration involving the consolidation of some of its political prison camps , and the expansion of others , " greg scarlatoiu , executive director of the committee , said in an interview with the post . " i hope that the united states , through pressure and persuasion , can convince kim not to murder all those people in the camps . " the camp is estimated to house about 5,000 prisoners . " between 2009 , " he said , " it is just a matter of time before kim jong il thinks of this , " shin said in a press release . the camp was built from all 865 square meters to about 1,000 square meters , a 72 percent increase , and political opponents could also be behind the expansion . in either case , it ’ s impossible to do more than guess at the reasons for camp 25 ’ s shifting borders . the gulags remain one of the most shadowy corners of the already secretive north korea -- they only recently showed up on maps . and because most inmates are imprisoned for life , even to the second or third generation , few people have managed to share stories from inside the camp .
