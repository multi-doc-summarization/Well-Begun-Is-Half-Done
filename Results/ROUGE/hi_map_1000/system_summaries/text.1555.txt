" if we hadn ’ t intervened , i have no doubt it would have died , the elastic would have kept cutting deeper and deeper into the neck , " jones told 7news sydney . " when you ’ re dealing with a wild animal like this anything can happen . their teeth are always on display and they are very <unk> . " the shark swam away , and though the wound looks pretty bad , officials say it should heal in a month or so . only an estimated 1,500 of the grey nurse sharks remain off the australian coast , so saving one is certainly a commendable act . similar stories on grindtv rare image shows great white shark losing tooth during airborne attack on seal whale shark about to eat diver , or so it appears scientists off delaware catch shark within a shark follow grindtv on google+ .
