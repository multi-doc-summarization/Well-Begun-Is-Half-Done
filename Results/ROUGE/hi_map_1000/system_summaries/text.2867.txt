the bottle of the bottle when you pour it has become as accepted an inevitability as death and taxes , reports the new york times . wine accessory companies sell products specifically built to address this problem , but it 's not perfect , but they ’ re so simple and have gone without significant improvement or changes for so long that there ’ s little chance they ’ ll ever evolve , right ? not so fast . an extremely bright gentleman by the name of daniel perlman set his sights on improving the wine bottle , and seems to have succeeded wildly by inventing a wine bottle that doesn ’ t drip when pouring . perlman , an inventor and patent holder who also happens to be a biophysicist at brandeis university , studied how wine hugs the edge of bottle spouts after being poured . " for a drop of wine to make it across perlman 's groove , it would have to travel up inside the groove against the force of gravity or have enough momentum to jump from one side of the groove to the other , " brandeisnow says . " i did n't want there to be the additional cost or inconvenience of buying an accessory. . "
