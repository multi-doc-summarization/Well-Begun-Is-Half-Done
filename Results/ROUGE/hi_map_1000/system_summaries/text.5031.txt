conan o ’ s show last week has turned up regularly in his earlier ratings results , but it ’ s not as if conan was cancelled . “ the 18-to-34 group is so difficult to attract and the lower half , 18 to 25 , is the hardest of all , ” says jack mackenzie , the president of the millennial strategy program for the research firm frank n. magid associates . “ i agree with that . but americans also believe in capitalism , and when fair play bumps up against capitalism , capitalism usually wins . it did this time . to my mind , there are two reasons why leno has come across looking as bad as he has throughout the last few weeks . the first is that he seems like an opportunistic pig for agreeing to move back to 11:30 . he quit or wrongly felt that moving the show half an hour later would destroy the show ’ s integrity . okay , fine . but let ’ s easy to be named because his business competes with nbc . instead of watching mr. o ’ brien in significant numbers in the late-night hours has become a daunting , if not impossible , task . ”
