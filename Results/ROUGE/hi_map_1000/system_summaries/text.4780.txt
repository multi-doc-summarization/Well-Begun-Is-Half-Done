" " the train was not equipped with positive train control , which can prevent derailments caused by excessive speed , officials have said , " he says . " the ntsb 's full investigation of the locomotive was 78 mph , which is within the limits for the approach to the crash location , but not the location itself , which followed a curve with a conductor and that the train 's brakes were engaged automatically , not by the engineer . the recording ended with the locomotive tilting and the crew bracing for impact .
