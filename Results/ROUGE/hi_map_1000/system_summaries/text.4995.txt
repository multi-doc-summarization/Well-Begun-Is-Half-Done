the international olympic committee has reacted with dismay after 28 russian athletes had their lifetime bans from the olympics dramatically overturned by the court of arbitration for sport to overturn the disqualifications of 28 russians who competed at the 2014 sochi olympics was " very messy . " two swedish cross-country skiers , emil jonsson and teodor peterson , had moved up on the podium after some russians were banned from the team sprint . peterson told swedish newspaper dagens nyheter that " it does not matter if we are back as bronze medalists . " " on the other hand , the confirmation of the anti-doping rule violations for 11 athletes because of the manipulation of their samples clearly demonstrates once more the existence of the systemic system at sochi 2014 , " a statement added . " today i have found myself apologising to individual athletes who have had dreams , medals , money and most importantly , faith in sport , stolen from them . they now think that you are better off cheating or getting your nation to establish a doping system because even if it is discovered , the consequences are minimal .
