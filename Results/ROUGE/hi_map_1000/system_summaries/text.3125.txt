researchers are hoping that they can all but bring an end to that with selective breeding . preliminary findings suggest it can be done , according to a team of researchers from over a half-dozen countries , the bbc reports . the team found that methane production , which primarily occurs through belching , was consistent in each animal . this finding should allow the team to breed animals that release methane at continually lower levels . if they can make it happen , the environment may very well benefit by curbing a major producer of greenhouse gases . try that with a natural gas well . actually , it should be possible to make those leak less , too , but it won ’ t involve any cow sex . professor wallace said : " methane production is important for cattle and sheep farmers because if the amount of methane produced can be lowered then there are benefits for the environment , production , and profitability. ” the team is part of a $ 10 million project broadly focused on making these animals more efficient . methane is lost as ammonia in the urine which builds up in the soil and is converted to the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide . professor pekka huhtanen of the swedish university of agricultural sciences , who is also part of the ruminomics consortium , believes that researchers need to take into account both global warming and nitrogen pollution impacts when change is made to the diet of dairy cattle .
