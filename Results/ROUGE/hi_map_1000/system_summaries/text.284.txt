a young girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to average to her father 's blood . but it did happen . i was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name of tom chaney shot my father down and robbed him of his life and his horse and two california gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band . chaney was a hired man and papa had taken him up to fort smith to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he 'd bought . in town , chaney had fallen to drink and cards and lost all his money . he got it into his head he was bein ' cheated and went back to the boardin ' house for his henry rifle . when papa tried intervene , she shrieks at the bored and bewildered girl in front of her , easy not to give a shit . what takes courage is actually caring about yourself and the world . sure , you can call that a hackneyed sentiment , and it is one of the central problems in contemporary life , and 2 ) she 's not saying it from some position of cool , removed with rage , and completely losing her shit at a girl whose only crime was announcing that she does n't care about school and wants to be a model .
