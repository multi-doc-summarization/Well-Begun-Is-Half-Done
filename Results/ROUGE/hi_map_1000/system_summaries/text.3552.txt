a dead 14-year-old girl who is killed by her way home from school in 1973 , tells her story from heaven in the lovely bones . in doing so , susie follows the narrative path set for her in the striking 2002 novel by alice sebold on which this much-awaited adaptation by peter jackson is based . but as directed by the lord of the rings from a screenplay by jackson , fran walsh , and philippa boyens , his bleached bones bears little resemblance to haunt the story , so to speak , making the final product more hit-and-miss than unblemished triumph.it was n't only the bestselling nature of alice sebold 's novel that made " bones " one of the most anticipated films of the year . it was the participation of director peter jackson and his regular screenwriting collaborators fran walsh and figurines and cokes to the part of a young woman just on the cusp of a dead , omniscient narrator . but a device that works on the page comes off artificial and emotionless on-screen . " if you start something , " he said . " you do n't give up till you 've finished it . "
