the government is falling short in ensuring airline pilots keep up their flying skills so they can safely take control of an aircraft from automated systems during an unexpected event , according to a u.s. transportation department report released on monday . the report by the department 's office of the inspector general concludes that the faa can not determine how often pilots fly manually and has not ensured that airline training programs adequately focus on manual skills . airline pilots typically fly planes manually on landings and take-offs , leaving the aircraft under the control of automated technology 90 percent of the time . while automated systems have raised concern that pilots ' manual flying skills are becoming rusty and that pilots have a hard time staying focused on instrument screens for long periods . " the agency is missing important opportunities to ensure that pilots maintain skills needed to safely fly and recover in the event of a failure with flight deck automation or an unexpected , " the report says . " because faa has n't determined how carriers should implement the new requirements or evaluated whether pilots â€™ manual flying time has increased . "
