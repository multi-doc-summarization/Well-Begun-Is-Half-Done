world leaders rallied around the united states after it launched a missile strike early friday on a syrian air base in response to this week 's chemical attack , while russia condemned the move as " aggression " and suspended crucial coordination with washington in syria 's congested skies . the overnight missile attack , which marked the first time the u.s. has directly targeted syrian president bashar assad 's forces , was condemned by his allies in russia and iran but welcomed by the syrian opposition and its supporters , who expressed hope it signaled a coalition of those on the left and right who raised constitutional concerns . " tonight ’ s strike in syria appears to be a proportional response to the regime ’ s use of chemical weapons , " pelosi said , but added , " the crisis in syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes . " durbin said that the attack on thursday night was almost preordained . but there are also considerable risks for mr. trump in the next few weeks , once the immediate satisfaction of making mr. assad pay a price for acts of barbarism wears off .
