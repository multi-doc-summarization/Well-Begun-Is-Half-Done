the relentless campaign to find and sink germany 's wwii leader winston churchill , who took to calling it 'the beast , has been hit by an environmental cataclysm . " we got back to the lab and measured the tree rings , and saw that they were very narrow—in some cases nearly absent—for 1945 , " she tells bbc . " if trees do n't have needles they ca n't photosynthesise and they ’ n't produce biomass . in pine trees , needles usually last from three to seven years because they 're evergreens . so , if the trees lose their needles , it can take a very long time for them to recover . " in other pines , rings are present but they are extremely thin . " you do n't normally see trees in this region without rings , " says scott st. george , a geographer at the university of minnesota 's institute on the environment who took part in the research . " it was n't until we spoke to a local scientist based in tromso that we made the connection to the tirpitz , " said a researcher . " of course we wondered , why is that ? "
