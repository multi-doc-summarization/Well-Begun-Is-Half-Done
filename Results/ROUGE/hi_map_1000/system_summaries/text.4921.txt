a kid from harvard named jeremy lin came off the bench and propelled the new york knicks to a thrilling 99-92 victory over the nets at madison square garden . two nights later , lin made his first start in the national basketball association lighting up the court with 28 points and 8 assists in a win over the utah jazz . wednesday night , lin and gie-ming , who are engineers , emigrated from taiwan to the united states in the 1970s . lin 's asian roots are rare , and that is significant , considering that the nba has been pushing its entry into both the chinese and taiwanese markets for years . a united states-born star with asian ties could be a tremendous fit for nba international and its corporate partners in taiwan , japan and china . lin is the nba 's first american-born player of his remarkable week , scoring a career-high 38 points and outdueling bryant as new york held off the los angeles lakers 92-85 on friday night . buried deep on the bench a little more than a week ago , lin led the knicks to their fourth straight win , tying their longest streak of the season .
