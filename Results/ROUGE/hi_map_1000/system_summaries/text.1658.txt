" when i knew he had went over , i knew i wasn ’ t take the chance , " he said . " on a windy day , you can feel it , and you ’ ll be pushing your trailer and your tractor to the left or the right , whichever way the wind is blowing . you can actually feel it ; it ’ s a hurting feeling and you know of course i said a prayer for him and that was before i heard that he died . i was hoping that he was going to make it. .
