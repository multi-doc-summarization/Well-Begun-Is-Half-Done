the new york times reports that gaga 's new music industry has lined up more than $ 3 million in the first week , but it comes with a caveat to lady gaga 's digital release to an all-new loss-leader low of 99 cents , reports the washington post . " people lose sight of how an artist becomes successful in 2011 , " bill werde , billboard 's editorial director . " she could have sold 600,000 albums , or a million , or two million . but in terms of revenue that ’ s going to be a smaller piece of the pie. ” if there is any asterisk of the digital downloads , it 's not clear whether it 's a <unk> deal . " we wanted to approach this like we were opening a blockbuster film , " he said . " i can understand what amazon did , but i think it devalues music even further . in the customer ’ s mind it ’ s worth 99 cents. . " amazon 's deal , meanwhile , is the top option of the album , which has been released on may 23 and sold 1,108,000 copies in the last six months than most artists will in a lifetime . the album was downloaded 440,000 times , roughly two thirds of its overall digital sales count . so how much did amazon cough up in the process , which they chose late last year to take advantage of music-related high points on the television calendar , like the grammy awards in february ( where lady gaga played the premiere of her song “ born this way ” ) .
