mark cuban took the stage wednesday at inc. 's growco conference in nashville in front of 900-some attendees , inc. president and editor-in-chief eric schurenberg re-confirmed an agreement the two had made before the interview : it was going to be a no-holds-barred conversation . more than an hour later , after cuban had touched on everything from what the sharks of shark tank are really like off camera and why he thinks of himself as a bigot , it 's clear no such agreement was necessary . " if i see a black kid in a hoodie and it ’ s late at night , i 'm walking to the other side of the street , " he said . " while we all have our prejudices and bigotries , we have to learn that it 's an issue that has tattoos all over his face , and the views of millions of others who think like him , is to create a space where those views can be heard . conversely , the way we get the donald sterlings of tomorrow is by shutting up the mark cubans of today . if the misguided views that each of us hold about other groups are allowed to fester in the dark , they will become more caustic , bitter . the smoking section : i can ’ t help but think this is just a well thought out attempt to push nba commissioner adam silver ’ s buttons . this is strictly hypothesis but cuban is too smart so just get caught up in the middle of an interview saying something semi-racist .
