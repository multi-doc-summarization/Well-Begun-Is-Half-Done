china 's foreign ministry said at a press conference in beijing on friday afternoon . the chinese government had previously said it will impose a 25 percent levy on shipments on soybeans among other u.s. agricultural produce and goods including automobiles . the bulk carrier peak pegasus , which had been accelerating earlier in the day as it raced to the port of dalian , was about 25 miles away from its destination as of 4:25 3 . " premiums reflect the rising possibility of china being more dependent on brazil ’ s soybeans , " china said . " we recreated a top-down structure now that has become an absolutely critical part of our economy , " he says . " because of the way spectrum was allocated , we adopted the top-down model in a way we have n't done since feudalism , " the ceo says . china bought about 1.1 million metric tons of soybeans from brazil last week , while no purchases from the u.s. were reported , according to the china national grain and oils information center . that ’ s an unusual move for this time of the year , when china usually starts booking u.s. supply in the months before the north american harvest starts .
