donald trump 's attacks on nfl players protesting racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem while other players and jacksonville jaguars owner shad khan stood arm-in-arm . " when you look at it , we all grew up in an nfl locker room , " ryan tells fox news . " i 'm proud to be associated with those people . i apologized for being pissed off but guess what ? that 's it , because right away i 'm associated with what donald trump stands for and all that kind of stuff , that 's not the men that i know . but i 'm reading these comments and it 's appalling to almost any citizen in our country . it should be . " he 's fired ! " we salute the flag , because the struggles and the sacrifices of generations of americans to make this a better country . that is why we stand and salute our flag and why we put our hand over our heart . he could have come away the winner . instead , he is walking away from this a loser in the minds of the american people for exactly the reasons you pointed out . he was against the federal government interfering and telling the washington redskins what their name are different but lem me tell you : i 'm pissed off . i 'll be honest with you . because i supported donald trump . when he asked me to introduce him at a rally in buffalo , i did that .
