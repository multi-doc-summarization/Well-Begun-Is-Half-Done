a study of nearly 8,000 british twins , who had older fathers scored higher on the “ geek index ” devised by king 's college london , says the mother 's age had no impact , and daughters born to older fathers tended to younger fathers , researchers say . the finding , which emerged from a study , was only seen in boys , reports the bbc . researchers say they were able to produce a " geek index score " for each child in the fields of science , technology , engineering and mathematics . " if you look at who does well in life right now , it ’ s geeks , " she said . " we used these measures to compute a ‘ geek index ’ ( gi ) , and showed it to be strongly predictive of future academic attainment , beyond the independent contribution of the individual traits . gi was associated with paternal age in male offspring only , and mediated the positive effects of apa on education outcomes , in a similar sexually dimorphic manner . the association between paternal age and gi was partly mediated by genetic factors not correlated with age at fatherhood , suggesting these traits are continuously distributed in the population , they cluster together in with their peers .
