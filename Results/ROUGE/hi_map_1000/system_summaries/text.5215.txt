a policy intended to achieve racial equality at a north mississippi school has long meant that only white kids can run for some class offices one year , black kids the next . but brandy springer , a mother of four mixed race children , was stunned when she moved to the area from florida and learned her 12-year-old daughter could n't run for class reporter because she was n't the right race . the rules sparked an outcry on blogs and other websites after springer contacted an advocacy group for mixed-race families . " it is the belief of the current administration that these procedures were implemented to help ensure minority representation and involvement in the student body , " the statement said . " this is not a lesson we want to teach . " the school agreed to the school posted a statement on its website , saying it " acknowledges and embraces the fact that we are growing in ethnic diversity and that the classifications of caucasian and african-american no longer reflect our entire student body . " springer , who moved to lee county from florida in april , says her daughter was told the office of sixth-grade class reporter at nettleton middle school was available only to black students this year .
