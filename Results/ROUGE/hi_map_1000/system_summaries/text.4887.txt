racial slurs posted outside the dorm rooms of five black students at the air force academy were written by one of those students , the school said tuesday . the announcement was a jarring turn in an episode that prompted the academy 's superintendent to warn students that racists were not welcome at the school , the academy said . a spokesman declined to say whether the student withdrew or was expelled , citing privacy laws . the student 's name was n't released . the slurs were found in september at a dormitory that houses students attending the academy in 1985 and has repeatedly told cadets and staff that his highest priority is ensuring a climate of dignity and respect . the academy has struggled with sexual misconduct problems several times in charlottesville , virginia , and amid a debate about nfl players kneeling for the national anthem . " we can confirm that one of the cadet candidates who was allegedly targeted by racist remarks written outside of their dorm room was actually responsible for the act . the individual admitted responsibility and this was validated by the investigation , " he said . " things like charlottesville , ferguson , the protests in the nfl . "
