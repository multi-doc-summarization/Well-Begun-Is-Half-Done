president joe biden will hold off on taking a pay reduction in solidarity with government workers hit by the sequestration budget cuts , his office said friday . " the vice president is committed to sharing the burden of the sequester with his staff , " biden 's office said in a statement , per the ap . biden will take a pay cut if and when members of his own staff are affected . " it is a more difficult calculus for members who are not as wealthy , " one senate aide , treasury secretary jacob lew , defense secretary chuck hagel and attorney general eric holder . some members of congress have offered to do it , too . but , setting up an awkward dynamic in the white house , there â€™ s one high-profile cabinet member who has not yet publicly pledged to return some of his salary to charity or pay back the treasury as a nod to avoid them . after they failed to agree , the cuts were set into motion on march 1 but the effect on some government agencies is still not clear and furloughs of federal workers will take time to kick in . kerry 's net worth , for example , is estimated to exceed $ 200 million .
