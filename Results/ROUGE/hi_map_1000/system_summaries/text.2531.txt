sarah jessica parker turned heads by donning a flaming headdress at this year 's metropolitan museum of art costume institute gala , in a hotel elevator while beyoncé calmly adjusted her dress in the background . the annual fashion benefit takes place monday night , so we ’ ve got your primer on what to expect , including if anything can possibly top last year ’ s drama . and as if that was n't enough , her hands were practically swallowed up in that dress . the blood diamond actress ended up looking like a little girl trying on mommy 's clothes . and poor maggie ! she tried in that floor-length roland mouret number , we just are n't exactly sure what it was she was trying for . from the different-sized straps , to the world 's weirdest waist accent , the extremely fancy , exclusive event is held every year to raise money for the institute and kick off the new spring exhibit . she was two hours late . her dress could have been a strong contestant in the kim k/jlo met gala bare derriere face-off . and we are just … depressed . spare us , beyhive .
