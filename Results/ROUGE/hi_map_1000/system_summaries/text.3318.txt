travelers on british airways and its sister airlines in spain faced a third day of delays and cancellations monday , mainly on short-haul flights in europe , after the company suffered a colossal it failure over the weekend . ba chief executive alex cruz said that the airline was running a " near-full operation " at london 's gatwick airport and planned to operate all scheduled long-haul services from heathrow . but he said there would still be delays , as well as some canceled short-haul flights . alex cruz told sky news the problems were down to ba cutting " hundreds of dedicated and loyal " it staff and contracting the work out to india to save money . " i can confirm that all the parties involved around this particular event have not been involved in any type of outsourcing in any foreign country , " he said . " they have all been local issues around a local data centre who have been managed and fixed by local resources . " cruz said there was " no evidence whatsoever " a cyberattack was behind the computer problems . he added that no ba passengers ’ data had been compromised in the travel chaos at the weekend that grounded flights at heathrow and gatwick , but denied the disruption had anything to do with cost-cutting in the business . giving his first media interview since a major outage caused the airline ’ s it system to collapse last saturday , he refused to resign and said the problem was not a result of outsourcing jobs to other countries .
