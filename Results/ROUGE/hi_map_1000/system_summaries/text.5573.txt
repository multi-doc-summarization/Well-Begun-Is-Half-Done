sarah palin is not laughing about the very nsfw twitter rant azealia banks went on monday in which she said that the rapper fired back on twitter with an incestuous trailer park joke about the alaskan governor-turned-tv personality 's family . why are they fighting , you ask ? let 's rewind . their twitter rumble all started with a satirical news article from newslo.com on march 31 that banks seems to have believed was real ; it jokingly quoted palin telling an alaska newspaper that african americans " enjoyed " being slaves . " in my honest defense , i was completely kidding . i happen to have a really crass , new-york-city sense of humor , " he said . " if bristol palin listened to my music she probably wouldn â€™ t have all . " palin , 52 , responded tuesday morning on twitter and facebook . " hey female rapper , " palin addressed banks in a post . " listen up , little darling . no one has any idea what you 're wigging out about in these bizarre , violent rants against me , but you 're obviously not exercising enough intelligence to acknowledge you 've been sucked into believing some fake interview in which i supposedly offered comments representing the antithesis of my truth .
