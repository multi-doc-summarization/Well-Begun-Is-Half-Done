a house committee killed legislation that would have closed union county-based tennessee virtual academy on tuesday after one knoxville legislator effectively blocked another from talking to the committee about allegations that the for-profit school altered the bad grades of some students . " the only people that are benefiting are in k12 , a virginia corporation that is rising statewide to siphon off millions of dollars every year ... for enormous profits , " stewart said , per the bbc . " those changes we need to make are deleting grades from the computer system , " he said . " in my mind , sure , delete it so that all that is showing is november progress . " stewart told the committee that the company receives $ 5,300 per student " essential to turn on a website " and has refused to give any information on how much it spends . " if you have given an assignment and most of your students failed that assignment , then you need to take that grade out , " said stewart , who is now chairman of the house education committee and sponsor of the haslam administration bill changing some rules for running virtual schools .
