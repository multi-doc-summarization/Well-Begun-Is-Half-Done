denis finley , editor of the paper in bernie sanders ' hometown , screwed up . if oprah winfrey was the media 's big winner for her golden globes peroration on sexual harassment , finley was a <unk> world where reporters and editors were n't tweeting their views on everything from whom they 'd seen at lunch . " i really just wanted to ask the question : 'why is that awesome ? and why is that necessary ? ' that â€™ s all , and i think any journalist would ask that question , " he said . " how i 'm a top gannett official , i might now be wondering if a second bomb cyclone affecting new england is actually on my payroll . " " i do n't care who designed them , destroy all office buildings , " anderson asked . " not all recognition is awesome . " finley was either high-mindedly engaged in a socratic inquiry , as if teaching a constitutional law seminar , or manifesting jonesean ( as in alex jones , of infowars ) subtlety cum does n't seem to care that , when he enters the arena as executive editor , he carries the reputation of his news organization with him . 'reader engagement ' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree , " all recognition ? any recognition , tim ? what if someone said it 's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses ? i 'm not being snarky . "
