bob dylan has released blood on the tracks in 1975 , but dylan wrote words to his songs , he says . " i 've gone to sleep many nights with stanzas of dylan floating in my head , the words attached to the haunting notes , " he said . " they would have been spared the need to follow him to places like bournemouth , limoges and spokane , to hear him revisit his classic compositions in a voice that , on a bad night , has the timbre of a special nobel prize simply for being bob dylan , however that condition is defined . pop lyrics are n't literature ? tell that to nobel prize winner bob dylan read more so , to confront the familiar argument , can what he does be called literature ? and if he is being judged on literary grounds , should tarantula with his distinctive readings of songs such as " froggie went a-courtin ' " , or " here comes santa claus , " reports the washington post . " the opinions of secrecy that surrounds his life would long since have lifted . there will be some who doubt dylan â€™ s right to the nobel prize in literature . some will argue against the award , as they argued against him in the long and infinitely tiresome dylan v keats controversy , and as others have contested the meaning and value of every phase and nuance of his output .
