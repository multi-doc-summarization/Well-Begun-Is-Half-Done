a new study shows that wildlife numbers are likely to be " much higher than they were before the accident , " researchers say . " it 's just that the effects of human habitation , including hunting , farming , and forestry , are a lot worse , " says jim smith of the university of portsmouth in the journal current biology . he stressed that this " does not mean that radiation is good for wildlife , " and that the chernobyl of the chernobyl is more than seven times higher than can be found in those nature reserves . " the numbers of animals we see in chernobyl is similar to the populations in uncontaminated nature reserves , " he said , per the bbc . " this does n't mean radiation is <unk> for wildlife . it 's very likely that wildlife <unk> at chernobyl are much higher , and farming . " ( the study notes that the presence of humans is more damaging to wildlife than is radiation poisoning . ) the chernobyl , however , is a reminder for people , but for wildlife ? not so much when the chernobyl nuclear power plant melted down in 1986 , more than 100,000 people were permanently evacuated from a contaminated area comprising 4200 km2 , an area that was later designated the chernobyl chernobyl zone . the number of wolves living in and around the chernobyl zone are now similar to those in four years after the accident . a dip in the wild boar population at one point was traced to a disease outbreak unrelated to radiation exposure .
