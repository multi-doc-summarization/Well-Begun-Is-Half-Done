a terminally ill british child has attracted the attention of both the president of the united states and the pope . more than 1.3 million pounds ( $ 1.68 million ) has been raised to help 11-month-old charlie gard travel to america for treatment . but little has changed for baby charlie , who suffers from a rare genetic disease that has left him brain damaged and unable to breathe on his own . his parents tried to bring him to the u.s. for an experimental treatment , but that effort that was blocked by the courts after doctors said it would not help him . both pope francis and president trump have offered to help gard , with mr. trump weighing in on the matter with a tweet earlier this week . " alternatively , if approved by the fda , we will arrange shipment of the experimental drug to great ormond street hospital and advise their medical staff on administering it if they are willing to do so , " british foreign minister boris johnson announced earlier this statement that he supported the courts ' decisions . " the foreign secretary said this was a deeply tragic and complex case for all involved , and said it was right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion , which emphasises the need for more research , and we hope that you will all continue to support us in honouring the life of our little warrior as he helps other poorly children and their families .
