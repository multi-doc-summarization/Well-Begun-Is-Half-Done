scientists are the best evidence to date of visual signs acting as a barrier to breeding across species , the new york times reports . the researchers used human facial recognition technology to identify primate features from photographs . they found that guenons ' unusual fur and facial features were meant to send " i 'm different " signals to other monkeys . " animals use coloration and patterning for a whole host of different reasons , and we think guenons are using their patterns to recognize different species , " says study lead author william allen . the university of hull in the journal nature communications and researchers say that the software algorithm recognizes facial features in a manner similar to how the guenon monkeys do it . it turns out the facial patterns are remarkably similar within a guenon species , as well as how the patterns differed among species . " our findings offer evidence for the use of visual signals to help ensure species recognition : species may evolve to look distinct specifically from the other species they are at risk of interbreeding with , " he said . " if guenons mate have some of the most colorful and quirky faces of all primates . "
