the jacksonville international airport was shut down for nearly five hours , stranding incoming planeloads of passengers on the tarmac , after police found two suspicious packages , one of which was deemed " destructive " and had to be deactivated offsite by a bomb squad . the airport was evacuated shortly after 6 p.m. tuesday when police found one suspicious package in the terminal and another in a nearby parking garage , jacksonville sheriff 's office spokesman shannon hartley says . arlie gentry , a passenger who arrived on a flight from new york via baltimore , said the southwest airlines plane he was on landed just before 6:30 . " the airlines will work to ensure all passengers will receive their luggage , " the airport tweeted . " they told us we could n't get off the plane . " he says he was never really concerned for his safety , because the plane remained so far from the terminal . gentry 's sisters had been waiting in the parking lot for several hours and were planning to take him back to gainesville , the ap reports . gentry said the delay was cumbersome and bothersome , but everyone on his plane remained calm . he would not say how many planes were held up or for how long . airport officials tweeted shortly after the evacuation that passengers on inbound flights would be bused to offsite hotels as transportation became available .
