california fish market owner buys 70-pound octopus just to set it free an octopus accidentally caught by a crab fisherman in san luis obispo county had an unexpected savior : the owner of a fish market . giovanni degarimore , owner of giovanni 's fish market , is usually in the business of selling fresh seafood to customers in morro bay . but this 70-pound , eight-legged told the tribune he used to sell octopus , but could n't bring himself do it any longer after a close encounter with one of the cephalopods while diving in fiji . " really it just came down to a personal decision for gio . he 's an avid diver and lover of the ocean , and though gio makes his livelihood on selling seafood , he felt conflicted when it came to these magnificent and arguably sentient beings , " he said . " we give them clams and mussels in order to figure out which they like best . they are very strong , but we found they prefer how octopuses figure out how to open clams and what sort of flexibility and variety they have . " the aquarium 's education manager tara treiber says he released the octopus back into the water the following day .
