nasa 's curiosity rover has found evidence of an ancient martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches . " you 've got an alluvial fan , which is being fed by streams that originate in mountains , that accumulates a body of water , " grotzinger told space.com . " that probably was not unlike what happened during the last glacial maximum in the western us . " the curiosity team has been on mars for almost a year and a half now , just delivered its largest and most important downlink so far of findings , discoveries , and conclusions . " if you put together all that we 're learning about gale crater and mars , you really begin to chip away the rock and the sculpture inside emerges , " pan conrad , an astrobiologist with nasa 's goddard space flight center and a co-author on several of the papers . as described in the six science papers , that hidden but slowly materializing landscape looks something like this : 1 . water once flowed on many parts of mars . and that water was there at times and in forms that scientists did n't believe to be possible not long ago . one of the major achievements of curiosity 's $ 2.5 billion mission is to determine whether gale crater could ever have supported microbial life .
