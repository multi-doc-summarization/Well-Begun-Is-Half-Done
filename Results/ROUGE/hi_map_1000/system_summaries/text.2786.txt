a study from the us national institutes of health presents some of the most precise human data yet on whether cutting carbs can lead to greater body fat loss than carb restriction , even though a low-carb diet reduces insulin and increases fat burning . since 2003 , kevin hall , phd , niddk senior investigator and lead study author . " but interestingly , study participants lost even more body fat during the fat-restricted diet , as it resulted in a greater imbalance between the fat eaten and fat burned . these findings counter the theory that carbohydrate fat loss necessarily requires decreasing insulin , thereby increasing the release of stored fat from fat tissue and increasing the amount of fat burned by the body , whereas the effects of diet on weight loss is often confounded by the difficulty in measuring what people actually eat -- participants may not adhere to meal plans , misjudge amounts , or are not truthful in follow-up surveys . to counter this , hall and colleagues confined 19 consenting adults with obesity to a metabolic ward for a pair of 2-week periods , over the course of which every morsel of food eaten was closely monitored and controlled .
