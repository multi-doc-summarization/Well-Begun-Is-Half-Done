alan rickman is n't the only person in harry potter who 's hard to pin down . tom felton , who plays his character go from a brooding villain to heartbreaking hero who would do anything for the ones he loved , reports the la times . " it was quite amusing , too , because there were times when a director would tell alan what to do in a scene and he would say something like , 'no i ca n't do that , i know what is going to happen and you don â€™ t , ' " series producer david heyman said in the movies , which notes that the first films in the series were being made , jk rowling had not yet published the deathly hallows and severus snape was presumed to be a bad guy the whole way through . rickman having previously told him how snape was a secret agent , working for dumbledore . apparently he had to watch all of it . all the big moments are in there , from snape 's feelings for harry 's mother lily , to the moment ( do we still have to say spoilers ? well , spoilers ) he kills dumbledore . severus is a really nice dude in real life who would n't in a million years be sorted into the slytherin house !
