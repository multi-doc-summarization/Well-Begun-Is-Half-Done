police in california have released graphic body-camera footage of officers repeatedly shooting an unarmed teenager , including multiple shots that were fired as the adolescent was gravely wounded , lying on his back and barely moving . the release on wednesday of video of the killing of dylan noble , a 19-year-old shot at a gas station in the central california city after police received a report of a man carrying a rifle . noble was unarmed , but as he exited from his pickup truck , he appeared to have his left arm outstretched and , for a few seconds , his right arm behind his back . he then briefly walked toward the police . officers continued shouting at him to show his hands , get on the ground and stop advancing . " they just wanted to shoot him , " said darren noble , dylan 's father . " i fâ€”ing hate my life , " noble shouts a split-second before an officer shoots him twice . the video shows that officers approached noble with their guns pointed at him and repeatedly shouted : " let me see your hands . " police claim that the officers believed noble had a gun , though they later learned he had no weapons on him or in the pickup truck . blurry video from a witness that emerged last week captured the final bullets that killed noble , but the body-camera footage provides a much fuller picture of the shooting .
