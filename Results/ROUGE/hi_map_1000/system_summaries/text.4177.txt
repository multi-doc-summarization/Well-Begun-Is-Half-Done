sen. john mccain says he will no longer support richard mourdock , unless the indiana senate candidate apologizes for his recent comments on rape . " if he apologizes and says he misspoke and he was wrong and asks the people to forgive him , then obviously i â€™ d be the first . ... but , you know , in the years that i 'm up to it , " he said . " i struggled with it myself for a long time , but i came to realize life is that gift from god . i think that even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that it is something that god intended to happen . " romney 's call for an apology comes as mitt romney faces mounting pressure from democrats to withdraw his endorsement of mourdock and have a tv ad he starred in for the indiana state treasurer removed from the airwaves , the ap reports . romney 's campaign confirmed wednesday that he continues to support mourdock and has not asked that the ad be pulled . romney campaign spokeswoman andrea saul did seek to distance the gop nominee from the views mourdock expressed .
