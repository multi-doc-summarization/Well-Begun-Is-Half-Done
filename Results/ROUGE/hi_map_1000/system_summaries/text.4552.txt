a man is searching for his dog after he went missing friday night , apparently from a cargo area at lax . frank romano said he was found dead along the highway about a week later . " it is really hard for me to believe their story , " he said . " even gave us a number to the cargo place at tampa airport saying he was there . we called and said they had no dogs . " delta 's family boarded the plane , but a delta employee escorted him off the plane and told him that an hour earlier , ty had chewed through the door of his pet kennel and escaped . romano found this odd . " i do n't know how he could 've bit through his kennel though when it had a metal door and was made of hard plastic , " said the owner . romano was in the cargo area in a carrier romano . he said he and his girlfriend had adopted a stray dog in mexico in 2010 , spent money nursing him to health and then made plans to bring the dog back to their home in canada with them . delta allegedly also gave them the run-around as to where the dog was with a similar story about an escape , but could n't seem to produce the dog . delta also mixed up two children in 2010—a boy and a girl—sending one to boston and the other was " misrouted " several times before finally being reunited with her family . the dog has not been found , and delta has n't offered help to the rescue groups on-the-ground who are still looking for him .
