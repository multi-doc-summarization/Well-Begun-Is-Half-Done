a vancouver mother and schoolteacher is the first ship in history who traveled around canada and the only link between distant communities in the canadian arctic in the early 20th century . the maritime museum 's featured attraction is the st. roch , a national historic site and rcmp vessel that was built around 1800 by french prisoners of war , a children 's maritime discovery centre , a modest institution on the city ’ s west side . that 's not the only person to complain . " a whaler ’ s hope of the first night ashore , " he wrote . " i 'm normally not a huge museum fan but this one is very unique and focuses mostly on the maritime history of vancouver and canada as a whole . there is a lot of stuff about the northwest passage and i learned a lot that i never would 've learned if i had n't come to this museum . the bathrooms were clean and the people working the front desk were helpful in calling us a taxi to get back downtown . we took a taxi there and he went to the wrong location at first- guess it 's not as common a destination as i thought . he did n't charge us for the mistake though and it ended up being a pretty cheap ride . if you 're interested in maritime history or just want a unique take on vancouver 's history , this is a great place to go . kids would have fun too , as there are a few interactive exhibits . great museum to visit during vacation .
