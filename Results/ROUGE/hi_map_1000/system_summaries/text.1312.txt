a new york family scored a huge payday when this small bowl , which they bought at a garage sale for $ 3 , turned out to be a 1,000-year old chinese piece that sold for $ 2.2 million at sotheby 's yesterday . the family bought the rare bowl at the secondhand sale in 2007 , and kept it sitting on their mantle for years , the auction house said . after becoming curious , the bargain hunters began consulting experts about the bowl . they finally brought the piece to sotheby 's , which estimated it would sell for somewhere in the $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 range . but yesterday , london art dealer giuseppe eskenazi blew away those figures when he plunked down $ 23.5 million for a rare blue-and-white jar from the 14th century at a christie ’ s auction . sotheby ’ s would not identify the lucky bowl sellers , only to say that they were a family from somewhere in new york state . the ancient piece is described as a ding bowl because of the county ding in the hebei province where the kilns used to make the bowls were housed .
