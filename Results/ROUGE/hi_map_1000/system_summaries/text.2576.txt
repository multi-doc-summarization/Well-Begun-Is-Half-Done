facebook users were forced to do a double take on friday as they leisurely scoped out their friends ' profiles . at the top of the page , some people , including verified users , reported seeing memorial banners . users posted status updates to reassure friends and family they were not dead , despite facebook 's message . " if facebook is made aware that a person has passed away , it ’ s our policy to memorialize the account , " a facebook spokesman tells cbs news . " we hope people who love [ facebook user ] will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate [ his or her ] life , " he says . " this was a terrible error that we have now fixed . we are very sorry that this happened and we worked as quickly as possible to fix . " the company later addressed the “ terrible error ” in a statement provided by facebook in 2015 because of a number of high-profile cases where family wanted to access the social accounts of deceased loved ones . user can opt to have their account turn into a memorial page upon their death , where facebook contacts can leave message and share memories .
