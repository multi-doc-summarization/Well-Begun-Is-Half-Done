wikileaks founder julian assange called facebook " the most appalling spying machine ever invented " in an interview with russia today , the ap reports . " if we look at our work over the last 12 moths , think about that . all these stories that have come out actually happened in the world , before 2010 , but people didn ’ t know about it . so what is it that we are seeing genuine social unrest or are we seeing some kind of orchestrated revolt and if so , who do you think is behind all this ? ja : there is genuine change in some parts of the middle east . i mean egypt is a clear case . i was concerned at the beginning over the egyptian revolution : whether we just saw a changing of the chairs and the maintenance of the same existing power structure , or whether something was really happening . but after mubarak fled cairo , you saw mini-revolutions occurring in every institution within egypt , from alexandria to cairo . so , that ’ s the sort of change that 's hard to undo . what ’ s happening in some other countries is a bit different . the situation in libya clearly has an involvement of state actors in it from many different areas .
