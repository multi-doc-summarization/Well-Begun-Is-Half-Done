cats will need leashes just like dogs if a proposal before the kenai council wins approval . kenai mayor pat porter and council member tim navarre , who in the ordinance text cited an increase in residents ’ complaints to the kenai animal shelter about roaming cats and a growing cat population in the shelter that “ has begun to tax the available resources of the animal shelter. ” the council unanimously voted to postpone the ordinance wednesday , with members mike boyle and bob molloy absent . it will now have a hearing and vote on october 5 . the proposed ordinance also cites complaints about the impact of animals that city code requires to be restrained either by a leash , fence , or building . the cat leash law would create more burden for the animal shelter rather than relieving it . " every cat that is currently used to being outdoors would now have to be contained and every time that cat manages to get out of its containment , animal control would be tasked with having to get involved in that situation because it ’ s now an ordinance , " marquis wrote . " i do , however , have a problem with cat owners allowing their cats to roam freely within city limits , where we all live closely together . not only is this practice disrespectful , but it does not have the best interest and safety of the cat in mind. .
