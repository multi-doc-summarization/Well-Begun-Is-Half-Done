farmers , lumberjacks and fishermen have the highest suicide rate in the u.s. , while librarians and educators have the lowest , according to a large study that found enormous differences across occupations . the study did n't explore the reasons behind the differences , but researchers found the highest rate of suicide ( 84.5 per 100,000 ) , followed by workers in construction and extraction ( 53.3 ) , and installation ( 47.9 ) . among males , farming , fishing , maintenance , and forestry also accounted for the highest rates of suicide among persons aged â‰¥16 years in the united states , with approximately 40,000 suicide deaths reported in the entire nation in 2012 . because of the limited data , they could only calculate suicide rates for broad occupation categories , but not for specific jobs . the categories , which sometimes seem to group professions that have little to do with each other , like athletes and artists , are based on federal classifications used for collecting jobs-related data . so it 's not clear what the suicide rate is just for farmers . or journalists . suicide is the nation 's 10th leading cause of death . public attention often focuses on teens and college students , but the highest numbers and rates are in middle-aged adults .
