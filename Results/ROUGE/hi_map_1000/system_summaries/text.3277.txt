john travolta 's new introduction to the qantas airlines in-flight safety video ( played on all domestic and long-haul flights ) has been dubbed " cringe-worthy " by the airline 's flight attendants and pilots , who are annoyed he calls them a " team " instead of a crew , the ap reports . travolta appears in a captain 's uniform saying cheesy things " this is your captain speaking -- well , maybe not today . " flight crews ripped travolta ( who flew his own qantas boeing 707 to australia last november ) . " who better than the genuine aviation professionals and the greater team care just as much about aircraft safety as i do , " he said . " it makes us feel like we work at mcdonald 's . " another staff member said he had expected more from the video in the wake of recent safety disasters . " the whole thing seems to make the safety message seem trite , " said one qantas flight attendant . " we 're really happy with the video and we think it 's really engaging , " she said , per the ap .
