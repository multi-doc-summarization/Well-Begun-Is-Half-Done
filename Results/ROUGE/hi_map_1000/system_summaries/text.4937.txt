the final majority report of the benghazi select committee is set to be released later tuesday morning . the final gop-authored house benghazi report released tuesday included new details of a two-hour video teleconference call the night of the attack , a session led by white house chief of staff denis mcdonough . clinton and top defense officials were also on the call , which was supposed to center on how to get americans out of harm 's way . but a substantial part of the discussion , gop investigators said , centered on how and why the attack happened rather than narrowly examining potential rescue plans . half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting did n't have to do with evacuation ; many of them were about an anti-islam video , which the administration would incorrectly blame for the violence . the report also found that a state official brought up a question about whether marines should wear civilian clothing instead of their uniforms . " this has been one of the saddest exercises i 've ever engaged in in my 20 years in congress , " he said . " i don â€™ t think he wants the american people to see every syllable that has been talked about with regard to this issue . "
