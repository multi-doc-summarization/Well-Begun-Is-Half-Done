a former michigan couple who received a wedding gift that instructed them not to open it until their " first disagreement " said they finally opened it 9 years later . kathy gunn said she and her husband , brandon , received a gift at their kalamazoo , mich. , wedding from kathy 's great aunt alison . " on the plain white box was a card that read , 'do not open until your 1st disagreement . ' now , there had obviously been plenty of disagreements , arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years . there were even a couple of instances where we feared that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage , an age old trick -- unbeknownst to us rookies . after all , my great aunt had intended . it was by far the greatest wedding gift of all . for 9 years ( and three moves ) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust , yet it somehow taught us about tolerance , understanding , compromise and patience . our marriage strengthened as we became best friends , partners , and teammates . today , we decided to open that box , because i finally had a realization . i realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong , healthy marriage were never within that box .
