a bright solar flare has exploded on the sun , throwing out an immense cloud of solar particles into space . with part of this cloud having reached us sunday morning , aurora watchers are anticipating a great show on sunday night into monday morning : a visit from the aurora borealis , aka the northern lights . the sky spectacle should be visible in states such as montana , the weather network reported . the flare also released a wave of charged particles , known as a coronal mass ejection , which take a couple of days to reach earth , the ap reports . " the particles interact with molecules of atmospheric gases to cause the famed glowing red and green colors of the aurora , " writes <unk> . " as the cloud expands out into space , however , one end of it will simply be diverted around the planet , due to the protective effects of earth 's magnetic field . a significant portion of them , though , will become snagged within the field lines , and then funneled down into the upper atmosphere near the planet 's poles , to produce bright auroras .
