james howells , who has been " contacted in the united kingdom , knows exactly where his misplaced 7,500 bitcoins are but the city council where he lives wo n't let him retrieve them . they say it 's against the law , " he writes . " after i had stopped mining , the laptop i had used was broken into parts and sold on ebay , " howells tells the telegraph . " it 's a little like looking at your bank account containing millions of dollars but not being able to spend it . " " it is likely that the hardware would have suffered significant galvanic corrosion due to the presence of landfill leachates and gases , " they added . " if this all makes you want to hop a train to newport with a shovel in hand , be warned that aside from being dangerous , the landfill is not open to the public and " any potential treasure hunters . " i haven â€™ t actually tried to search for the hard drive yet as i do n't been given permission to look despite having financial backing in place and engaging the local council
