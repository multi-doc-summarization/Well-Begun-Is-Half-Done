president trump hailed the start of an old project to replace 2 miles of existing barrier . and on saturday , he ripped amazon with a shaky claim that its contract with the post office is a " scam . " trump and his officials departed from reality on a variety of subjects in recent days : the census , amazon 's practices and the makeup of the supreme court among them . here 's a look at some statements and their veracity : trump : " we 're going to be starting work , literally , on monday , on not only some new wall . unlike others , they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments , use our postal system as their delivery boy ( causing tremendous loss to the us ) , and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business ! " the post notes that the photos showed the continuation of the company ’ s lobbying staff has ballooned , and that has nothing to do with the federal budget he signed into law last week . " increased its parcel rates , amazon ’ s shipping costs would rise by $ 2.6 billion . ' this post office scam must stop . amazon must pay real costs ( and taxes ) now ! "
