a faith ministry in nebraska has started a fundraising campaign to buy out four stores that sell millions of cans of beer each year in a tiny village next to a south dakota indian reservation plagued by alcoholism . the lakota hope street ministry in whiteclay is looking to raise at least $ 6.3 million to close the stores , which are only about 200 yards from the pine ridge indian reservation . the beer stores have remained opened for decades despite state investigations into alleged liquor law violations , lawsuits and protests that occasionally turned violent . ministry founder bruce bonfleur and his wife have lived in whiteclay for nearly two decades , feeding people on the streets and launching programs designed to help members of the oglala sioux tribe . bonfleur said he has talked with the businesses , and " we believe that the beer store owners are ready to sell out . " the stores have been facing increasing legal and political pressure , and state liquor regulators are meeting next month to discuss the stores ' licenses . still , some activists have their doubts . olowan martinez , an oglala lakota activist who has led protests against whiteclay , said she would be thrilled but shocked if the buyout stores were sold .
