selfies at funerals ! a page on tumblr has been forced to share the same plane of existence with the kind of people who think it 's completely normal to snap selfies at your funeral , and upload it to twitter with the caption " love my hair today , hate why i 'm dressed up " and the hashtag " # funeral . " and then one of your snot-nosed relatives will snap a selfie of themselves at funerals and upload them to social media sites with the us " # sadday . " it 's the circle of yolo , which should provide plenty of context . will you keep updating this tumblr ? probably not . i like to think of it as a standing statement : everyone who ’ s ever visited will have seen the exact same thing ( except for this post , which came a few weeks after launch . ) but if someone wants to offer me a lot of money to keep it going—or to do anything else , i suppose—you have my full attention . so what now ? follow me on twitter . or , take a selfie at a funeral and be mocked globally .
