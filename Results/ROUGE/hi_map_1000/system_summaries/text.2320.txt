president obama 's healthcare law is not long for this world . at least that seemed to witness the second day of supreme court arguments over the constitutionality of obamacare on tuesday . even before the proceedings wrapped up , they began spreading the word that obama ’ s solicitor general , donald verrilli , had seemed ill-prepared and incapable of defending the law against an onslaught of pointed questions from skeptical justices , and that the critical swing voter on the court – the administration was repeatedly put on the defensive by kennedy , antonin scalia , samuel alito and chief justice john roberts . along with clarence thomas , who rarely speaks but almost always sides with his fellow republican-appointed justices , they form the court ’ s conservative majority – with kennedy the most likely to break ranks . so it 's noteworthy that they ( and kennedy in particular ) exhibited such aggressive skepticism . the individual mandate won ’ t stand unless at least one of them sides with the administration . it 's worth keeping in mind that all of this alarmism may well amount to nothing . the stakes of this case and the court 's notorious opacity encourage tea leaf-reading and overreaction .
