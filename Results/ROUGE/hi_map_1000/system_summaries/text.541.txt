chris martin is taking the blame for his split from wife gwyneth paltrow , who have two young children , announced in march that they were separating , or as they put it , “ conscious uncoupling. ” i ’ ve got to not blame anyone else and make some changes . martin said his personal issues caused him and paltrow to grow apart . " i think everyone in their life goes through challenges , whether it 's love or money , kids or illness . you have to really not run away from that stuff , " he said . " if you do n't open yourself up , you ca n't appreciate the wonder inside . so you can be with someone very wonderful , but because of your own issues you can not let that be celebrated in the right way . what changed for me was—i do n't want to go through life being scared of it , being celebrated of failure . ever since our band came out , we have been a very polarizing group because we do a certain thing very well ... about two years ago i 'm burdened by this .
