karl stefanovic might have been excited to reveal he had been wearing the same suit for a year , but he probably was n't expecting the tsunami of social media support that comes from tackling sexism head on . stefanovic revealed this weekend he had worn the same outfit every day on air in what became a year-long protest-prank against the double standards his female colleagues face . the today show host told fairfax media he came up with the idea while reflecting on the constant criticism and unsolicited advice received by his co-host lisa wilkinson and samantha armytage , the host of rival breakfast program sunrise . " i 'm judged on my interviews , my appalling sense of humour â€“ i do my job , basically . whereas women are quite often judged on what they 're wearing or how their hair is ... that 's [ what i wanted to test ] , " he said . " but women , they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up . they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them . " women are judged much more harshly and keenly for what they do , what they say and what they wear . " " no one has noticed ; no one gives a shit , " stefanovic tells fairfax media . " we try to be accurate in our record , and we will not publish without a high degree of certainty , but we ca n't know the full circumstances of each death until court cases or coronial hearings are finalised .
