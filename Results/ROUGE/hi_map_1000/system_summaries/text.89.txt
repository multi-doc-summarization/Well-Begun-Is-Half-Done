scientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos for about a decade , and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing . stem cells can turn into any cell of the body , so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease . transplanting brain tissue might treat parkinson 's disorder , for example , and pancreatic tissue might be used for diabetes . but transplants run the risk of rejection , so more than a decade ago , researchers proposed a way around that : create tissue from stem cells that bear the patient 's own dna , obtained with a process called therapeutic cloning . if dna from a patient is put into a human egg , which is then grown into an early embryo , but from revising a series of steps in the process . he noted it had taken six years to reach the goal after doing it with monkey embryos . mitalipov also said that based on monkey work , he believes human embryos made with the technique could not develop into cloned babies , and he has no interest in trying to do that . scientists have tried to create a stable cell line that is genetically matched to the donor and that can become almost any cell type in the human body .
