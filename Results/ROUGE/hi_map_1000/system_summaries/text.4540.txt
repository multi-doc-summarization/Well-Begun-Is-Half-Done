president obama 's convention speech by a president since gerald ford in 1976 , the ap reports . the democratic national convention is over and the sprint -- 60 days left as of tomorrow ! " to the november election is on . but before you start running , rest a while and read our picks for the winners and the losers from the final night of the democratic convention . one person you wo n't see in winners and losers is president obama . his speech was never going to be a make-or-break moment for him in this campaign : people already have an opinion of him , they basically know his pitch , and unless he planned to offer a major new proposal or argument it wouldn ’ t have been easy for him to move anyone with his convention closer . but he gave a speech that couldn ’ t rank near the top tier of his own presidential speeches . the speech will certainly send convention-goers back to their home states excited about the final 60 days of the campaign and there were enough appeals to the political center to make the case that obama is the right home for them .
