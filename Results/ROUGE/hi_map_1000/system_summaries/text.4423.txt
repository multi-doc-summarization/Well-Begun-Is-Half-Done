two mysterious stone rings found deep inside a french cave were probably built by neanderthals about 176,500 years ago , proving that the ancient cousins of humans were capable of more complex behavior than previously thought , scientists say . the structures were made from hundreds of pillar-shaped mineral deposits , called stalagmites , which were chopped to a similar length and laid out in two oval patterns up to 40 centimeters ( 16 inches ) inches high . they were discovered by chance in 1990 , after remaining untouched for tens of thousands of years because a rockslide had closed the mouth of the cave at bruniquel in southwest france . " the origin of the structures is undeniably human . it really can not be otherwise , " he told the associated press . the neanderthals who built them must have had a " project " to go so deep into a cave where there was no natural light , said jaubert . they probably explored underground as a group and cooperated to build the rings , using fire to illuminate the climate of past millennia . so when she learned about bruniquel cave , while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle , she had only one thought .
