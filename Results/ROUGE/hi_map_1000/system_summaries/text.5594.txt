the 10-year-old white tiger has so far spurned the advances of tigress rupa , living in the adjoining enclosure , an official tells the bbc . " we have given him libido enhancers , including vitamin d , a and e. but he is shy and no libido has been noticed in him , " he said . " he is in an enclosure that 's far away from vishal 's and we are awaiting a decision on whether we can move her to a nearby enclosure . " vishal was introduced to eight-year-old rupa , he was " friendly enough " and " displayed no sign of hostility " , " we are considering introducing him to rani , she is a bengal tigress , and she has a very beautiful face . but we can not understand what happens to him when he sees rupa . he runs away with his tail between his legs , " says a zoo official . " if we want a younger generation of tigers here in the years to come , we have to work on it right now . " banerjee is a biological need of any living being and it is required to stay healthy . second , the big cats in the zoo are not getting any younger . " the most suitable age for a tiger to mate is when he is five-six years old . but beyond the age of 10 years , it is very difficult . "
