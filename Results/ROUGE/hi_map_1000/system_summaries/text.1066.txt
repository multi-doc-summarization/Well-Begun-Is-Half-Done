" psychopathic offenders are hyper-responsive to threat , quick-tempered and aggressive , while psychopaths have a very low response to threats , are cold , and their aggressive behavior is premeditated , " says a senior author on the paper . " those with psychopathy are less empathetic , more callous , and they commit more violent crimes , some of which are premeditated . " in previous research , blackwood has been scanned , the men completed an image matching test that measured their ability to change their behavior and choices based on feedback they were getting from the game . " as most violent crimes are committed by men with this early-onset stable pattern of antisocial and aggressive behavior , interventions that target the specific underlying brain mechanisms and effect change in the behavior have the potential to significantly reduce the rate of violent crime , " hodgins told live science . " consequently , their behavior often leads to punishment rather than reward as they had expected . "
