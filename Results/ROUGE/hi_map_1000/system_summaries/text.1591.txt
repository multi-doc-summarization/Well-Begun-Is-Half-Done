nasa announced that astronaut jeanette epps would not fly , as expected , to the international space station in june . the mission would have been historic , since she would have become the first african-american to become a crew member on the orbiting outpost . the petition , started yesterday , is behind the administration 's choice not to send dr. jeanette epps to the mission , but he and several other family members signed it . " my sister deserve a chance just life [ sic ] her white peers ! this administration policies and culture is reprehensible against oppressive racism and misogynist in nasa and now they are holding her back and allowing a caucasian astronaut to take her place , " he said . " we can not continue to tolerate what is going on in america but we must stand together and stand behind our people and ou ( r ) nation ! take a stand and sign the petition ! thank you ! " he added , " we have lost all of the gains we gained over the past 40 years in one year ? no more ! " henry epps wrote in a facebook post on saturday evening .
