the academy of motion picture arts and sciences members last month at a deli in studio city — hollywood veterans who , like him , would help decide the oscar nominees for “ best picture ” and amc ’ s “ hell on wheels. ” “ what doesn ’ t interest them is the current black experience or black culture . a movie like ‘ straight outta compton ’ s highest honor alongside a group that looks almost exactly like themselves ” the highest-grossing movie from a black director in history . lurie thought it was one of the year 's best movies . but the other members say all white men , aged 70 and up from 2 % ; asians and latinos are each just over 2 % , with both groups up slightly . the academy has invited more women and minority group members over the last four years , but with its 6,261 voting members appointed for life , the organization ’ s ranks were on track to remain overwhelmingly white and male for decades . under fire for nominating and many of the nation 's most celebrated filmmakers , the group is 89 percent male and 84 % white , and roughly half are 60 or older , a washington post analysis found . " our goal is to make sure that we are active in bringing in different voices regardless of gender or race or sexual orientation , " academy president cheryl boone isaacs said in an interview . " the truth is , those academy members will watch movies that deal with the heroism of the african-american community or the history of blacks , like ‘ 12 years a slave , ' because that interests them .
