" it cost my player his job . he deserved better from law enforcement . we all do , " he said . " we made a decision that we felt that was in the best interest of the dallas cowboys . we 're going to stand by that decision . " the police department added that it " regrets the impact " that the incorrect information had on whitehead , reports the new york daily news . police say they acted in " good faith " when they initially investigated the case to drop him just hours after the items were determined to be less than $ 200 , the ap reports . police apparently had no reason to believe the man they questioned at the time was not whitehead , but verbally provided a name , date of birth and social security number that matched whitehead 's arrest . police said in a statement about the mix-up , " we 're standing by the statement that i made . we know lot a lot of things about our players that you guys do n't know . on whether garrett was happy it turned out whitehead was not involved : garrett : again , guys , i 'm not going to continue to address this .
