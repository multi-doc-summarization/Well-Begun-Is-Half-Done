the international court of justice has rejected claims of genocide by serbia and croatia against each other during the croatian war of secession from yugoslavia . the croatian government had alleged that serbia committed genocide in the town of vukovar and elsewhere in 1991 . serbia later filed a counter-claim over the expulsion of more than 200,000 serbs from croatia . about 20,000 people died during the 1991-1995 war , mostly croatians . the cases , filed 16 years ago , are part of the long legal fall-out from the break-up of yugoslavia into seven states in wars that lasted eight years and left more than 100,000 dead in europe 's worst conflagration since world war two . the ruling was posted online . tens of thousands of ethnic croats were displaced , and about 260 croat men were detained and killed . four years later , the croatian military 's operation storm bombarded the majority ethnic-serb krajina area , forcing about 200,000 people from their homes . " the strongest arguments they have to say they are justifying their wars is that they were defending their citizens against genocide , " he said . " we are not satisfied with the court 's ruling but we accept it in a civilised manner . "
