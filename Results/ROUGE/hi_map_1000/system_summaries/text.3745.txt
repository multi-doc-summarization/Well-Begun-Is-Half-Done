william shakespeare 's skull was " probably " stolen from its final resting place in his hometown of stratford-upon-avon , england , reports the guardian . " it was very obvious , within all the data we were getting , that there was something different going on at that particular spot . we have concluded it is signs of disturbance , of material being dug out and put back again , " he said . " we have a story that suggests that at some point in history someone ’ s come in and taken the skull of shakespeare . it ’ s very , very convincing to me that his skull isn ’ t at holy trinity at all , ” he says . “ we came across this very odd , strange thing at the head end , ” lead archaeologist kevin colls , of staffordshire university , tells sky news . “ even now , thinking of the findings sends shivers down my spine. ” a team of shakespeare 's grave was sealed in a crypt inside st. leonard ’ s church in worcestershire , some 15 miles away from his gravesite . however , a forensic anthropological survey conducted by colls and his team found the skull in the crypt in fact belongs to an unknown woman , thought to be in her 70s when she died . colls also discovered that shakespeare and his wife anne hathaway had been buried in one-meter-deep shallow graves beneath the church 's floor , and not further below ground in a family vault as previously thought .
