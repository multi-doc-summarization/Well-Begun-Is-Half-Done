" that 's a situation that he 's got to take care of , " coach rick carlisle said . " mark gave him our team plane . they loaded up a bunch of stuff , supplies , etc. , to take over to puerto rico , and they 're going to turn around and come back . he 's going to take his mom and grandmother back with him , and my understanding is his dad is going to stay over there and slug it out with all of the recovery efforts . " barea , the nba 's only active player who is a native puerto rican , did not have any communication with his parents until sunday . he quickly made plans for his trip home after communicating with family and figuring out where help was needed most . barea and his wife , viviana ortiz , a puerto rican actress and model , organized an online fundraiser after hurricane maria devastated their homeland last wednesday , when it hit puerto rico as a category 4 storm with 155 mph winds .
