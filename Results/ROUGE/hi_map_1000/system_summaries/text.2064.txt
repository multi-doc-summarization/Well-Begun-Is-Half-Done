a michigan man says he was fired from his job at wal-mart after he tried to help a woman being assaulted in the parking lot of one of the retail giant 's stores and ended up fighting with her attacker . kristopher oswald , 30 , said he was n't expecting what walmart did next , but he was able to get on top of the man and just when he thought he had him under control , two other men jumped oswald from behind . livingston county sheriff 's deputies arrived and halted the fight . oswald says he asked her if she needed help and the man started punching him in the head and yelling that he was going to kill him . oswald said walmart has policies against workplace violence to prevent employees from assaulting co-workers or tackling a shoplifter , but that it appears that nothing allows for them to assist in situations of imminent danger and self-defense . " the last thing i expected was to not have a job , " said kristopher oswald . " we had to make a tough decision , one that we do n't take lightly , and he 's no longer with the company . "
