the earth 's rotation of the earth gradually slowing down over time , this winter solstice would feature the longest night ever , reports the new york times . the article below said that the rotation will be slightly longer than any other , ever , at least , since the planet started spinning right around the time it was first formed some 4.5 billion years ago . why spinning has slowed down pretty significantly ( with an earth day going from about six hours of daylight , while the sun is up for barely 4 hours as a result ) because of the moon 's mass ) , and before that , the trend was up-and-down for most of the 20th century of the year . the nation 's capital sees under 9 and a half hours of a second . it may be a truly tiny amount ( and it means that even in your entire lifetime , the length of a day will only expand by about two milliseconds ) , but it forces official timekeepers to add a leap second every few years . the main reason earth 's gravity is gradually slowing on an extremely long timescale , but on a shorter year-to-year basis , geologic factors can alter the speed as well .
