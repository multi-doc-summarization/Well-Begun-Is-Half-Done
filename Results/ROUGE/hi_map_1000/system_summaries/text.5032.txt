jack ma 's promise to create 1 million new us jobs is the latest casualty of the trade war . the alibaba ( baba ) chief grabbed attention at the start of last year when he made the highly ambitious pledge following a meeting with donald trump , who was president elect at the time . " this promise was on the basis of friendly china-us cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations , but the current situation has already destroyed that basis , " ma said . " jack and i are going to do some great things , " he said , per china 's official news agency , xinhua , and china 's biggest e-commerce company , confirmed ma 's comments to cnn . analysts had already expressed serious doubts about the pledge , which alibaba announced after trump and ma met at trump tower in new york in january 2017 . ma 's vague promise was n't based on alibaba investing in the united states to build factories or fulfillment centers . instead , he talked about stimulating trade by helping american small businesses sell their products to consumers in china and elsewhere in asia .
