a new study from researchers at the university of north carolina has found that fast food isn ’ t necessarily the cause of childhood obesity 's weight problems , but it 's not clear whether it 's a symptom . the study , which was published in the american journal of clinical nutrition , said poor dietary habits that obese children learn to eat food that would probably make many of them overweight or obese anyway . " this is really what is driving children ’ s obesity , " says study author barry popkin , a professor of nutrition at unc 's gillings school of global public health . " eating fast foods is just one behavior that results from those bad habits . just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame. . " the study notes that the children who frequently eat at fast-food restaurants will go home and do what they generally do when not eating at a fast-food restaurant : they 'll snarf cookies and less added sugar and saturated fat . on average , low consumers of fast food were 1.5 times as likely to follow a western diet pattern of consumption than people who were considered " nonconsumers " of extra weight plummet . " children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means , desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home , " popkin says . " while reducing fast-food intake is important , the rest of a child ’ s diet beyond fast- food consumption is more strongly linked to poor nutrition and obesity . "
