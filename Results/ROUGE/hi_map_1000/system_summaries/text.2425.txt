lindsay lohan wants plea deal insists she 's innocent but still desperately wants to plea bargain her felony grand theft case because she 's terrified of being locked up , reports the bbc . the jeweler first told cops lindsay had been in the store three times before the alleged theft -- looking at the necklace in question . the next day , the owner claims she reviewed the video on a different monitor the second time and saw it differently.the jewelry store owner 's credibility is crucial because lindsay claims the owner loaned her story , saying lindsay walked out of her store with both hands , removed the store necklace , and placed it inside her black chanel bag . " the surveillance video revealed that as kaman [ owner ] was talking to lindsay 's male friend , lohan reached up to her neck area with the necklace around her neck . the reason for the inconsistency , on january 23 , so the lawyers can talk plea bargain . we 've learned lindsay is willing to plead guilty to make the case go away , provided she does n't get any jail or prison time.sources say the prosecutor wants jail time so there 's common in cases like this for the judge to reduce the offense to a misdemeanor if lindsay stays out of trouble for 12 months .
