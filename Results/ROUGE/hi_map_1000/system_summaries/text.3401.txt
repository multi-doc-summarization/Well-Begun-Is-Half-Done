julia robert 's character , liz gilbert , takes a holiday from her shattered self , touching down in italy to eat , india to pray , and bali to fall in love . " eat pray love , the movie , directed by glee co-creator ryan murphy , ca n't muster the sound of elizabeth gilbert being liz . it just ca n't , no matter how dutifully murphy and co-screenwriter jennifer salt stitch phrases from the page into the screenplay , because the very nature of movies Â— is her ability to describe her moment-to-moment , meal-to-meal feelings with such warm , chatty , deprecating self-awareness that even her episodes of dithering , obsessing , or where 's the rest of me ? and roberts throws herself wholeheartedly with vitality bardem 's scruffy sexiness as felipe , it 's roberts , who offers herself as our julia as generously as gilbert connects with readers as our liz . roberts ' relaxed gracefulness , whether she 's spooning gelato , folding her long legs in meditation , or bicycling through the balinese countryside to study at the feet of a revered medicine man , is the movie 's greatest asset . also , she wears a really pretty dress-like-the-locals wardrobe . maybe she can travel light because she restocks her suitcase each time her plane lands .
