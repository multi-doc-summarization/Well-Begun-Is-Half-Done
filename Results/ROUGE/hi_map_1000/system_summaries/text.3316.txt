the sun 's magnetic field is about to do a 180 when the celestial body 's electromagnetism flips and changes polarity , reports the bbc . " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , a solar physicist and director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement released by the agency . " this change will have ripple effects throughout the solar system . " as the field shifts , the sun is gearing up to shift , a once in 11 year event , according to nasa officials . earth orbits the sun , dipping in and out of the waves of the current sheet . the transition from a wave to a dip can create stormy space weather around earth , nasa officials said . the sun has gone through 24 solar cycles since scientists began recording solar activity . watch nasa 's sciencecasts shift can stir up some stormy weather , it also provides extra shielding sunspots this year than in the past century , with relatively minimal activity . " the current solar maximum is the weakest in 100 years , the change in polarity is rather routine , " says one physicist .
