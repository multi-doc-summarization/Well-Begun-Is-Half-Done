the head of the senate intelligence committee says the cia improperly searched a stand-alone computer network established for congress as part of its investigation into allegations of cia abuse in a bush-era detention and interrogation program . sen. dianne feinstein of california defended her committee 's work and challenged the cia on tuesday as she sought to set the record straight amid various reports of disputes between congress and the agency . the california democrat said the cia had searched the panel 's computers , possibly violating the law . " i have grave concerns that the cia 's search may well have violated the separation of powers principles by the united states constitution , including the speech and debate clause , " she said . " the matter is being dealt with in an appropriate way , being looked at by the right authorities , and the facts will come out , " he added . " and while this is alarming , it is important to know that more than 6.2 million pages of documents have been provided . this is simply a massive amount of records . " feinstein said that he had not seen feinstein 's speech but was aware of " all sorts of claims . "
