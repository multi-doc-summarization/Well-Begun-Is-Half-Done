a school shooting victim held out his hand to donald trump 's nominee for the supreme court on tuesday , judge brett kavanaugh looked at him , then turned without saying a word and walked out . " i put out my hand and i said : ‘ my name is fred guttenberg , father of jaime guttenberg , who was murdered in parkland , ’ and he walked away , " guttenberg said in an interview with the guardian . " what the white house said was not true. . he argued that there was no “ meaningful or persuasive ” distinction between semi-automatic handguns and rifles , and noted , correctly , that handguns were more frequently used in crime than rifles are . gun control advocates say that if kavanaugh is confirmed to the national rifle association , which is currently divided between justices who support gun rights and gun control , he may serve as the swing vote to make state and federal assault weapon bans unconstitutional , as well as to tear down local restrictions on carrying guns in public . earlier in the day , guttenberg said , he had attended the hearing in hopes of making kavanaugh consider the consequences of his position on the second amendment .
