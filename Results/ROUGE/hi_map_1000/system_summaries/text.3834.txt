president trump and russian president vladimir putin will visit moscow next week to prepare for a meeting with putin , the ap reports . trump told reporters on friday that it was possible his national security adviser , john r. bolton , was critical of russia in a speech last week , saying , " we ’ re looking at the possibility , " trump said . " i think it ’ s better to have russia out , because just like somebody else , it 's much better if we get along with them than if we don ’ t . " trump , who has said he wants better relations with russia , last met putin in november in vietnam on the sidelines between russia and the west . just two weeks ago , mr. trump would send a signal to european leaders that he does not intend to be held hostage to their approach to moscow , adding another rupture to his fights with the united states ’ traditional allies over tariffs , security and migration . in recent public comments , he has emphasized the importance of the group of 7 major industrial powers to readmit russia , which was expelled in 2014 after its armed seizure of crimea from ukraine . but the other members rejected the idea , deeming it inappropriate . by meeting with mr. putin on his own anyway , trump suggested that russia be readmitted from the group in 2014 for its annexation of crimea .
