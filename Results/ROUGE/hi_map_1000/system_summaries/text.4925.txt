prosecutors in pierce county say they would listen to any information that steven powell has about the disappearance of his daughter-in-law susan powell , but have not offered him any kind of plea deal . pierce county prosecutor mark lindquist told 97.3 kiro fm in september 2011 after a search of his puyallup home turned up " thousands of images of females being photographed without their knowledge , including susan powell and many minors . " " you have to weigh what 's best for everybody involved in the case and if that works out , that would be great , " he said . " but i would not have everybody put their hopes on it because i 've had enough dealings with steve to know that he 's playing a game and he might jerk everybody around for a couple years and enjoy doing it . not that we would n't try , but not that he 'd be cooperative . " powell was arrested in the pierce county jail in lieu of bail since his arrest . his trial date is scheduled for march 20 . west valley city utah police chief buzz nielson told reporters in graham , wash. , monday that he considers steven powell a " person of interest " in susan 's disappearance .
