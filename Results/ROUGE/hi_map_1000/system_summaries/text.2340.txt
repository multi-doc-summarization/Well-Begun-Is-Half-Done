trump has been deporting migrants to el salvador for years , and that temporary protected status was always supposed to be temporary . last year , the administration ended the program for two other countries , haiti and nicaragua . recipients from those nations , like those from el salvador , will have an 18-month grace period to leave the u.s. or apply for other forms of immigration relief , officials say . the status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in el salvador that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless . the decision to end tps for salvadorans is part of the administration â€™ s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the united states will be subject to deportation if they remain . haitians and nicaraguans will lose their protected status in 2019 and hondurans , the second largest group in the program , could lose their rights later this year . maria gloria ceren de quinonez poses with a picture of her daughter susana and granddaughters for tps after the 2001 earthquakes . she has lived in north carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her honduran husband .
