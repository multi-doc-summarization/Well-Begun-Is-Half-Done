robert downey jr. plays a billionaire working with his trusty at a conference in may , says it was inspired by the death of one of his troops in afghanistan . " one of our folks going through the door was killed by the taliban on the other side in an attempt to rescue a hostage , " he said . " it 's advanced armor . it 's communications , antennas . that 's all going to fit in here , ' where it 's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human . " " we 're not at the iron man flying suit , you know , flying at 50,000 feet level , " she says . " these particles organize themselves quickly , locally in a way that they ca n't flow anymore and they become like a solid . " the special operations command held something of a science fair last month in tampa , says jim geurts , who buys high-tech equipment for the command . at the conference , dozens of technologies were shown off , he says . so , a flying suit is not part of the plan . but the first challenge is to come up with stronger body armor so a commando can survive once he kicks in a door . norman wagner , a professor of chemical engineering at the university of delaware , is working the problem . he 's looking to nanotechnology to create a solution that contains particles smaller than a single red blood cell .
