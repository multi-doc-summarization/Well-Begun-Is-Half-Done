donald trump spat out the nickname in charlottesville , va. , and the new york times calls it as " antifa . " " you know , they show up in the helmets and the black masks , and they ’ ve got clubs and they 're ve got everything. , " he writes . " i fought them with the most persuasive instruments at hand , the way both my grandfathers did . i was maced , punched , kicked , and beaten with sticks , but i gave as good as i got , and usually better. . " trump 's " blame both sides " and " liberal snowflake. , right there with “ social justice warrior , and either “ antifa ” or “ alt-left. ” antifa is the antifa to the right. , a defensive response to the growing presence of aggressive left-wing activism . in a world where racist movements form an archipelago of brown-walled islands , with friendly governments in power in hungary , poland and the united states , antifa fights back , and although not murderous , is not squeamish about its means . considering normal political action hopeless , some antifa activists claim inspiration from the left-wing paramilitaries of weimar germany and from the black panther party . they are aware of , or unimpressed by , the fact that when hitler came to power , he crushed the left-wing militias , and that , having branded themselves as gun-toters , the panthers became targets of convenience for police and federal agents . in antifa circles , others don ’ t care much what you call them .
