lindsay lohan claims she was " racially profiled " while wearing a headscarf at london 's heathrow airport . the actress told a british talk show that she was stopped while traveling to new york . she said an airport worker " opened my passport and saw 'lindsay lohan ' and started immediately apologizing , but then said : 'please take off your headscarf . " lohan , who has been photographed carrying a quran , says she finds she wore a headscarf in turkey out of " personal respect . and considering that they ’ re now casting leads like emma watson , it makes what you ’ re about to read all the more goddamn ridiculous . e ! news reports : " i will sing again , as # ariel # thelittlemermaid , " lohan wrote on instagram saturday , alongside a side-by-side pic of her and the animated mermaid princess . " @ disney approve that “ # billcondon directs it along with my sister @ alianamusic singing the theme song for the soundtrack. ” since then , lindsay lohan has shown a remarkable amount of self-awareness for lindsay lohan and changed the caption to simply “ # thelittlemermaid. ” although , it still sits directly next to this photo .
