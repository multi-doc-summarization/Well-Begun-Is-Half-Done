house republican leadership has no plans to vote on any immigration reform legislation before the end the year . the house has just 19 days in session before the us government shutdown ended , president barack obama declared that he wanted immigration legislation back on congress ’ s agenda , with the goal of passage by year ’ s end . some fellow democrats are in no hurry . their concern : a compromise with republicans might take the edge off an issue that tops the agenda for hispanics , a group that gave obama 71 percent of its votes in the 2012 presidential election . democrats want to hold onto that decisive margin in their bid to keep control of the u.s. senate and win a house majority in next year 's immigration laws . if republicans win some democratic support on piecemeal bills , they could move forward this year . but still , anything that makes its way to the floor needs to have significant house republican support and obama is also ramping up his messaging on immigration reform . " there are some democrats who would rather get it done , " rep. mario diaz-balart tells politico . " because i do think that every day that goes by , it makes it more and more . "
