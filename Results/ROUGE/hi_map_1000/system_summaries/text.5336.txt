george clooney 's " suburbicon , " " suburbicon " is a grotesque , idyllic , and ethan coen , the new york times reports . " it is irritating , faux-edgy , tonally wack , strained , and such a colossally tone-deaf misfire , " he writes . " there 's no other way to say it 's take a moment first to count our blessings . retrofitted on the scaffolding from mild patience to testy suspicion followed by snide cynicism , then departs with the movie stolen and stuffed into his back pocket . in a film running a brief 104 minutes , an oddly named neighborhood where every new eisenhower-era home looks like the one next door . those cookie-cutter developments , made famous by the legendary levittown , pa. , development of single-family gold . but there 's a catch and it is skin deep . this is a problem when the meyers family is just the side story , though , a tacked-on and bluntly conceived commentary on how this community is too distracted by their racist fears to see what 's going on next door , where gardner ( matt damon ) must navigate the town 's dark underbelly of betrayal . but you ca n't mix nihilism and earnestness . it just does n't work .
