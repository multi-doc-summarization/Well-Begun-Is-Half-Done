barbara " barbie " soper is letting statisticians get their geek on after delivering her third baby on sunday . that 's because it was the third baby for the soper family born on a numerical anomaly . baby number two came on 9-9-09 , and , yes , sunday was 10-10-10 . it 's an almost impossibly cool coincidence , 8 , 2008 , her second on sept. 9 , 2009 and her most recent on oct. 10 , 2010 . it is now late 2010 . can we send her some condolence cards along with those congratulatory bouquets ? many women who have had their kids in quick succession tout the advantages to getting their childbearing over in one fell swoop : having little to no break in between the kids means they 're closer in age and can play with each other on almost the same level ; once you potty train one you can start the next one and escape the diaper , your baby 's house for the next nine months . it takes a minimum of six weeks after delivery to return to its normal size , but it still needs time to recover to again be a hospitable home for a fetus .
