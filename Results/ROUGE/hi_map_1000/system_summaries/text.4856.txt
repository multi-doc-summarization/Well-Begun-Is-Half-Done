vice president pence cast a tie-breaking senate vote thursday to pass legislation that will allow states to withhold federal funds from planned parenthood and other health care providers that perform abortions . the measure , which now goes to president trump for his signature , dismisses an obama-era rule banning states from denying federal funds to such organizations . pence 's vote was needed to break a 50-50 tie . republicans susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska broke with their party , voting against the measure . republicans have said the obama rule should be overturned to allow states the right to steer funds away from abortion providers , if they choose . sen. joni ernst , r-iowa , says the measure reverses a rule that " attempted to empower federal bureaucrats in washington and silence our states . " the house voted its consent last month , but the bill erases a regulation imposed by former president barack obama shortly before he left office that lets states deny family planning funds to organizations only if they are incapable of providing those services . some states have passed laws in recent years denying the money to groups that provide abortions .
