president obama told congress not to leave town before passing a zika funding bill amid new reports that 279 pregnant women from the united states and its territories have shown signs of infection from the zika virus . " here 's the upshot : this is something that is solvable . this is not something we need to panic about , " obama said . " congress needs to get me a bill . they should not be going off on recess before this is done . " the cdc 's birth defects branch says the agency is aware of " less than a dozen " babies or fetuses who have suffered the consequences of zika infection , which can include devastating neurological birth defects . however , she emphasized that most of the 157 pregnancies are ongoing , so it 's not yet known whether those numbers will increase over time , said dr. margaret honein . not a single person is known to have contracted zika from a mosquito bite in the u.s . they 've gotten it while traveling to a country where zika is endemic , and they 're not comparable to previously reported numbers . previously , just 47 pregnant women in the continental united states , and 65 in the territories , were reported to have zika symptoms .
