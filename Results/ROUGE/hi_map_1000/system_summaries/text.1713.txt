the world 's most precise clock has released a study in the journal science describing what they believe is any variation in how a second is measured , it would be in about the 18th decimal place . " the stability of the ytterbium lattice clocks opens the door to a number of exciting practical applications of high-performance timekeeping , " he said . " one could say that this is like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds . " in other words , if there is a major step in the evolution of next-generation atomic clocks under development worldwide , including gravity , magnetic fields , and temperature . and it is n't a good time to cheer " tick-tick-tick-tick trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms , " writes cnn <unk> at the national institute of standards and technology in boulder , colorado , and the new york times notes that " the ytterbium optical ' tick is more stable than any other atomic clock . stability can be thought of as how precisely the duration of each tick matches every other tick . " " the light is used to excite an electron in the atom . in this model , the current gold standard for time is the cesium clock , a type of atomic clock that an international body of experts has used to define what is the unit of one second : about 9.19 billion oscillations .
