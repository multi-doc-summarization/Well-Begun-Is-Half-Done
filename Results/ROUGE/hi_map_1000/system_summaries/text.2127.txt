a federal advisory board 's recommendation that women in their 40s should avoid routine mammograms is not government policy and has caused " a great deal of confusion , " health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius said wednesday . " my message to women is simple . mammograms have always been an important life-saving tool in the fight against breast cancer , and they still are today , " sebelius said in a statement . " keep doing what you have been doing for years : talk to your doctor about your individual history , ask questions and make the decision that is right for you . " with her statement , sebelius said the recommendations " can not be used to deny treatment " on their own . sebelius said it 's hard to find a woman anywhere who was pleased to hear the annual indignity of baring their breasts to the radiologist after all . that ’ s been rolled out with a lot of rhetoric about saving women the “ anxiety ” of false positives , about the “ gold standard , ” and insurance companies look to the panel for guidance on which preventive care practices they should cover . " mammograms have been a huge step forward for millions of american women , but we still have about 21 million women and girls in america who do n't have a doctor , " he said . " this is the little toe in the edge of the water . and this is where you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician . "
