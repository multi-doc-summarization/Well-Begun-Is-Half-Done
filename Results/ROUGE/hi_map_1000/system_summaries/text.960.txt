texas sen. ted cruz plans to announce monday that he will run for president of the united states , according to his senior advisers , accelerating his already rapid three-year rise from a tea party insurgent in texas into a divisive political force in washington . cruz , scheduled to speak monday at a convocation ceremony at liberty university in virginia , will not form an exploratory committee but rather launch a presidential bid outright , said advisers with direct knowledge of his plans , who spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement had not been made yet . they say he is done exploring and is now ready to become the first republican presidential candidate . over the course of the primary campaign , cruz will aim to raise between $ 40 million and $ 50 million , reports to advisers , and dominate with the same tea party voters who believes that if cruz did earn the nomination , he would not win more than a dozen states in the general election . " if you win , that means snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in , " cruz said his daughter told him . " i do n't consider him a mainstream candidate , and usually to win you 've got to be inside the 45-yard lines . "
