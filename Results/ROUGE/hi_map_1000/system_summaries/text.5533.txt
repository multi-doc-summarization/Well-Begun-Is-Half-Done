if you 've found the service to b hit and miss immigrants , it 's not clear if you 're going to do so . " i left an honest but not complementary review last month but yelp keeps deleting it . yelp is not a tool to evaluate businesses but a tool of political correctness i think . i will repost my review when yelp stops its censorship . food was ok , i 've had much better . i was shocked at how rude my server was . my son accidentally knock over his glass of water and she rolled her eyes and made a comment under her breath . i did n't wan na make a scene , so i got my point across with the tip . i left everything on my plate and had to go to a different restaurant to get decent food . in hindsight , i should have at least plucked the feathers , but i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised . first off , it took a bit for me to catch one . surprised how fast they move , especially with the short legs . finally caught the hen and promptly gave its neck a quick spin . honestly , it was not as sad of an experience as i thought it would be . also , i hope that the manager and cooks of this location you have no right to be mad if the food is as bad as i did and get burnt food they will have no choice but to pay for it .
