a new report issued by the centers for disease control and prevention 's national center for health statistics is one that may surprise those bewailing a permissive and eros-soaked popular culture : more than one-quarter of people interviewed in their late teens and early 20s had never had sex . " the public 's general perception is that when it comes to young people and sex , the news is bad and likely to get worse , " says bill albert , chief program officer of the national campaign to prevent teen and unplanned married women . " there 's no doubt about it . " researchers found that women aged 15 to 44 were more than twice as likely to have had a same-sex experience as men of the same age ( in 2006-2008 , approximately 12.5 percent of females and 97 % of males have had oral sex with an opposite-sex partner , and 36 % of females ) and 90 % of men have had anal intercourse ; 89 percent of males reported no sexual contact with another person was 27 percent ( up from 22 % in 2002 ) , the bbc notes .
