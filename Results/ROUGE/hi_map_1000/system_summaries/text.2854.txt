president trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser , jared kushner , had his white house security clearance restored wednesday , a person familiar with the matter said , after months of uncertainty stemming in part from his role in the ongoing investigation by special counsel robert mueller . kushner met with mueller 's investigators a second time in april and answered questions for seven hours , according to a person close to kushner . a spokesman for mueller declined to comment . " a year ago , jared was one of the first to voluntarily cooperate with any investigation into the 2016 campaign and related topics , " lowell said in a statement . " since then , he has continued this complete cooperation , providing a large number of documents and sitting for hours of interviews with congressional committees and providing numerous documents , sitting for two interviews with the office of special counsel . on each occasion , he answered all questions asked and did everything he could to expedite the conclusion of all the investigations . " kushner was stripped of his interim clearance in february amid an overhaul of procedures governing access to the nation 's most sensitive secrets following the resignation of rob porter , the president 's staff secretary , who had been allowed to remain in his post for months despite allegations of spouse abuse .
