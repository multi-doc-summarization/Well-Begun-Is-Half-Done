the new facebook has found a way to see through another person 's eyes . researchers from uc berkeley pieced together the brain patterns of its subjects as they watched youtube videos , and then produced a youtube video of their own with the results . the team then used the brain imaging data to develop a computer model that matched features of the videos -- like colors , shapes and movements . " this is a major leap toward reconstructing mind reading , but the scientists say it paves the way for eventually being able to see what 's going on in the mind without visual stimulation : but this is believed to be a first for reading a dynamic visual experience . it 's only a fraction of the activity that lets us see moving images . " in a statement , the study notes that the technology could be used to broadcast imagery , it could one day allow people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements . already , brain waves recorded through electrodes on the scalp resonance with dynamic informationshapes , images , soundsagainst 18 million seconds of random youtube videos . subjects then watched the same set of trailers as the algorithm that play out inside our minds independent from vision . " if you can decode movies people saw , you might be able to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog , like dreams , " he said . " we hope to look at more visual modules , and try to build models for every single part of visual system . "
