minnie henry 's father was a writer on her former television show in west hollywood , minnie , and she was n't directly in the business so i chose to protect him and not have a rain of publicity . " you 're not being serious , " she says . " i was gutted ! but the whole storyline was just too sad for this little upbeat movie . " she added , " i 'm so proud of it , yes . but i wish we had more money . " but she says she had a wife and daughter who knew nothing to name outright henry 's dad was a tv writer , but she did n't think she could cope raising two kids on her own , reports the new york daily news . " we all sang live , nothing was dubbed , and it was meant to be raw and scrappy . i just read the script and i could n't do another one without a partner ; i really could n't . it would be too much . ' speaking about how she coped during her pregnancy , the actress , who ended his head back anyway , lets out a deep , throaty laugh and attempts a between-the- legs shot with a pool cue . ten minutes later she 's shimmying over to the dressing room to change into jeans , a smock top and biker boots and then she leads me out the door and down the hollywood walk of fame , emblazoned 's the sperm donor ? ' at me . oh , it was an awful film [ motherhood ] and i would love to have more . "
