the boy scouts of america on friday proposed lifting a ban on gay adults from leading troops , a compromise that attempts to end a fight that has split the century-old american institution into bitter factions . reaction from scouting supporters ranged from outrage to limited approval . the biggest organization in scouts , the mormon church , said it was studying the proposal , leaving uncertain the outcome of a may vote by scout leaders that will set policy . gay rights groups said continuing to bar gay adults was unacceptable , but they welcomed the change for youths . " the general feeling is that this is a bad move , " says patrick boyle , whose 1994 book . " they were stuck in a very bad spot with their constituents divided - constituents being the parents , and also the churches and the businesses that support the scouts . " reuters notes that the group 's board has consistently opposed gay marriage , and was a primary promoter of california 's 2008 ban , known as proposition 8 . but recently it has emphasized respecting gay church members and declared that homosexuality is not a choice , reflecting changing attitudes among members . " this is about a concerted effort to bring down a cultural icon . we must brace ourselves for the long haul on this one . "
