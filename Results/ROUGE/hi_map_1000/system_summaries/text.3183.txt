president trump is feuding with president trump in an interview on monday , but he declined to thank the president for helping to get his son , liangelo ball , home from china . " if i was going to thank someone , i would probably thank [ chinese ] president xi [ jinping ] , " he said . " i keep those that time and love for him , " lavar said , per cnn . " maybe we were doing some talking with some other people before he even got there . " he added , " i had some people that had boots on the ground that knew the situation when we first jumped on there , " ball says . " what do you mean take on donald trump ? take him on for what ? " lavar ball , the father of a basketball player freed from china who also recently ran afoul of the president on twitter , as it should be ( 5-10 years in jail ) , but not to father lavar . should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead . china told them why they were released . very ungrateful , who admitted to shoplifting in a news conference later that day , thanked trump for his assistance in the case , but lavar ball has seemed to downplay trump 's role ever since .
