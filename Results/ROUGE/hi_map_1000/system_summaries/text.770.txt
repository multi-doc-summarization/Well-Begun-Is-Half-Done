the council 's decision is part of a broader national effort to $ 15 an hour on tuesday , as a wage increase bill passed the city council by a vote of 14-1 . it is now up to city attorney mike feuer to draft an ordinance to implement the new minimum wage requirements . the ordinance will then return to the council for a final vote before becoming law . under the proposed legislation , the city â€™ s minimum wage would increase to $ 10.50 in july 2016 , and would increase incrementally every year until it reaches $ 15 in july 2020 . for small businesses with 25 or fewer employees , the wage hike would force employers to lay off workers or leave the city altogether . " the very last thing that we should be doing as a city is creating a competitive disadvantage for our businesses with those in neighboring cities , " says the los angeles times . " there is simply not enough room , enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time . " ( in a statement , he said the council action could " make it impossible for entire industries to do business . " )
