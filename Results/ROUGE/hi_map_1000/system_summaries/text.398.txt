sen. john mccain is calling sarah palin an " outstanding candidate " for the republican presidential nomination in 2012 , but says it 's too early to endorse her . mccain told cbs 's " the early show " tuesday that " i do n't think sarah would want me to , before she 's even able to make a decision " about running . the arizona republican said " it 's very early to start picking winners and losers . " he said he still holds his 2008 running mate " in high regard . " if the bush tax cuts , which are up for renewal , come up again and they say , 'you know what , we 'll just only tax people who make $ 1 million or more , ' is that something you might be able to stomach ? " look , we do n't need to raise anybody 's taxes at this time . let 's extend them for a couple of years , as 45 democrats in the house said that they were committed to [ doing ] , and let 's start attacking the real problem , and that 's spending . " taxes has been active in the campaign , raising money , throwing her support behind a host of tea party-backed conservative republicans and giving speeches around the country . while most agree that tax cuts for middle class americans should be extended , battle lines have been drawn against whether the richest two percent of americans should also have their tax cuts continued . doing so , democrats argue , would increase the federal deficit by $ 700 billion over the next decade .
