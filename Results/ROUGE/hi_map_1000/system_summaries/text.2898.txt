scientists are virtually certain that california will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years . now they say the risk of a magnitude 8.0 quake greater than previously forecast ? scientists in recent decades have begun to realize that earthquake faults are interconnected . in fact , earthquakes can begin on one fault and jump to another . multiple faults can rupture in a simultaneous mega-quake . " a simplification we made in the past were these faults were separate and isolated . in other words , they could n't link up together into truly large earthquakes , " said the lead author of the report , per the ap . " california is earthquake country , and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one , " he said . " in fact that it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few well-separate faults , but with a vast interconnected fault system , " field said . the latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the usgs in 2008 . back then , scientists also determined that california faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a northridge-size quake . the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that hit off the japanese coast in 2011 also jumped fault boundaries , " resulting in a much larger fault-rupture area and magnitude than expected , and contributing to the deadly tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster .
