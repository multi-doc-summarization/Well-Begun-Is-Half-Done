pharma bro martin shkreli 's offer of $ 5,000 to anyone who would " grab " some of clinton 's hair for him during her upcoming book tour , reports the new york daily news .

" it was just a prank , bro ! but still , lock her up . spend your resources investigating her , not me ! ! " shkreli 's lawyers have until tuesday to file a response to the government motion by tuesday , but it 's not clear whether it was a " danger to the community . " " but also because there is a significant risk that one of his many social media followers or others who learn of his offers through the media will take his statements seriously , as has happened previously , and act on them , " prosecutors wrote in a legal motion , per the facebook post . shkreli 's defense lawyers also plan to appeal the convictions .
