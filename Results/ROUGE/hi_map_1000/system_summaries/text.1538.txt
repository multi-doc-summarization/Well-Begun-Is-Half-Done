it 's not clear that the tablet has been used to make studying education easier for teachers and students . " this gives us a different way of looking at trigonometry . one that 's really just passed on ratios . and the beautiful thing about it is that it 's much simpler , " he said . " it only involves ratios , you do n't need to study trigonometry through angles : sin , cosx , tan and irrational numbers . you can do it with just ratios . " the tablet , known as plimpton 322 , was discovered early last century after the ancient greek mathematician who actually lived more than 1,000 years after the greek mathematician pythagoras looked at a right angled triangle and worked out that the square of the side opposite the right angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides , reports the new york times . the tablet was discovered in the early 1900s in what is now southern iraq by archaeologist , antiquities dealer , and diplomat edgar banks , the inspiration for the university of new south wales in sydney believe that the four columns and 15 rows of numbers inscribed in cuneiform , the famous p322 tablet , covered in rows of tiny numbers in angular cuneiform script , simplifies the study of the lengths and angles of triangles , sends most modern high schoolers scurrying to their cellphones to look up angles , sines , and cosines . now , a fresh look at a 3700-year-old clay tablet suggests that babylonian mathematicians not only developed the first trig table , beating the greeks to the punch by more than 1000 years , but that they also figured
