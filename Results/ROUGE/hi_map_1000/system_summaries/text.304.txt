mitt romney bowed to political pressure and gave the public a glimpse inside his personal fortune on tuesday , releasing u.s. tax returns showing he pays a lower effective tax rate than many top wage-earners . unlike americans who rely on a paycheck , romney earns most of his income from investment profits , dividends and interest . the returns for 2010 and estimates for 2011 showed that he will pay a total of $ 6.2 million in taxes on income of $ 42.5 million . romney and his wife , ann , collected millions in capital gains over the past two years , including at least $ 4.1 million to the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints . the couple campaign planned to publicly release the tax documents tuesday morning but gave a preview late monday night to the washington post . " i pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more . i don ’ t think you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes. , " he said . " you ’ ll see my income , how much taxes i 'm ve paid to charity . "
