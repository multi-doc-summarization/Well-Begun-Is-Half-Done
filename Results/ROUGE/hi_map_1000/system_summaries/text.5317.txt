a chinese man who sued local government officials over an attack by a wild panda has won more than $ 80,000 in compensation , his lawyer said monday . the animals are renowned for their lovable appearance but despite their placid , bamboo-chewing image they are members of the bear family and have a fearsome bite . the animal wandered into liziba village , in the northwestern province of gansu , where local officials trying to capture it chased it onto guan . " i saw a panda jump out in front of me , its body completely covered in mud , " he told the newspaper . the creature bit him in the leg and only released its grip when he had time to respond . he had eight surgeries in the past year and sued three government departments that are responsible for controlling wild animals . the number of wild giant pandas rose nearly 17 percent over the decade to 2013 to reach 1,864 , state media cited an official survey data as saying this month , with a government agency crediting conservation measures for the increase . pandas are a major generator of tourist revenue in several parts of china and for beijing , which capitalises on the global fascination with the animals by renting them to foreign zoos . they have been known to attack humans , including in 2008 when a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who climbed into its enclosure at a zoo in southern china .
