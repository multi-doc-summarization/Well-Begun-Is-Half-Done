" false ! maria knew everything because she had read it in the script , where it was described , " he said . " the rage and the humiliation . " schneider , who died in 2011 , spoke often about the scene between her , then aged 19 , and marlon brando , then 48 , even saying in a 2007 daily mail interview that she " felt a little raped " by her co-star and director . in the statement , bertolucci said neither he nor marlon brando had told schneider of their plans to use the stick of butter during the scene . he said he and brando came up with the idea on the morning of the shoot and decided not to tell schneider because he wanted her to react " as a girl , not as an actress .
