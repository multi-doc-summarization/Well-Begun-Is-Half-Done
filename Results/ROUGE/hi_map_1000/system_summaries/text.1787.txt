president obama welcomed his predecessor back to the white house on thursday for the unveiling of the official george w. bush and laura bush portraits . as we watched the two men interact graciously during the event , we could not help but wonder : where did it come from ? not the amity . obama and bush are members of the presidents ’ club and have more in common with each other than with the leaders of their respective parties . we mean the picture itself . who chooses the artists for official presidential portraits , and the one for which he named his 1999 autobiography , a charge to keep . bush loved to regale visitors with what he thought was the story behind the painting , also mentioned in weisberg ’ s book , with a look that roland barthes noted decades ago is typical of political portraits . " the gaze is lost nobly in the future , it does not confront , it soars and fertilizes some other domain , which is chastely left undefined. , " he said . " we have for years been underwriting the cost of official presidential <unk> . "
