president obama warned sunday that the world economic recovery remains " fragile " and urged continued spending to support growth , an expansionist call at the end of a summit marked by an agreement among developed nations to halve their annual deficits within three years . the president 's remarks tempered the group of 20 's headline achievement at the summit , a deficit-reduction target that had been pushed by canadian prime minister stephen harper , the host of the meeting and a fiscal conservative . although there is broad agreement that government debt in the developed world needs to be reduced , there is concern that cutting too fast and too deeply will slow growth and possibly spark a new recession . " there is also a risk that the failure to implement consolidation where necessary would undermine confidence and hamper growth. , " he said . " but we must recognize that our fiscal health tomorrow will rest in no small measure on our ability to create jobs and growth today . " the group 's closing statement included the specific deficit-reduction target , but it was more important for individual countries to craft the right economic policies to sustain growth , not blindly cut for the sake of meeting a goal .
