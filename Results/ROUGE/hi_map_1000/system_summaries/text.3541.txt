jerry seinfeld 's return to the comedy treadmill after an absence spanning a little over a decade , reports the new york daily news . " you have finally done the show about nothing , " he writes . " if you 're a fan of seinfeld , or punch lines , but revolves around the way people are supposed to view it . put simply : it 's a tv show you ca n't see on tv ; it can be charmed . if not , you may find things meander . for better , or worse , the 15-minute show seems to be unscripted . there is , of course , a ring of familiarity about this . in fact , judging by the first episode of comedians in cars getting coffee , i began to spin a highly speculative what if in my head : given how much fun i had watching it , i suspect it would ’ t get in traditional media—joss whedon , felicia day , issa cleaner repair , and executives , after fainting , would rush to get the checkbook lest he change his mind . jerry seinfeld , let me remind you , got nbc to make the marriage ref . seinfeld does not need the web , but that doesn ’ t mean that the web might not , in many ways , be better suited to what he wants to do now : drive around , have some coffee and talk to his comedian buddies about comedy , while you watch .
