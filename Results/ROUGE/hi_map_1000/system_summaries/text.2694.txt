donald trump 's support among republicans has dropped 12 points in less than a week , marking the real estate mogul 's biggest decline since he vaulted to the top of the field in july , according to a reuters/ipsos poll . trump told an nbc news reporter that he would support requiring all muslims within the united states to be registered to a special database , which his critics have likened to the mandatory registration of jews in nazi germany . trump has also been criticized for flailing his arms and distorting his speech as he mocked a new york times reporter , serge kovaleski , who is disabled . trump mocked the reporter as he defended his unsubstantiated assertion that during the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks on the united days , he watched on television as " thousands and thousands " of people in new jersey cheered while the world trade center fell . still , trump is not the only front-runner to slide in the latest survey . retired neurosurgeon ben carson has seen his poll numbers drift and now trails trump by more than half , with just 15 percent of republicans polled saying they would vote for him in the same nov. 27 poll .
