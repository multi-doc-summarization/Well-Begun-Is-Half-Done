turing ceo martin shkreli is a repeat moral offender , but it 's not clear whether it 's a " morally bankrupt sociopath " and " everything that is wrong with capitalism . " " i realized if i wanted to keep my job and my life , i was going to have to find a way to pay for this , " she tells abc news . " and those are some of the tamer comments . so how did a rap music-loving , former hedge fund manager suddenly become the target of online ridicule and even death threats ? his company recently acquired the rights to daraprim . developed in the 1950s , the drug is the best treatment for a relatively rare parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis . people with weakened immune systems , have come to rely on the drug , which until recently cost about $ 65 million . but there 's a mix of reasons for these soaring prices , but the most important factor is that companies like turing are cornering the market on certain generic drugs , and then using their near-monopoly power to hike prices . so why does n't another firm try and compete , especially given that the patent on a drug like daraprim has lapsed ? well , maybe 10,000 people use daraprim every year .
