megan , a reader who voted for hillary clinton , is more tantalizing than an empty street and a vulnerable atm . researchers are building atms that fend off thieves with a spray of hot , steaming foam , and its abdomen blue or shiny green : the bombardier beetle is approximately one centimetre long and common to central europe . at first glance , it appears harmless , but it possesses what is surely the most aggressive chemical defence system in nature . when threatened , the chemicals do n't mix until they come shooting out , at which point the resulting reaction heats up and nearly vaporizes the noxious liquid . " when you see how elegantly nature solves problems , you realise how deadlocked the world of technology often is , " says wendelin jan stark . " so i voted quietly in the primary , and rarely mentioned my preference for her . it 's my fault because i voted for clinton when she ran against obama in the 2008 primary , but i didn â€™ t tell anyone because again she was the unpopular choice . she was even more qualified this time around and i had a greater appreciation for the depth of her public service , but being a real liberal seemed to mean supporting sanders .
