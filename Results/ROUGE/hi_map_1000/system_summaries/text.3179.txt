the new david bowie album is an absolute wonder : urgent , sharp-edged , bold , beautiful and baffling , an intellectually stimulating , emotionally charged , musically jagged , electric bolt through his own mythos and the mixed-up , celebrity-obsessed , war-torn world of the 21st century . the song found bowie drifting nostalgically around his former adopted hometown , berlin , suggesting that the next day might be that rarest of things , an autobiographical work from an artist whose nakedly autobiographical songs can be numbered on the fingers of one hand . such speculation that the clamour was part of the problem : it drowned out the music , which perhaps was n't worthy of the noisy excitement it had caused . the reason people were so thrilled , was founded in the music he made in the 1970s , a decade when almost every new album he released was an astonishingly sure-footed leap forward into uncharted territory . but where are we now ? was no heroes or sound and vision . rather , it was not unlike the stuff he had been knocking out immediately before his retirement , when presumably burned by the mixed response to his spirited 1990s attempts to seize the zeitgeist spirit of the late mick ronson .
