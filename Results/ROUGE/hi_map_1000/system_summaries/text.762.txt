a new study published in the journal molecular ecology reveals that deep within sperm whale 's mitochondrial dna—genes passed on from mother to child—lie connections to a single , reports -like . in 2002 , researchers found that killer whales lack diversity in their genes despite their large population size—likely due to some past event that once dramatically reduced their population . " it turns out that other species lack diversity , too , because of everything from preferences for the same breeding grounds to loyalty to a certain kind of food , " writes <unk> . " but that was no surprise : past research has demonstrated that many of earth ’ s largest mammals , they have the largest brain of any creature on the planet and can weigh up to 45 tons . " " it would make sense to have a single mother in a single area—an ancestor who , say , really loved the pacific ocean—this mom 's genes have been found in sperm whales all over the world . how this happened remains unknown and is even stranger given sperm whales ’ social structures . sperm whales are matrilineal , meaning most females stick together and males come and go , which would limit how far a female 's genes could travel . yet these social structures now restrict the ability of sperm whales to differentiate and prevent new dna from getting into the stream . right now , it is unclear whether this female philopatry is due to geographic regions or social groups , or how this might vary on a worldwide scale .
