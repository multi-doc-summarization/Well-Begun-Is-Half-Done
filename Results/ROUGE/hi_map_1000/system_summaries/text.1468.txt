president trump says he wants to " see what happens " with the fbi investigation into his embattled supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh . " it is a very scary time for young men in america , where you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty , " he said . " this is a scary situation where you 're guilty until proven innocent , " trump said , per cnn . " that 's a very difficult time . what ’ s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a supreme court justice . " trump has been treated unfairly as multiple women have come forward to accuse the federal judge of sexual misconduct . the fbi is investigating the allegations of sexual assault and men 's treatment of women , bringing the # metoo movement back to the fore . and while trump has called christine blasey ford , who testified to congress that kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school , " credible " and " compelling , " women are doing great. . trump 's comments on tuesday were just the latest instance of the president expressing concern about the public outcry resulting from the allegations against kavanaugh and the impact on other men . " you could be somebody that was perfect your entire life and somebody can accuse you of something . it doesn ’ t necessarily have to be a woman . "
