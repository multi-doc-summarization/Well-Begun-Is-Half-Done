the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of microorganisms living far beneath antarctic ice . special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet , where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years . the discovery raises the obvious question of what other extreme environments might be able to harbor life on our planet , or beyond . a team led by montana state university professor john priscu brought up samples from below the ice that contained single-celled microbes over the last several decades , but questions have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process . " some of the graduate students joke , ‘ how do we top this ? ' we can ’ t , " montana state doctoral student alex michaud . " it ’ s the first definitive evidence that there ’ s not only life , but active ecosystems underneath the antarctic ice <unk> , something that we have been guessing about for decades . with this paper , we pound the table and say , ‘ yes , we were right. .
