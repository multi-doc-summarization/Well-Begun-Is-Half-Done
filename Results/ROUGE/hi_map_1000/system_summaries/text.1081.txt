" they all happen without warning , and last anywhere between a few seconds to more than two minutes . in a darkened movie theater , this means the likelihood of a seizure could be very high if you are sensitive to these effects . if you have been disappointed by the creative decisions made by disney-pixar , please sign the petition created by @ moviehealthcommunity for disney to include a seizure warning for moviegoers and people who buy/rent the movie . it is unlikely they would edit these things out of the movie entirely - but there are nearly 20,000 notes on this post , and you can watch it in a fully-lit room , with someone with you who will be able to help if the strobe effects do trigger a seizure . please stay safe .
