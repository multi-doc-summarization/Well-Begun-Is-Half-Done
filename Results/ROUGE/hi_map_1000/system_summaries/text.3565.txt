researchers have laid bare the dna of a kangaroo species for the first time . an international team of scientists , writing in the biomed central journal , genome biology , described the study as " a wonderful tool for studying the evolution of marsupials , and mammals in general , and an impressive piece of work looking at one of australia 's iconic species , " he writes . " it 's always really valuable to look at an organism that is a bit different to understand how humans and other mammals have evolved . " the team says the first kangaroo genome is a milestone in the study of mammalian evolution . the team focussed on a small species of kangaroo and other marsupials diverged from other mammals at least 130 million years ago . professor marilyn renfree of the university of melbourne , a lead researcher on the project , said : " the tammar wallaby sequencing project has provided us with many possibilities for understanding how marsupials sequencing technologies have changed a lot . " researchers also studied the way tammar wallaby genes are turned " on " or " off " at different stages of the animal 's life cycle and in different parts of the body . they hope their work may help produce future treatments for human disease . " this is the first genome project to be led by australian scientists , " commented said . " we have also done some further analysis of the content . if you would like access to this set of crawl data , please contact us at info at archive dot and let us know who you are and what you â€™ re hoping to do with it .
