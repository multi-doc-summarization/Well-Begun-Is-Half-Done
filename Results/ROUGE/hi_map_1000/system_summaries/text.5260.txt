the discovery of remains belonging to a new species of horse-sized dinosaur is shedding light on how tyrannosaurus rex ( t. rex ) became one of earth 's top predators , according to scientists . the first tyrannosaurs evolved about 170 million years ago , when they split from the group of feathered predators that later gave rise to birds . but they remained in the shadows of larger beasts , such as allosaurs and spinosaurs . " the ancestors of t. rex would have looked a whole lot like timurlengia , a horse-sized hunter with a big brain and keen hearing that would put us to shame , " says a team of the university of maryland in college park . " it looks like the allosaurs go out and tyrannosaurs opportunistically take over . " he says the remains were unearthed in northern uzbekistan and are now said to be providing insights into how a family of small-bodied dinosaurs evolved over millions of years to become fearsome giants sounds . " this is cool stuff , " said thomas holtz of the russian zoological institute . " i â€™ ve studied a lot of tyrannosaurs , and after a while i recognised it as a tyrannosaur . "
