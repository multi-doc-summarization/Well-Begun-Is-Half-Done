the massive flooding across southeastern louisiana over the weekend could bring an increased risk for the zika virus after the waters recede , an expert in tropical medicine said sunday . strong floodwaters often wash away mosquito eggs , which would be protected from surging water and then be stimulated to hatch after the flooding recedes , said peter hotez , dean of the centers for disease control and prevention agreed that the coming weeks will be important for monitoring the number of zika . no local cases of zika have been reported in louisiana , but he pointed out that the zika-carrying species is smaller and more easily washed away by floodwaters . florida is the only state where zika was contracted locally , and not from travel outside the country . flooding could increase the risk for other mosquito-borne illnesses , such as west nile virus , hotez said . mustapha debboun , director of mosquito control at texas ' harris county public health and environmental services , told usa today in april that flooding can " create plenty of breeding habitats for mosquitoes , which will increase in larger populations as the temperature and humidity rises .
