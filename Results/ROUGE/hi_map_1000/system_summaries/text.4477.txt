a new study indicates that regular caffeine consumption does n't increase the risk of heart attack or stroke after all , according to uc san francisco researchers . the results of the study , appearing in the january 2016 issue of the journal of the american heart association , challenge the widely held clinical belief that caffeine products can lead to extra heartbeats . " clinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent disturbances of the heart 's cardiac rhythm should be reconsidered , as we may unnecessarily be discouraging consumption of items like chocolate , coffee and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits , " said a cardiologist at the university of california san francisco , who led the study . " given our recent work demonstrating that extra heartbeats can be dangerous , this finding is especially relevant . " it used to be believed that premature cardiac contractions , contrary to current belief among medics , does not trigger potentially dangerous heart palpitations . to check , marcus and colleagues examined 1,388 people , with an average age of 72 , taking part in a larger heart study . about 60 percent said they drank some sort of caffeinated product every day .
