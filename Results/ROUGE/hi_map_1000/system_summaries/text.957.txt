president obama on tuesday called on congress to find budget cuts and tax changes to delay the start next month of deep reductions in domestic and defense spending that could deliver a fresh blow to a fragile economic recovery . with time running out , obama said , congress should adopt measures to postpone the automatic spending reductions , known as the sequester , for a few months . without any action , the cuts , worth $ 1.2 trillion over a decade , are scheduled to take effect march 1 and are causing deep anxiety among government workers and contractors . obama did not outline a specific proposal , and he said he still favored a broad deal of spending cuts for more tax hikes . " the president ’ s sequester should be replaced with spending cuts and reforms that will start us on the path to balancing the budget in 10 years. , " boehner said in a statement . " republicans have twice voted to replace these arbitrary cuts with common-sense cuts , " he said . " if congress can ’ t act immediately on a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect . "
