chely wright has married girlfriend lauren blitzer just a little over a year after the country music star came out about being a lesbian and revealed just how painful that confession was in the world of country music . wright , who has posted wedding photos on twitter of herself and blitzer in white gowns , announced to the world in may 2010 that she was a lesbian . " country music would rather an artist be a drunk -- they even encourage and endorse that one , " wright said in an interview with the los angeles times ' geoff boucher shortly after she came out . " you get good money from jim beam to put that emblem on the side of your bus . i was on the crown royal tour , and i have to say it was one of my favorite tours . they would rather you were a drug addict than be gay . they will forgive you if you beat your wife , lose your kids to state , get six divorces , make a sex tape , get labeled as a tramp â€” any and all of it is better than being gay .
