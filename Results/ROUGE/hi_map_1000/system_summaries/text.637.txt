a federal judge in seattle on friday declined to release from detention a 23-year-old immigrant who had been protected from deportation under obama-era rules . magistrate judge james donohue set a february 24 bond hearing for daniel ramirez medina , thereby extending for a week a case that has roiled pro-immigration groups . ramirez is originally from mexico and had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , his lawyers said . the officers arrived at the northwest detention center in tacoma “ to await the outcome of removal proceedings , ” the ap reports . ice did n't respond when asked whether medina has admitted to being a gang member , while his attorneys denied that accusation and said he was not a threat to public safety . " there is no basis for detaining our client , " said ice northwest spokeswoman rose richeson . " ice officers took mr. ramirez into custody based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public <unk> . " the petition notes that medina is the first daca recipient arrested under the trump administration , which specifically protects children who were brought to the united states as children .
