a dutch zoo who emphatically swatted a tv crew was using a camera-equipped drone to film a documentary of chimpanzees at a 1.7-acre enclosure at the royal burgers set out to swat an aerial drone that was filming her group , the ap reports . the drone got close , tushi swatted at it twice with a 6-foot-long branch she brandished in her left hand . some grabbed willow twigs off the ground , while four animals took these along when they climbed up scaffolding where the drone was hovering . this behavior is not frequently observed among these chimps . filming started when the next drone flew over . " the precise coincidence of the facial grimace with the strike suggests that it is a concomitant of an assertive and determined exertion of force , homologous to what humans do in comparable situations , " lukkenaar says . " this suggests that she quite deliberately and forcefully struck at the drone , rather than fearfully or reflexively . " " this episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts , " he said . " it seemed deliberate , given the decision to collect it and carry it to a place where the second was successful in downing the drone and ultimately broke it . before and during the strike , she grimaced . although her face was tense and her teeth were bared , she showed no signs of fear .
