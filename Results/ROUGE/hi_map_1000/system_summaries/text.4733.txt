david bowie 's dance professor will spend months at a time experiencing the star 's life at different points through his 40-year career , reports the new york daily news . " the thought that kept returning to me was : how did bowie survive the 70s ? he really made himself very ill . so it ’ s fortunate that i ’ m going through his career chronologically . because i think by ’ 83 he was pretty clean . i think i ’ ll get a tan , get fit , and i 'm thinking no one would want to go through everything he went through , not really . but i want to get some taste of it. , " he said . " so at the weekend i had a six-pack of energy drinks to try and simulate the experience of illegal substances , ” he said , per the guardian . " i just wanted to have that immersion . " he added , " it made me very jumpy. " and that he 's not just illegal for a professor like myself , but it 's " much too expensive " as well as unhealthy . " it 's even eating red peppers and drinking milk as bowie did . "
