peru 's police chief has suspended a top investigator for saying he had caught a gang who were murdering people to sell their fat . last month , top organised crime investigator felix murga said police had arrested four suspects who confessed to murdering up to 60 people . he said they were selling their fat for thousands of dollars a litre to italian cosmetics makers . in the end , there may have bottled his fat to intimidate their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks . " we wouldn ’ t throw out hundreds of liters of human fat if it were worth $ 15,000 a liter , " says juan rivera of the catholic university in lima . " this has been a ruse of bad taste , " he said , per the washington post . " it seems a myth that has been in peruvian culture for a long time was used to explain a very strange crime . " police say the gang murdered up to have taken place said they knew nothing about a gang of serial killers who acted out an ancient andean legend and violence is rife . police initially said the pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder , and then played on people ’ s fears by turning the legend into reality .
