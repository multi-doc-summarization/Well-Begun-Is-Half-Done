facebook is finally working on a dislike button , ceo mark zuckerberg has said , but it 's not exactly what you think . " we do n't want to turn facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people 's posts , " zuckerberg said . " that does n't seem like the kind of community that we want to create : you can argue that it certainly does n't want people disliking the right way to do it so it ends up being a force for good , not a force . " the cnbc notes that facebook is n't a lot of details beyond that , but zuckerberg says it would n't be a way for users to " downvote " posts and instead would let users express other emotions besides the inferred positivity of the like button . " what they really want is the ability to express empathy , and that 's an important way to sympathize or empathize with someone , " he said , per the cnbc . " not every moment is a good moment , " she says . " everyone have asked about the 'dislike ' button for many years ... and today is a special day because today is the day that i actually get to say we are working on it and are very close to shipping a test of it . "
