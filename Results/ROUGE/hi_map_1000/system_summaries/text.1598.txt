it 's a good time : the waterbed was just a concept in a san francisco art gallery , and charles hall is a young graduate student floating an idea back in 1968 . half a century , a popular subculture career later , hall wakes up on his most famous design each morning with a million-dollar view of puget sound and downtown seattle . today he 's taking another go at the west coast all those years ago , but his new bed will launch across the country on its eastern shore . the bed will first go to a test market in a chain of florida furniture stores later this spring or summer , before it hopefully rolls out more broadly , he said . " it keeps me young , to be active and engaged in a lot of projects , " says charlie hall . " your body is 90-some-percent water anyway , what you 're doing in an environment before you â€™ re born is water. . " he 's not like charlie needs the money from the return of the waterbed . he has a ranch home in california wine country and another place in that state , and about 15 years ago he bought a home right on the bainbridge island waterfront to help a person relax and get better sleep , he says . " a waterbed is about as pure a concept as you can get . "
