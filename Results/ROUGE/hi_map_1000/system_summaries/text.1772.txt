a video posted on facebook late sunday evening shows a passenger on a commercial airplane that appears to be preparing to give up their seat for $ 400 , a free night in the hotel , and a flight at 3 p.m. monday . the 31-second clip shows three men wearing radio equipment and security jackets speaking with a man identified as elizabethtown doctor david dao seated on the plane . after a few seconds , one of the men grabs the passenger , who screams , and the offer was increased to $ 800 , but no one volunteered . then , she said , a manager came aboard the plane and said a computer would select four people to be taken off the flight . passengers were told that the flight would not take off until the united crew had seats , bridges said , before the man in the video reportedly said he was unwilling to surrender his seat because he was a doctor and had patients to see in the louisville area monday morning . he was then aggressively dragged from the plane , his face bloodied by officers forcing him out of his seat .
