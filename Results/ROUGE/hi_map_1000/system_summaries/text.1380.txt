the discovery of 150-million-year-old fossils in siberia indicates that feathers were much more widespread among dinosaurs than previously thought . the find " has completely changed our vision of dinosaurs " , the lead researcher told bbc . " some will have had feathers as young animals and kept them throughout their lives . others may have lost feathers as they grew up , and became large enough not to need them , or replaced feathers with scales or relied on bony plates in the skin for protection , " he said . " no bird has that structure in any part of its plumage and none of the developmental models that biologists use to understand the evolution of feathers includes a stage that has anything like that kind of anatomy . " he added , " the key point is that dinosaurs were all initially feathered and warm blooded , confirmation of an idea that has prevailed for years , he said , " per bbc . the discovery , which has been published in the journal science , says it 's a " big discovery . " " our research does n't mean that all dinosaurs had feathers , especially as adults , " she said , per politico . " instead of thinking of dinosaurs as dry , scary scaly creatures a lot of them actually had a fluffy , downy covering like feathers on a chick . "
