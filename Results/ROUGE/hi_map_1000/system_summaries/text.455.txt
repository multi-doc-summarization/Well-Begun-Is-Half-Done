a new study suggests that the disaster is a surprising yes , but it 's not clear whether the disaster has been near the silver creek caldera , the new york times reports . " i would n't recommend anyone try to outrun a volcano , but there 's a few of us that could , " said greg valentine , a volcanologist at the university at buffalo in new york . " they still devastate a huge area , but they 're slow and concentrated and dense , " he said . " but this is n't consistent with what we found . " the new study , however , says that the safest way to deal with any rumbling volcano is to rush outward from the caldera volcano for more than 150 miles per hour . " intuitively , most of us would think that for the pyroclastic flow to go such an extreme distance , it would have to start off with a very high speed , " study co-author olivier roche says . " it 's really interesting how you can have such a violent eruption producing such slow-moving flows , " valentine says .
