michael bloomberg , the billionaire media owner of the republican and democratic national committees on wednesday weighed in on the prospect of an independent presidential run by michael bloomberg . dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz suggested that the former new york city mayor 's priorities are already " well cared-for " in the democratic platform , while rnc leader reince priebus welcomed the idea , saying bloomberg would siphon off votes from the democratic candidate . the billionaire recently told the financial times he found " the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters , " bloomberg reports . " on the contrary , they would roll back progress on issues like education and consumer protection and gun safety and protecting people from people who would do them harm , " he said . " even if he did win a few electoral votes , then he would put the race in the hands of ( house speaker ) paul ryan and i would imagine paul 's going to choose the republican . " bloomberg notes that bloomberg has been running for the oval office in previous elections , but only because he views the billionaire as a spoiler who would cull most of his support from the eventual democratic nominee .
