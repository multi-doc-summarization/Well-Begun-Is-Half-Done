the discovery of an uninjured two-year-old boy who went missing in woods in western japan has been found unharmed after three days alone , apparently surviving on river water as volunteers hunted desperately for him . yoshiki fujimoto disappeared on sunday morning in the yamaguchi region while out walking with his brother and grandfather , and the search for him made headlines nationwide . yoshiki and experts were surprised that the boy was found alive as temperatures on the island topped 30 degrees celsius ( 86 fahrenheit ) between sunday and tuesday . " i was most worried about possible heatstroke but the boy may have found shade near the stream and drunk water . it must have been a result of a number of miraculously favourable conditions , " says a professor at ehime university 's paediatrics department . " but there he was . i thought my heart was going to stop . " the boy 's 66-year-old mother burst into tears when she saw him . " he does n't have any major injuries , just a few scratches and slight dehydration , " he tells local television , a red towel wrapped around his head against the summer heat . " at first , i did n't think it was a human . " a doctor said he was suffering from dehydration and had scratches and tick bites on his skin , but no obvious injuries . the child clung to his mother , saying , " i found him sitting on a moss-covered rock in the middle of a mountain stream , with his feet dangling in the water .
