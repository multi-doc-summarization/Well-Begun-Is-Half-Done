chronic marijuana use by teenage boys does not appear to be linked to later physical or mental health issues such as depression , psychotic symptoms or asthma , according to a study published by the american psychological association . researchers from the university of pittsburgh medical center and rutgers university tracked 408 from adolescence into their mid-30s for the study , which was published in psychology of addictive behaviors . " there were no differences in any of the mental or physical health outcomes that we measured regardless of the amount or frequency of marijuana used during adolescence , " says lead researcher jordan bechtold , phd , a psychology research fellow at the university . " what we found was a little surprising , " he said . the study also found no link between teen marijuana use and lifetime depression , anxiety , allergies , headaches or high blood pressure . they then compared the health status of these groups to one another , controlling for factors like tobacco use and socioeconomic status . " [ f ] indings from this sample indicated that chronic marijuana users were not more likely than late increasing users , adolescence-limited users , or low/nonusers to experience several physical problems in their mid-30s , " they wrote .
