this city is full of parks that invite exercise and bike lanes life expectancies , a poor person living in the san francisco area can expect to live about three years longer than someone making the same income in detroit . that difference is equivalent to how much national life expectancies would rise if we eliminated cancer . " if you think about the cancer comparison , having cancer is not just about having a shorter life . it 's also about having an unhealthier life , a much lower quality of life , " says stanford economist raj chetty , the lead author of the american medical association . seven economists , from mit , harvard , the u.s. treasury and mckinsey and co. , were co-authors . think about their new data as if the poor in detroit get cancer and the poorest in san francisco do n't . " i would have thought these very expensive big cities , like new york city and san francisco , for most poor would be stressful and would be places with poor health among the poor , but that 's not at all what these data suggest .
