the woman accused of posting a photo of a dog with its mouth wrapped in duct tape on facebook was arrested in north carolina . on friday , lemansky was charged with cruelty to animals by the cary police department after she told police that the incident happened in cary . it 's not clear how south daytona police tracked her to cary . " taping the dog 's muzzle shut was a terrible decision on ms. lemansky 's part , and charging her with animal cruelty under north carolina law was the right thing to do , " cary police captain randall rhyne tells police . " the dogs are current on their shots , spayed , and microchipped . they are clean and well-nourished and appear to be comfortable in their surroundings . and there were no signs of injury to brown 's muzzle , not even detectable hair loss . " police say there are no additional charges pending against lemansky . " at the same time , it 's important to also note that our animal control officers who physically examined both brown and her littermate found the dogs to be very well cared for , which is why we did not and could not remove them from the owner , " he said . " how people could even arrive at this . "
