the afghan government has set up a delegation to investigate reports of torture in afghan-run detention facilities . the delegation , which was announced on tuesday , was created two days after the united nations assistance mission in government custody were being tortured and abused.a presidential office statement on january 22 said the delegation will " fully investigate the claims of torture , mistreatment , death threats and sexual abuse in prisons , and any faults or misconduct during questioning and trial of detainees . " the un report , based on interviews with hundreds of detainees held in 89 facilities between october 2011 and october 2012 , details 14 abusive practices , including the twisting of genitals , extracting fingernails and electric shock . perhaps most damning is a statement by an unnamed operative within the agency , who is quoted as saying " nds has several secret places in which they detain and torture people . " " people say they were beaten , but where are the bruises ? if we rip out people 's fingernails , then show the scars . prove it , " the official said . " they will only speak in front of nds authorities , to people they are confident will not speak up against the detention authorities . "
