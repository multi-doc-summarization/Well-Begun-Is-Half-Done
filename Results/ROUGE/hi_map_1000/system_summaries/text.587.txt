south korea said tuesday it will investigate emission levels of volkswagen diesel vehicles after the world 's top-selling automaker admitted cheating u.s. tests . park pan-kyu , a deputy director at south korea 's environment ministry , said that four models had much higher emissions than tests had suggested . french finance minister michel sapin has called for an eu inquiry , but a uk car industry spokesman said there was " no evidence " of cheating . mike hawes , who is chief executive of the uk 's society of motor manufacturers and traders , said the eu operated a " fundamentally different system " from the us , with tests performed in strict conditions and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency . " we are a european market with european rules , " he said . " vehicles are removed from the production line randomly and must be standard production models , certified by the relevant authority - the uk body being the vehicle certification agency , which is responsible to the department for transport . " france , the south korean government said it would test up to 5,000 jetta and golf cars , along with audi a3s made in 2014 and 2015 . its investigation will be expanded to all german diesel cars if issues are found . vw shares plunged nearly 20 % on monday after losing almost a fifth of their value on monday .
