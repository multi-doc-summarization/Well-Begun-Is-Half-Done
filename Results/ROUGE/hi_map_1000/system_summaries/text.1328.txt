a swiss hospital that treated sergio marchionne says the former fiat chrysler ceo received treatment for a serious illness for more than a year before he died . " due to medical privacy , the company was made aware with no detail by mr. marchionne 's family of the serious deterioration in mr. marchionne â€™ s condition and that as a result he would be unable to return to work , " a fiat chrysler spokesman tells reuters . " although all the options offered by cutting-edge medicine were utilized , mr. marchionne unfortunately passed away . " the hospital said it was " critical to the execution of our strategic direction and implementation of our business plan . " " we have developed succession plans that we believe are appropriate , although it is difficult to predict with any certainty that we will be able to replace these [ executives ] with persons of equivalent experience and capabilities , " the company says . the company said that marchionne had been raised in the media over how long marchionne had fallen gravely ill after what the company had described as shoulder surgery at a zurich hospital .
