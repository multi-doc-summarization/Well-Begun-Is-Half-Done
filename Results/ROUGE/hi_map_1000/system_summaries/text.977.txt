" it referred to total fabrications — made-up stories about donald trump suffering a heart attack or earning the idea that “ negative equals fake ” is probably very low . more insidious is the notion that a report qualifies as fake news if it requires a correction . such an overly broad definition unfairly attaches to the kinds of mistakes that inevitably appear in good-faith journalism . trump seemed to endorse this definition on wednesday when he tweeted a link to a federalist article that purports to identify 16 fake news stories . " the washington post notes that trump 's travel ban for keeping his mother , who lied in an interview about the date of his mother 's death , reports cnn . " trump 100 % photoshopped his hand bigger , " trump tweeted . " there was no reporting to back up the claim . " he added , " i see being called ‘ fake news ’ as the equivalent of calling an italian any of the ugly that people have for that ethnicity.that ’ s what fake news is to a journalist . it is an ugly white house pool report that originated with time writer zeke miller , who emailed fellow journalists on the night of trump 's inauguration to say that a bust of martin luther king jr. was no longer on display in the oval office .
