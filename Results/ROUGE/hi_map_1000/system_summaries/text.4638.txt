" hillary clinton , who officially announced her candidacy in a video released at noon as she herself flies high above the nation in a chartered plane , says she was " a bit larger and growing at a faster rate . " " the 2016 campaign is starting on level ground , " he writes . " i ’ ll return to this point shortly . her leakers say she ’ ll avoid big events , rallies , stadiums , that sort of thing . this is about 2008 , when she and her tone-deaf team seemed to be planning a coronation . this time they say she doesn ’ t been a lot of cases that precisely meet the circumstances voters will face next year : barack obama , assuming he serves out the rest of his term , will become just the fifth president limited by the 22nd amendment from seeking an additional term in office . still , the evidence we have from presidential elections and from other contexts like gubernatorial elections is that these cases default to people who look just like her : educated , prosperous and privileged . needing desperately to connect with the broader public , she opts for the virtual reality of a pre-taped video delivered via social media . go figure . running for president is different . so are the times . voters are more desperate now , and in a far worse mood . if you invite their questions , you ’ d better have some answers .
