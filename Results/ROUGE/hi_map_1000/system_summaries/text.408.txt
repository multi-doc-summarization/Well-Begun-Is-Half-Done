it 's a good time : the rabbits are the prolific progeny of a few european hares that escaped from the island county fairgrounds decades ago , reports the washington post . " every day there are new holes , and the ones we 've filled in are dug out , again , " miller said . " they are cute , but they have an impact on our community , " he says . " i don ’ t think we ’ re going to get into the business of trapping and euthanizing rabbits . " residents have found a safe haven in the city of langley , where some residents feed them and there are buildings under which they can burrow , away from natural predators . " everybody is saying we 've never seen it like this before , " says brian miller , facilities director for the south whidbey school district . " it ’ s a waste of money . they come in and eat everything right to the ground. . " she adds that the city will not hire a trapper or authorize the slaying of rabbits under mccarthy 's governance .
