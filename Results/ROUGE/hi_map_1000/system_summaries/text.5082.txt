the connecticut supreme court today found that the state can forcibly medicate a man accused of killing a yale doctor . mentally ill doctor lishan wang against his will would violate his constitutional rights to a fair trial and to mental and physical bodily integrity , as well as conflict with a 2003 u.s. supreme court ruling restricting involuntary medication of defendants . wang , a chinese citizen from beijing , is charged with attempted murder on allegations he shot at toor 's pregnant wife , who was n't injured . wang has pleaded not guilty , and he has insisted he is competent and does n't need medication . authorities say the shooting appeared to stem from a 2008 workplace dispute wang had with toor and other doctors when they worked together at kingsbrook jewish medical center in new york city . wang was fired from the medical center that year after a series of confrontations with recommended medications was in a percentage range from the mid-50s to 70 . wang 's decision was put on hold pending the supreme court appeal . a main issue in the appeal was whether prosecutors showed that it was " substantially likely " that forcing medication on wang would restore him to competency . " they just set the bar too low before they can violently restrain a patient , knock him out with a sedative and inject him with medication , " rademacher says . " it 's an extremely serious thing to do and should n't be taken lightly . "
