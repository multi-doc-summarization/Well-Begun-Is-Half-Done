a secret agent doing reconnaissance work in the united states for everyone 's least favorite hermit kingdom , north korea ? judging from a quick glance at the replies on his twitter page , it would appear many think so . the always-outspoken buffalo bills wide receiver ruffled a few feathers in new england on wednesday night when he started talking about north korea 's escalating nuclear threats toward the us states and other world powers . but if kim jong un and his staff are going to listen to anything johnson says , there 's one spot he would n't miss if it was targeted . that place ? foxboro , massachusetts , home of the new england patriots and a location where the bills have n't recorded a victory since november 5 , 2000 . here are johnson 's tweets : north korea tripping fans , understandably , did n't take too kindly to johnson 's remarks . it was n't a very nice thing to say and no one wants to picture gillette stadium as a hole in the ground with kim jong <unk> may have what it takes to make usc relevant â€¢ chris bosh 's home robbed while he 's celebrating his birthday . but given that most american citizens are n't taking north korea very seriously , how can you fault a wide receiver for doing the same thing ?
