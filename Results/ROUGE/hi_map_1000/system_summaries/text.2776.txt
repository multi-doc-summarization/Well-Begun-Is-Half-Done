a british biotechnology company called oxitec has genetically engineered a new breed of olive tree fly that could stop their natural counterparts from ravaging olive trees in spain . the altered flies are implanted with a gene that causes female offspring to die in the larval stage . males will grow old with the gene , and soon wo n't have anyone to mate with . in a controlled experiment conducted by the uk scientists , says to have killed off 96 % of the dengue mosquito , but there are those who believe their method of doing so is dangerous . genewatch uk , a nonprofit dedicated to investigating how genetic science and technology affects everything from food to society in general , is concerned that this method of species control does n't have enough oversight . they believe that the relationships this species of mosquito has with other mosquitoes have been oversimplified , meaning the insects could intermingle and cause other populations to deteriorate . " the new programme is less about 'does this work ? ' , and more about the first operational roll-out of this technology , " parry wrote in an e-mail to mashable . " so with pesticides you need frequent and total access to people â€™ s homes to spray or fog . "
