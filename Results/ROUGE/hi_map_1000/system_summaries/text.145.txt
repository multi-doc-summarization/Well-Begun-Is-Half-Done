the national portrait gallery is unveiling portraits of former president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama . barack obama 's portrait was painted by kehinde wiley , a yale university-trained painter famous for his depiction of african-americans for most former presidents , all of whom have their portraits hanging in the museum . these are perhaps the most anticipated presidential portrait unveilings to date , due in large part to the artists the obamas selected . the former first couple 's official portraits were unveiled at the smithsonian 's national portrait , which is part of the smithsonian group of museums . " i tried to negotiate less gray hair , and kehinde 's artistic integrity would not allow him to do what i asked , " he said , per cnn . " let 's just start by saying , 'wow , ' again , " she said . pointing to her mother , seated in the audience , she added : " i had to explain that i 've got enough political problems without you making me look like napoleon . we 've got to bring it down just a touch . and i know the kind of impact that will have on their lives because i was one of those girls .
