the white house response to the inquiry of an fbi investigation into manafort was known to talk to president trump , reports cnn . it 's not clear whether trump himself was picked up on the surveillance . the fbi then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new fisa warrant that extended at least into early this year . sources say the second warrant was part of the fbi 's efforts to investigate ties between trump campaign associates and suspected russian operatives . such warrants require the approval of top justice department and fbi officials , and the fbi must provide the court with information showing suspicion that the subject of the warrant may be acting as an agent of a foreign power . conversations between lawyers and their clients are normally considered bound by attorney-client privilege , but there are exceptions when lawyers prepare public documents that are filed on behalf of their client . mr. mueller ’ s team also took the unusual step of issuing a subpoena to melissa laurenza , a specialist in lobbying law who formerly represented mr. manafort , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity . donald trump jr. , the president ’ s son , set up the trump tower meeting to receive what he was told would be damaging information about hillary clinton from the election and also has denied participating in any russian efforts .
