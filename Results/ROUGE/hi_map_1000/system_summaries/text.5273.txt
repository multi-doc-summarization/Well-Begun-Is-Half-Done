the fallout of volkswagen ’ s massive emissions scandal earlier this year is not nearly complete . while the auto company already faces rampant distrust and dismal sales , it ’ s also being ordered by federal and state regulators to fix all of its emissions-cheating cars—a huge , expensive task . but dozens of silicon valley leaders—including tesla ceo elon musk , former ebay president jeff skoll , and energy innovation ceo hal harvey—are arguing that it isn ’ t even worth it . " a great sum of money [ will ] be wasted in attempting to fix cars that can not all be fixed , " wrote musk and others wrote in a letter thursday to mary nichols , head of the california air resources board . " in contrast to the punishments and recalls being considered , this proposal would be a real win for california emissions , a big win , and a historic action to help derail climate change. , " he said . " we , the undersigned , instead encourage the carb to show leadership in directing vw to fix diesel cars already on the road in california . "
