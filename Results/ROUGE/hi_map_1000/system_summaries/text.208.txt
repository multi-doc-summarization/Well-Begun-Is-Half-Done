president trump has privately floated the idea of funding construction of a border wall with mexico through the us military budget in conversations with advisers , two sources confirmed to cnn tuesday . trump discussed the idea in a private meeting last week when lawmakers appropriated only $ 1.6 billion for the border wall . he has suggested he would seek that payment in the form of a refund , either through trade negotiations , remittance payments or other means . congressional budgeting is done with very specific instructions for how dollar amounts are spent . any repurposing of funds requires express congressional approval , which trump is unlikely to get . the source noted that additional authorization from congress would likely be necessary if this option was pursued . a senior administration official confirmed the president has floated this idea , along with others , as alternative ways to pay for the wall . " i can ’ t get into the specifics of that at this point , but i can tell you that the continuation of building the wall is ongoing , and we ’ re going to continue moving forward in that process , " sanders told reporters .
