a texas lawyer of fraudulently driving up its settlement costs in the 2010 gulf coast oil spill by claiming to represent tens of thousands of clients who turned out to be “ phantoms. ” in a lawsuit filed in federal court in new orleans , the oil giant , which has been fighting the administration of a settlement with plaintiffs in the courtroom and in the news media , claimed that it relied on watts ’ s representations when it agreed to a $ 2.3 billion portion of its settlement with people and businesses involved with the seafood industry and harmed by the massive contamination . the company said that 24,520 seafood claims were ultimately filed , and of these , fewer than 5,000 were filed on behalf of individuals . under the structure of the fund agreed to by bp and plaintiffs ’ lawyers and approved by the judge , any money not distributed to seafood workers based on their claims would be given out in a second round . bp filed a civil-fraud lawsuit against watts and his firm , san antonio-based watts guerra , and just eight have been found eligible for payment . bp said that it uncovered the alleged watts fraud by checking social security records for his supposed clients . watts had claimed to represent more than 40,000 deckhands who suffered economic injuries from the 2010 spill—more than 76 percent of the individual crew members projected to be potential claimants , bp said .
