chris christie has a message for elementary students who miss school lunches like square pizza and crispy tacos nixed with fruits and vegetables . that 's because christie said he does n't believe the president should have a say in school lunches . those , he told voters in council bluffs , iowa should be up to the parents . " does n't the president of the united states have anything better to do than to worry about what you are having for lunch ? let me tell you this , i do n't care , " christie said monday when 11-year-old jacob royal , who traveled from nebraska to hear christie speak , asked the new jersey governor what he would do to make the lunches better . " using the government to mandate her point of view on what people should be eating every day is none of her business , it just isn â€™ t , " he said . " they were fine when mrs. bush was the first lady , but now that mrs. obama is the us being involved in this . " christie told royal , he does not like the " gluten-free stuff . "
