the university of tokyo and kyoto university said friday they can use the new technology in treating patients born without ears or with small ears , with a clinical study involving humans expected to start in five years . the researchers at the two state-run universities cultured human induced pluripotent stem cells into cartilage cells , which were then made into numerous tiny balls . they filled a plastic tube with the diameter of about 3 millimeters with the balls . using three such tubes , the researchers shaped a human ear and implanted it onto the back of a rat . in about two months , she needed help breathing , eating , drinking and talking . harvard bioscience created the custom scaffold and bioreactor for the experimental procedure . sadly hannah died on july 7 due to complications from a more recent surgery on her esophagus , but no device has been able to make blood vessels in the lab from a patient 's own cells could mean better treatments for cardiovascular disease , kidney disease and diabetes . in 2011 , cornell biological and environmental engineering assistant professor john march began collaborating with pittsburgh-based pediatric surgeon david hackam on a small artificial intestine using collagen and stem cells . then this month a team at massachusetts general hospital found a way to encourage stem-like cells to develop into vascular precursor cells , a key step on the way to becoming blood vessel cells .
