toronto mayor rob ford , right , autographs a bobblehead doll in his likeness tuesday , nov. 12 , 2013 , at city hall in toronto . hundreds of people lined up to be the first to own the bobblehead doll , the ap reports . the first motion , which goes to a vote wednesday , would call the city council 's ability to tackle other challenges . " we really just have to build a box around the mayor so we can get work done , " said councilor john filion , who has introduced one of two motions in the council and his power stems mostly from his ability , as the only councilor elected by citywide vote , to build consensus and set the agenda . that authority , many council members say , has evaporated in the crack scandal . he is an unprecedented effort but in some ways , it may not be a stretch . toronto 's mayor already has limited powers compared to the mayors of many large cities in the united states , the toronto mayor notes . the line included both supporters and opponents of the mayor , who acknowledged last week that he smoked crack . some came from out of town . ford showed up himself to sign some of the dolls and greet supporters .
