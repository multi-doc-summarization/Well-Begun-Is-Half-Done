iran has been unable to verify reports since friday of an explosion early last week at the underground fordow bunker , near the religious city of qom , that some israeli and western media have said caused significant damage . " i deny an explosion at the fordow site , " he said . " any explosion in iran that does n't hurt people but hurts its assets is welcome . " the alleged blast was said to have erupted at 11.30am last monday , reports the ap , which notes that iran 's nuclear site is based on the eve of the israeli election , which is expected to be verified by a single independent source . " they [ tehran ] are more than capable of inventing such a story , although if it 's true , a damaged fordow would definitely benefit israel , " the report says . " israel would do anything within its power to stop the iranian nuclear programme . " iran 's isna news agency quoted the deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organisation , saeed shamseddin bar broudi , as saying late on sunday . iran has accused israel and the united states of trying to sabotage its nuclear program , which the level of enrichment has been a major concern to israeli officials , and prime minister benjamin netanyahu repeatedly has warned about the stockpile to fuel plates for use in the tehran research reactor .
