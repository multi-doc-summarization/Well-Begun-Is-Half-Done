it 's not clear that the water is older than the sun , but it 's a good time . the sun reports that earth 's water is so old bodes well for our hunt for wet environments , reports the new york daily news . " by identifying the ancient heritage of earth ’ s water , we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique , and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water , " tim harries tells the university of exeter 's physics and astronomy department , in england , and an author of the paper , in a statement . " it raises the possibility that some exoplanets could house the right conditions , and water resources , for life to evolve. , " he says . " consequently , scientists announced that there could be up to 11 billion exoplanets — planets outside or solar system . " the sun notes that the sun 's birth but wondered that water accompanied the sun ’ s formation , leaving earth to go it alone in stirring up its own water . to find out if the water from that dust cloud made it to earth , researchers measured the ratio of deuterium , and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did , that are at just the right distance from their stars to have liquid water , and , perhaps , life as well .
