consumer data companies are selling lists of rape victims , seniors with dementia and even those suffering from hiv and aids to marketers , underscoring the need for tighter government regulations , a privacy group told congress wednesday . the world privacy forum uncovered these lists , along with several others , while investigating how data brokers collect and sell consumer information . marketers buy this data so they can target shoppers based on everything from their income to clothing size . other lists the nonprofit found included the home addresses of police officers , a mailing list for domestic violence shelters , and epsilon refused to explain how they collected their data or who they were selling it to , citing confidentiality clauses in their contracts . " we recognize that there are situations in which lists are being used to disparage certain groups , " she said . " that is not something that dma supports . " she added that some names of lists may be misleading as to the information it contains and that most lists typically focus on a person 's likely interests , such as whether someone is a " sports enthusiast " or " avid traveler .
