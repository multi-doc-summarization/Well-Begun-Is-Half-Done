president obama will deliver a crucial speech on the iran nuclear agreement wednesday , arguing that the congressional vote that could block the deal is " the most consequential foreign policy debate since the decision to go to war in iraq , " the white house said . white house aides said obama would " point out that the same people who supported war in the first place. , " obama said . " we are confident that a sizable number of members of congress will put politics aside and focus on what they believe is in the best interest of the united states and our national security , and if they do , a substantial mistake to squander this opportunity " to contain iran 's nuclear program . the framing of that message appears to be a direct appeal to congressional democrats ; while some opposed the iraq war , others came to regret their votes to get the one-thirds vote necessary to sustain a veto . since the iran deal is n't a treaty , it does n't need congressional approval , but can be rejected with a two-thirds vote of both chambers . " anyone who wants a phone call will get one , " one official tells the ap . " the strongest nonproliferation agreement ever negotiated . "
