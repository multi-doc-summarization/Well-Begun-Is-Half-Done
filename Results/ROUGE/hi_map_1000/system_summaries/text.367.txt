dairy farmers in brussels on monday in protest at what they say are excessive milk quotas and prices below the cost of production . hundreds of farmers and tractors took up position in a park near the european commission and a square in front of the parliament in the early afternoon , after blocking traffic along several of brussels ' busiest streets . they then turned their hoses on parliament , a collection of vast marble , glass and steel buildings on a brussels square , and unleashed torrents of black smoke billowing into the sky . they plan to stay put outside parliament until tuesday afternoon . the european milk board , which coordinated the two-day protest , said prices with current quotas were putting small farmers out of business . in belgium , for example , the board said the wholesale price for a litre of milk was erected with what appeared to be a hanging dummy of a farmer . " it 's very simple : you ca n't live off milk anymore , " french farmer leopold gruget tells afp . " if i go on , it 's thanks to european aid ... if they do it [ phase out subsidies ] there will be no more small and medium producers here in five years . "
