the man accused of killing eight people after driving a truck onto a new york bike path is a " soldier of the caliphate , " the group 's weekly al-naba newspaper reported thursday . isis provided no evidence it had knowledge ahead of tuesday 's attack in lower manhattan or was involved in planning . isis did not claim direct responsibility , and so badly wounded , the wonderful people on the west side , was 'their soldier , ' " he tweeted . " based on that , the military has hit isis 'much harder ' over the last two days . they will pay a big price for every attack on us ! " isis just claimed the group claims 60 people were wounded or killed . the attack , allegedly carried out by uzbek national sayfullo saipov , actually killed eight people and wounded 12 others , according to the nypd . the officer likely is not thinking about the ramifications of using deadly force , but cops must make split-second decisions that require them to determine who is a deadly threat and who is not . saipov 's weapons clearly suggested an imminent threat . many officers in similar situations have followed the patrol guide and shot , only to find themselves later charged with using excessive force .
