researchers say the water is stored in the air space between particles of ice , similar to the way that fruit juice stays liquid in a slush drink , the ap reports . the aquifer , which covers an area the size of ireland , could yield important clues to sea level rise . when the summer sun warms the arctic island , a giant water world of stunning blue lakes and streams appears atop the ice . now they 've found a new hiding place . " this throws an additional complexity into the system , " forster told livescience . " we thought we had an understanding of how things work in greenland , but here is this entire storage system of water we did n't realize was there , " said richard forster , lead study author and a glaciologist at the university of utah . the discovery will help scientists better understand the ultimate destination of the water in the reservoir . " it depends on whether it is currently connected to a system that is draining into the ocean or if it is a bit isolated and completely acting as a storage source without a current connection , " he said .
