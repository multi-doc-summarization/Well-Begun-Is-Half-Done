" i 'm going to heaven , i 'll see you there when you come , " mcguire said . he opened and shut his left hand several times before the drugs took effect , appearing to wave to his children . mcguire 's attorneys argued he would experience " agony and terror " as he struggled to breathe , while state attorneys disputed that scenario . a federal judge sided with the state but acknowledged the new method was an experiment .
