president obama 's reelection and inauguration appears to have vanished as increasingly negative views among americans about his stewardship of the economy have forced his public approval rating back down to the 50 percent mark , according to a new washington post-abc news poll . in december , just after he won a second term , obama held an 18-percentage-point advantage over congressional republicans on the question of whom the public trusted more to deal with the economy . now , it â€™ s a far more even split , 44 % to 40 percent , with a slight edge for the president and the government 's ability to provide basic services . most , 68 percent , say they would like the two sides to work together to come up with a deal to stop the cuts . the poll was conducted march 7 to 10 among a random sample of office in january . looking along partisan lines , the slippage since then has been in office since harry s. truman , only george w. bush had a positive rating as low as 50 percent at this stage . obama and bush share another similarity in confidence among groups that he has counted as core supporters .
