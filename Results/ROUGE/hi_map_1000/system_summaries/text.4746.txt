a taxi driver after a pair of terror bombs killed at least 31 people , discovered a bomb-making factory in a brussels neighborhood and a note left in an abandoned computer by a suicide bomber who was deported to the netherlands in july , not belgium . turkey says it warned both belgium and the netherlands that he was a " foreign terrorist fighter . " the official says dutch authorities later allowed him to go free because belgian authorities could not establish any ties to terrorism . the official corrected turkish president recep tayyip erdogan 's account , saying el bakraoui , who was caught in june at the turkish-syrian border , was arrested in the brussels neighborhood of molenbeek . one of the two other men pictured with ibrahim el-bakraoui died in the attack but has not been identified . the other is believed to have survived and is on the run , officials say . authorities say a higher death toll was avoided because the bomb did not go off . it was later detonated by police in a trash can on the same street as the apartment the trio was picked up from earlier that day .
