russia 's track and field athletes will not be able to compete in the rio olympics , the international association of athletics federations announced friday , but individual athletes do have a way forward to compete as a neutral athlete . in a historic decision , the iaaf voted unanimously to extend a ban of the all-russia athletics federation ( araf or rusaf ) that has kept its athletes out of international competition since a world anti-doping agency independent commission report released in november concluded russia was running a state-sponsored case in the court for human rights , the ap reports . " the head coach of the russian athletic team and many of the athletes on that team appear unwilling to acknowledge the nature and extent of the doping problem in russian athletics , and certain athletes and coaches appear willing to ignore the doping rules . a strong and effective anti-doping infrastructure capable of detecting and deterring doping has still not been created. , " he said . " in a system that has so badly failed the athletes in russia , it is extremely difficult to define or have any presumption that athletes are in a safe and secure enough system for us to conclude that they are eligible for international competition. .
