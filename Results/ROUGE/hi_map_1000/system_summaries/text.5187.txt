a french territory has sought independence since 1976 after nearly 40 years , a militant group on the island of corsica says it is abandoning its armed struggle for independence from france . the banned decision by the national liberation front of corsica signals an end to almost 40 years of armed struggle to further its ambitions on the french mediterranean island , the ap reports . the group , a monthly publication that has had contact with the armed group in the past , said that the 14-page communiqué was authentic . " without prior notification and without ambiguity , our organisation has unilaterally decided to start a demilitarisation process and a progressive exit from clandestine activities. , " he said . " the time has come for our organisation to intensify the fight in the public arena. . " in a communiqué issued on wednesday evening , the flnc said : “ the time is the birthplace of napoleon bonaparte , corsica is located in more than 50 bomb explosions in one day , for which flnc claimed responsibility . france 's government launched a ferocious crackdown in corsica after a top french official there was gunned down in 1998 on the street of ajaccio . this spurred a series of nationalist protests , followed by a string of flnc attacks against french targets . a branch of the separatist group announced in 2003 that it had agreed to decommission some of its cache of weapons and explosives , taking a further step towards drawing a line under decades of bloody conflict in spain .
