one of the best things about social media is that it can bring families together even when they ’ re far apart . one grandfather is a shining example of this , as he learned instagram for the sole purpose of drawing pictures for his grandkids who moved away . ji lee , a designer from new york , shared his father ’ s sweet story in a facebook video on monday , reports buzzfeed . " i remembered when i was a kid , my dad used to draw for us . so i thought he could draw again and post it on instagram. , " he said . " on facebook messenger , my mom sends the new story in korean . then my dad sends his drawing . i translate it into english , and my sister , into portuguese. . " lee 's father was completely opposed to the idea at first as he had " never heard of instagram , never used email , not even <unk> . " the grandfather 's instagram page went from 1,000 followers to 32,000 . " there were hundreds of messages saying our story inspired them to speak to their own aging parents to awake their inner passion and talent by teaching them new technologies to express themselves and connect their families , " lee wrote .
