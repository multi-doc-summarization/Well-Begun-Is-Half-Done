" it remains a priority for the government to ensure that law enforcement can obtain crucial digital information to protect national security and public safety , either with cooperation from relevant parties , or through the court system when apple did not respond to ars ' questions as to whether this technique would be disclosed to the court , to apple , or even to the public . apple â€™ s success at accessing data on the iphone also raises some concerns about the security of apple 's devices .
