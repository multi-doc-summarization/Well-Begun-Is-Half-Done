" we believe that this is the right time for bskyb to become a wholly-owned part of news corporation with its greater scale and broader geographic reach , " he said . " however , both parties have agreed to work together to proceed with the regulatory process in order to facilitate a proposed transaction and , accordingly , we 've agreed to enter into a cooperation agreement .
