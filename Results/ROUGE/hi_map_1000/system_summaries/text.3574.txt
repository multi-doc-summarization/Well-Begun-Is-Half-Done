a boy born without ears has had a pair created from his own ribs at london 's great ormond street hospital , reports the bbc . " i 'd like just to look like my friends , " he said . " he had problems at school in that he did n't gel very well in the groups because he looked different to other kids and he only had one or two friends at his previous school . he has now moved to a different school now and they have a deaf unit in every year so they are a little bit more receptive to deafness and to a child looking different . but this will boost his confidence no end , " sorkin says . " it 's been heart-wrenching for us and we 've had the moral dilemma all along of whether it 's right to change the features that kieran was born with . but kieran has talked about having ear surgery ever since the age of six when he saw a tv programme about it . " kieran 's mum , kieran plastic surgeon neil bulstrode stencils the shape of louise sorkin 's ears , says : " i 've always wanted big ears , and now i 'm finally going to have them . "
