scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward , and then those bees spread the learned technique to others . the groundbreaking study is the first to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills , the ap reports . scientists from the queen mary university of london suggest that the “ insects possess the essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission , ” as they wrote in their new paper . it is possible to teach a single bee a new trick , in other words , and a different bee can learn that behavior from her peer . " so there was a challenge for me : could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher ? " he recalls . now , it seems he has succeeded at last . chittka 's team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull the string with their legs and fail at the task if the colored target stimulus is not present . to test this prediction , we challenged bees ( colony 2 ) to access the reward when a string was attached to only a colorless inverted eppendorf cap containing sucrose solution ( materials and methods ) immediately after their initial stepwise training and then again after extensive experience with blue flowers and strings . so chittka and his colleagues set up a low clear plastic table barely tall enough to lay three flat artificial blue flowers underneath . each flower contained a well of sugar water in the center and had a string attached that extended beyond the table 's boundaries .
