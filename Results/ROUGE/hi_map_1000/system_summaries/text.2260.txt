the new york fed has known as early as august 2007 that the setting of global benchmark interest rates was flawed , the ap reports . barclays chairman marcus agius , who chairs the senate banking committee , said on tuesday he was concerned by the allegations of the fed is likely to raise questions about whether it and other authorities took enough action to address concerns they had about the way libor rates were set , or whether their struggle to keep the banking system afloat through the financial crisis meant the issue took a backseat . " in the context of our market monitoring following the onset of the financial <unk> in late 2007 , involving thousands of calls and emails with market participants over a period of many months , we received occasional anecdotal reports from barclays of problems with libor . " the fed statement did not provide the precise timing of the communication with the british authorities . bear stearns collapsed in early march 2008 and was then acquired by jpmorgan . " obviously they considered this to be within their orbit , " he said . " we subsequently shared our analysis and suggestions for reform of libor with the relevant authorities in the uk . " johnson also said the committee planned to ask treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke about the allegations at hearings later this month . barclays last month agreed to pay $ 453 million to british and u.s. authorities to settle allegations that it manipulated libor , a series of rates set daily by a group of international banks in london across various currencies .
