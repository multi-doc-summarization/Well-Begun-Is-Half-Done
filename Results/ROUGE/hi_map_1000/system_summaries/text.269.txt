a woman stripped of her miss delaware title last month for being too old is suing state pageant officials and the miss america organization . in a lawsuit filed tuesday , amanda longacre is seeking to be reinstated as miss delaware and to be allowed to compete in pageants before being told they were too old . officials say miss america pageant rules require contestants went public with her highly emotional account , first in an interview with the news journal and then on televised " today " show , that soucek said she would get the $ 9,000 scholarship she earned with the state title . until that time , according to the lawsuit , the only thing the organization had offered longacre was the " wine and cheese pajama party . " " it is a lawsuit without merit and we will vigorously defend it , " said the miss delaware scholarship organization spokeswoman carolyn nelson said wednesday night that the group would have no comment on the lawsuit . the lawsuit seeks $ 3 million in damages â€“ $ 2.5 million for the class of contestants certified to compete then disqualified , then disqualify them . the suit details more than 20 appearances longacre made , cites her additional fundraising for the organization and the facts that she suspended work on her master 's degree in social work at university of pennsylvania for a year , cut her to the national contest that gives each contestant a $ 3,000 scholarship for participating and the chance to win a lot more .
