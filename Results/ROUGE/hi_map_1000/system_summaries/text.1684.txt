a species of snake that had been " lost " for almost 80 years has been rediscovered in mexico , a us museum says . the clarion nightsnake was found on the pacific island of clarion in mexico by a researcher from the smithsonian institution in washington dc . the snake species is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team 's efforts . it is now recognised as a full species . " the rediscovery nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in , " mulcahy said in a museum statement . " proper identification is the first step toward conserving this snake , and we plan to continue monitoring this species to learn more about the role it plays in the delicate clarion island ecosystem . " patricia escalante failed to find more nightsnakes , and no further sightings were reported over the years from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea . the national museum of natural history said mulcahy " uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record , and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error .
