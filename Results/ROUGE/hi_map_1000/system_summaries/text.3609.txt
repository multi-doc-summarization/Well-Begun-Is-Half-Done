about $ 20 million found under a mattress in a massachusetts apartment had been seized after a brazilian man was arrested for laundering money linked to a multi-billion-dollar global fraud . federal prosecutors in boston charged cleber rene rizerio rocha , 28 , was charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and was held after an appearance in federal court thursday pending a detention hearing scheduled for next week . his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment . the arrest stemmed from an investigation into telexfree , a marlborough , massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by james merrill , a u.s. citizen , and carlos wanzeler , a brazilian . prosecutors say telexfree was a massive pyramid scheme , making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “ promoters ” and post ads online for it . telexfree filed for bankruptcy in 2014 , its assets frozen , and its two principals were indicted on federal charges of wire fraud and conspiracy . they were paid with money from new recruits , often friends and family of earlier investors .
