taylor swift 's social media accounts were hijacked on tuesday , jan. 27 , by so-called elite hackers who threatened to release nude photos of the pop superstar in exchange for bitcoins . swift , however , retorted that there were no naked pics and told the offenders to " have fun " finding any . the same group apparently took down the entire playstation and xbox live gaming networks . " i was really shocked to hear you say that you 'd been bullied because of your name because the first thing i thought when i saw it was 'woah , caillou is such a cool name , ' " she wrote . " honestly . i thought it was so cool because it 's different , and herein lies our issue : you will always be criticized and teased and bullied for things that make you different , but usually those things will be what set you apart . " she added , " no one gets to have a place in your mind if they were n't invited there by you . so please do me this one favor : do n't let their ugly words into your beautiful mind . "
