google is encouraging anyone running it operations to ask it for the time . the company will let anyone use its ntp ( network time protocol , a move to help it shops cope with the next “ leap second , ” which will be tacked onto 2016 just after midnight on dec. 31 . leap seconds help to keep clocks aligned with earth ’ s rotation , which can vary due to geologic and even weather conditions . but an extra second can wreak havoc with applications and services that depend on systems being tightly synchronized . the first is that the duration of the atomic second was measured and defined by comparing cesium clocks to the mean solar second , it is likely that leap seconds would have been required much less frequently . the second reason for leap seconds is to add an unusual 23:59:60 , but it ’ s not clear that the year 's rotation is not constant . " this is a particular problem for companies like google , which is irregular and determined by earth 's rotation , with utc which is extremely stable and has been determined by atomic clocks since 1967 , " the paris observatory said in a blog post . " we had one back in the summer of 2015 , and when everybody is ready for one , you hardly even notice that anything has happened . but these leap seconds do pose unique problems for timekeeping computers , which are unable to conceive of a 61st second by the very nature of their coding . in a way , it 's a y2k-esque problem . simple math for a human , borderline brain-frying for a computer .
