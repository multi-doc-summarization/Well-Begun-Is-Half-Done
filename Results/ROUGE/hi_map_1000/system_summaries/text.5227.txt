southern chinese authorities have given in to demands of protesting villagers after a nearly two-week standoff with police , releasing detainees and returning some confiscated land to farmers in a rare compromise . protest leader yang semao says a senior provincial official told him and another village representative in a meeting wednesday that four villagers being held by police would be released over the next few days and land from one development project would be returned to the villagers . yang says police on tuesday night withdrew and removed the roadblocks that they had set up leading into the village . wukan villagers angered by the sale of farmland without their consent drove out local officials and police almost two weeks ago . they also want an investigation into the death of xue jinbo , who died on 11 december while in the hands of local police . police say he died of a " sudden illness " , but his family say he was beaten to death . the villagers had agreed to release three other village leaders detained at the same time as mr xue , and to release mr xue 's body . " i 'm very satisfied with the outcome of the meeting , " villagers have told the bbc they will return to the streets if promises are not kept . they later held a meeting to discuss the developments . there are thousands of protests over land grabs in china each year but the situation in wukan has attracted considerable attention because of its scale .
