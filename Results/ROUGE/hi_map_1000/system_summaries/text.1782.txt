scientists believe they have discovered the first examples of air pollution traveling through the lungs of pregnant women and into their placentas , potentially reaching their fetuses . the study , presented at the european respiratory society international congress in paris , examined the placentas of five pregnant women in the united kingdom and found that sooty particles had made their way into their <unk> . " we do not know whether the particles we found could also move across into the fetus , but our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible , " dr. norrice liu , a pediatrician and clinical research fellow at queen mary university in london who led the research , said in a statement . " it is always good if possible to take less polluted routes if you are pregnant . i avoid busy roads when i walk to the station. . until now , there has been very little evidence that inhaled particles get into the baby 's body to have an adverse effect , because if they have an effect on the placenta , this will have a direct impact on the fetus . " scientists say it is a massive association between air pollution a mother breathes in and the effect it has on the foetus , reports cnn .
