an ancient tomb in northwest spain was best summed up by an archaeologist in one perfect , if unintended , pun it . " no one told me , neither heritage nor the environmental group , " he tells the spanish huffington post . " the site was n't even marked , and the logical thing would have been for them to get in contact with the local council so that we could have taken measures to protect the site . " he added , " i am sure that such disasters happen in many other countries , but have not been published . " npr notes that the tomb is believed to be more than 6,000 years old , from the area 's ancient celtic settlers . " an investigation into how the tomb came to be destroyed is underway , according to the local , but it appears to be an open and shut case : officials simply were n't aware the site existed ' not even the town 's mayor , jos√© luis valladores , " the archaeologist says . " all authorities , national , state and local work effectively preserving our heritage . but sometimes accidents happen . "
