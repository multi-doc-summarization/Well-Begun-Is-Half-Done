a woman who died in an irish hospital from blood poisoning nearly a week after being refused a termination , the ap reports . the death highlighted ireland 's failure for two decades to draft abortion legislation in support of a 1992 supreme court judgment ruling that life-saving abortions , the privately devout catholic prime minister eventually won the vote after a marathon two-day debate in the d√°il . members voted by 127 to 31 to legalise abortion in cases of medical emergencies as well as the risk of suicide . kenny , meanwhile , expelled five of his 74 lawmakers from fine gael 's parliamentary group for voting against the bill and said they could n't seek re-election as fine gael candidates . strong support for the bill came from left-wing politicians , including kenny 's coalition partners in the labour party , who favor much easier access to abortion . many lawmakers in the round-the-clock debate expressed hopes , or fears , that passage of the bill would put ireland on a slippery slope to granting wider abortion rights , as has already happened in the rest of europe . the island of malta is the only other european union member from power for violating its 2011 campaign pledge not to legislate on abortion .
