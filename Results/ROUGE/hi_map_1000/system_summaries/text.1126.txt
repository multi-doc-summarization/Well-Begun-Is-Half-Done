airbus group plans to test a prototype for a self-piloted flying car as a way of avoiding gridlock on city roads by the end of the year , the aerospace group 's chief executive said on monday . airbus last year formed a division called urban air mobility that is exploring concepts such as a vehicle to transport individuals or a helicopter-style vehicle that can carry multiple riders . the aim would be for people to book the vehicle using an app , similar to car-sharing schemes . " one hundred years ago , urban transport went underground , now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground , " airbus ceo tom enders told the dld digital tech conference in munich , per the ap . " with flying , you do n't need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads , " he said . " we are in an experimentation phase , we take this development very seriously . " he says that airbus recognized such technologies would have to be clean to avoid further polluting congested cities . it 's unclear if airbus plans to make the most of new technologies such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence , to usher in what amounts to an era of flying cars .
