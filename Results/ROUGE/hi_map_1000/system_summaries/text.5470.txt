the us government on monday proposed removing most of the world 's humpback whale population from the federal endangered species list , saying they have rebounded after 45 years of protections . national oceanic and atmospheric administration fisheries wants to reclassify humpbacks into 14 distinct populations , and remove 10 of those from the list . " as we learn more about the species , and realize the populations are largely independent of each other , managing them separately allows us to focus protection on the animals that need it the most , " eileen program director for the international fund for animal welfare tells the ap . " this is good news for whales and whale conservation and should be cause for celebration , not a reason to run screaming from the room . " the proposal is likely to face opposition from conservationists . the proposal , which weigh 25 to 40 tons and can grow up to 60 feet long , have rebounded in the north pacific since the listing , which requires federal approval for federally funded or authorized activities that could harm whales or their habitat . last year , the state of alaska filed a petition to remove some north pacific humpback whales from protection under the endangered species act . that population , estimated at more than 5,800 , feeds in alaska in the summer and breeds in hawaii in winter . environmental groups have said north pacific whales continue to be vulnerable to factors including increased shipping , climate change and ocean acidification , which affects the prey stock .
