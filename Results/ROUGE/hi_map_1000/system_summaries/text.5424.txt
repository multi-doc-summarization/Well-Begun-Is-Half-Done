" obviously this package is not going to solve climate change by itself , but it is a good step forward , " said chris huhne , energy and climate change secretary who has led the uk 's negotiating team . " this is a significant turning point , " says christiana figueres . " it 's a good deal which gives a new sense of momentum to [ climate change ] discussions . there was nothing inevitable about this package . "
