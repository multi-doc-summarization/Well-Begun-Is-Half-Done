yazidi women who fled the violence in the northern iraqi town of sinjar sit tuesday at a school where they are taking shelter , in the city of dohuk in iraq 's semi-autonomous and are now surrounded , according to witnesses and the united nations , after the sunni militants inflicted a humiliating defeat on kurdish forces who had held towns in the area for years . the islamic state captured three towns and a fifth oil field and reached iraq 's biggest dam , consolidating gains made after a lightning sweep through the north in june which poses the biggest threat to iraq since the fall of saddam hussein . " the innocent people of sinjar were slaughtered . men were killed and women have been taken as slaves by islamic state fighters , " says marzio babille , a member of parliament from the yazidi community , bursting into tears . " there are children dying on the mountain , on the roads , " he said . " it â€™ s a disaster , a total disaster. . most of those who fled sinjar are from the minority yazidi sect , which melds parts of ancient zoroastrianism with christianity and islam . they are considered by the al-qaeda-inspired islamic state to be devil worshippers .
