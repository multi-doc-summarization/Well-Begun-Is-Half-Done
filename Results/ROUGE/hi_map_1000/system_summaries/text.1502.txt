chicago 's move to extend its taxing power to internet streaming services like netflix and spotify has been challenged in court by a group that argues the city did n't have the authority to create what amounts to new taxes . in a lawsuit filed this week in cook county circuit court , the nonprofit liberty justice center says the city was extending the 9 percent amusement tax to include paid subscriptions for streamed digital music , rental movies , tv shows and games , and also extending the personal property lease transaction tax to professional services like electronic property databases used by real estate agents . " the comptroller has exceeded his authority under the ordinance by issuing a rule that imposes a new tax that the city council did not authorize in enacting the amusement tax , " the suit reads . " if the city wants to tax internet-based streaming media services , then it should put the measure through the political process , and let chicagoans have their voices heard through the democratic process . " it 's not clear whether chicago 's tax is illegal because it treats streaming differently from dvd-by-mail services and also imposes a higher rate than various live forms of entertainment .
