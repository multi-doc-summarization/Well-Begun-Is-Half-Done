two pilots in a helium-filled balloon on a record-setting journey across the pacific ocean from japan surpassed a distance record on thursday for gas-filled balloon travel and are heading toward a landing in mexico 's baja california in two days , officials say . balloon pilots troy bradley , an american , and leonid tiukhtyaev , a russian , who are collectively dubbed " two eagles " had traveled more than 5,260 miles in 1978 . the balloon , which relies solely on an enclosed chamber of helium gas for lift , is different from hot air and lighter-than-air gas . roziere balloons have by far the greatest range of the three types , the ap reports . the pilots are on track to land in baja california , where volunteer chase crews were being organized to help with the landing . " we 're really excited and just now concentrating on getting them to a nice safe landing , " lloyd said , per the ap . the hi-tech team originally planned to cross into north america in canada but shifted the plans because of changing weather . they are now catching a wind pattern that will take them south toward mexico .
