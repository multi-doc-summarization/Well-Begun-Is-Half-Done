british antarctic survey is trying to reach a newly revealed ecosystem that had been hidden for 120,000 years below the larsen c ice shelf on the antarctic peninsula , the ap reports . the 1 trillion-ton iceberg , known as a-68 , was twice of the volume of lake erie when it broke off . the scientists will travel by ship to collect animal and plant samples from the newly exposed seabed , which covers an area of around 2,200 square miles . they will be in the area about three weeks . " the calving of a-68 provides us with a unique opportunity to study marine life as it responds to a dramatic environmental change , " she said . " it ’ s important we get there quickly before the undersea environment changes as sunlight enters the water and new species begin to colonize , " he says . " we need to be bold on this one . larsen c is a long way south and there ’ s lots of sea ice in the <unk> , but this is important science , so we will try our best to get the team where they need to colonize and accessible for the first time in more than 120,000 years .
