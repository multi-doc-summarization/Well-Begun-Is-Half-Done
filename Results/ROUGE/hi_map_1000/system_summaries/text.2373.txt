the baby boy abandoned in a south meriden parking lot on jan. 2 , 1988 , reports the bbc . " the child was found on the ground near a tree , wrapped in a blanket on the morning of january 2 , " retired detective sergeant keith mccurdy says . " why would a woman do that ? " kosienski says he was interested in the safe haven law that was passed in connecticut in 2000 . mothers can voluntarily drop off infants under 30 days old at a hospital with no requirement to identify themselves . " it shows our commitment to the baby and to the children that we represent every day in the community , " says a man attended the memorial service and said he was found frozen to death . " he later found out the mother carried the baby to full term , and he had blonde hair and blue eyes , " he said , per nbc news . the baby was named david paul , which means “ god ’ s beloved little man ” in scripture , and was officially adopted by the city police department . barnes says he would have gladly adopted him into his family . police never found his mother , never identified him , and never charged anyone in his death . but every year since 1988 , they 've come here to pay their respects and remember .
