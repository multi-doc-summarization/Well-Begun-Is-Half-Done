woody allen has been pilloried of late across the internet , over allegations that 21 years ago , reports the new york times . " my mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister , " he said . " i see myself allergic to gossip and tabloids , and go out of my way to avoid them . so when a celebrity is being devoured by the two-headed piranha of gossip and innuendo , i usually have minimal understanding of what they did , or were alleged to have done . woody allen is an exception . i produced and directed the two-part pbs special , woody allen : a documentary , that premiered in the court of public opinion , but she does not . the damnably difficult thing about all of this , of course , is that you can â€™ t presume that both are innocent at the same time . one of them must be saying something that is not true . but if you are a woman who has accused a great film director of molesting you when you were seven , the starting point is the presumption that , without real evidence , you are saying that he is on trial , not her : he is living in hiding , under an assumed name . and when she is silent , the daily beast does not rise to her defense . in a rape culture , there is no burden on us to presume that she is not a liar , no necessary imperative to treat her like a person whose account of herself can be taken seriously .
