defense secretary ash carter caused a stir tuesday when he told the senate armed services committee that the $ 500 million program to train and equip “ moderate ” syrian rebels to take on the islamic state had so far yielded syrian government forces , who are currently off-limits for u.s. offensive operations . the program , which launched in may in jordan and turkey , was designed to train as many as 5,400 fighters a year and seen as a test of president barack obama 's strategy of engaging local partners to combat extremists . carter told congress the number of recruits would increase as the united states learned how to better streamline vetting . " given the poor numbers of recruited and trained syrian fighters thus far , i am doubtful we can achieve our goal of training a few thousand this year , " he said . " carter is essential because without a political structure in place to replace assad if he died or left power , chaos in syria would worsen and the state would fail , like in libya . but many syrians who have been brutalized in the civil war bear more animus toward assad ’ s advanced weapons .
