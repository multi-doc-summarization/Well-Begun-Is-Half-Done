a mediterranean diet might be a recipe for a long life because it appears to keep people genetically younger , say us researchers . researchers used data on 4,676 healthy women , part of a larger health study , “ a three-point change in the adherence score is equivalent to 4.5 years of aging , a difference comparable to that between smokers and nonsmokers ” the study notes that the mediterranean diet has been repeatedly linked to health gains , such as cutting the risk of heart disease . researchers measured their telomere lengths with blood tests and followed them for more than 20 years with periodic examinations . the researchers from boston followed the health of nearly 5,000 nurses over more than a decade , reports the british journal . the diet diet was equivalent to an average one and a half years of life . “ based on our data , ” says the lead author , marta crous-bou , a postdoctoral fellow at harvard medical school , and the diet had fewer signs of ageing in their cells . the study , published in the journal bmj , controlled for body mass index , smoking , physical activity , reproductive history and other factors , and found that the higher the score for adherence to the diet , the longer the telomeres . the difference in telomere length for each point on the ends of linear chromosomes that is independent of chronological age . shorter telomeres have been linked with a broad range of age-related diseases , including heart disease , and a variety of cancers .
