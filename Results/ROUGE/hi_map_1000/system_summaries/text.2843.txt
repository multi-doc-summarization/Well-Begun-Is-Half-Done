scientists say they are well on the way to resurrecting an ancient species of super-cow revered by the nazis after it went extinct nearly 400 years ago . the auroch roamed the grassy plains of europe for 250,000 years until it died out in poland in 1627 , and adolf hitler 's followers tried to breed a similar beast as part of their aryan mythology . " we thought we needed a grazer that is fully self-sufficient in case of big predators ... and could do the job of grazing big wild areas , " he says , per cnn . " this is a challenging process as they have to adapt to the presence of large packs of wolves . " the theory is now being put to the test , as a " near 100 % substitute " of the first recorded cases of extinction , reports the bbc . " you could see from the first generation that apart from the horn size , there was enough wild in the breed to produce animals far closer to the auroch than we would have expected , " says the ecologist . " what the germans did with their breeding programme was create something truly primeval . "
