the giraffe , the tallest land animal , is now at risk of extinction , biologists say . because the giraffe population has shrunk nearly 40 percent in just 30 years , scientists put it on the official watch list of threatened and endangered species worldwide , calling it " vulnerable . " that 's two steps up the danger ladder from its previous designation of being a species of least concern . in 1985 , there were between 151,000 and 163,000 giraffes but in 2015 the number was down to 97,562 , according to the international union for the conservation of nature ( iucn ) . the iconic animal has declined because of habitat loss , poaching and civil unrest in many parts of africa . some populations are growing , mainly in southern parts of the continent . until now , the conservation status of giraffes was considered of " least concern " by the iucn . the giraffes are war fodder , a large animal , extremely curious that can feed a lot of people dr crop resistance to disease , drought and salinity . the update was released today at the 13th conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity ( iucn cop13 ) , restricted to the north-eastern group of biologists that put the first assessments of wild oats , barley , mango and ecology , use and/or trade , threats , and conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation decisions .
