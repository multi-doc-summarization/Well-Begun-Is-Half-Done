french air strikes forced islamist guerrillas to flee towns in northern mali and paris secured new international support for military action as the militants struck back , seizing a town in government-controlled territory , though france said the islamists were " in retreat " elsewhere . french officials said diabaly , 400km ( 250 miles ) from the capital , bamako , was taken in a counter-attack . france began a military intervention on friday in an effort to halt islamists who took control of northern mali last year and were advancing towards bamako . the un security council has convened to discuss mali at france 's request , the ap reports . " they took diabaly after fierce fighting and resistance from the malian army that was not able to hold them off at that moment , " he said . " about five [ rebel ] vehicles entered the town , " one resident tells the bbc . " the mujahideen of mali would have fallen into the hands of militants within days . then on sunday , french warplanes went on the offensive , going after training camps , depots and libya , the obama administration has rejected such strikes in favor of a more cautious , step-back strategy : helping african nations repel and contain the threat on their own . over the last four years , the united states has spent between $ 520 million and $ 600 million in a sweeping effort to combat islamist militancy in the region without fighting the kind of wars it has waged in the middle east .
