a blood test that screens for alzheimer 's in blood samples from six people with the disease , thomas kodadek of the scripps research institute in jupiter , florida , wrote on thursday in the journal cell . the approach may work in other diseases , like cancer , kodadek said in a telephone interview . " it 's unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get alzheimer 's if they ca n't do anything about it , " he said . " the big advance from what people have been doing before is that this method completely removes the requirement of knowing the native antigens that triggered the immune response . " researchers say that the test is still in its infancy , being able to detect alzheimer 's via antibodies would be a simpler and less invasive method of diagnosing , reports reuters . " we just do n't know what are those first weirdly modified proteins that are unique to the disease process that the immune system 'sees , " says a professor of chemistry and cancer biology at the scripps . the study , funded by the u.s. national institutes of health , is published in the jan. 7 issue of cell . typically , in developing blood tests for diseases , researchers have searched for antigens -- antibodies from all six of the alzheimer 's patients than from either the healthy controls or the parkinson 's patients .
