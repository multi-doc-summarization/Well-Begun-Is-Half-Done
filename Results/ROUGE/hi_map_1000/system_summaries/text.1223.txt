" as someone who ’ s been called a socialist who wasn ’ t born in this country , who is destroying america and taking away its freedoms because i passed a health care bill , i ’ m all for lowering the rhetoric , " obama said . " the fact is it demonstrates the deep divide that he is unwilling to negotiate without going after the other side , the whole day was about going after republicans and talking about how unreasonable they are. .
