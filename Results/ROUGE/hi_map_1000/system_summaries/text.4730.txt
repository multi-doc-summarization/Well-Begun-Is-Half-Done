the washington media loves mitch mcconnell as a " tough day " and " weak " at a private dinner with conservative activists on monday evening , reports the new york daily news . " there are still deliberations taking place , and we have until mid january to decide what we are going to do , " the official says . " we haven ’ t given up on changing the american health care system , " he said . " it ’ s been a hard summer for all of us . " mcconnell , twice ousted as a judge on the alabama supreme court for defying federal edicts , has frozen $ 125 million in funding for the united nations relief and works agency , which provides aid to palestinian refugees , according to three western diplomats who were informed of the move . they said the funding , one third of the annual u.s. donations to the agency , was frozen , and is even considering cutting up to $ 180 million , which amounts to half of the u.s. funding to unrwa . trump was trying to play nice with the establishment in hopes they might get their butts in gear on obamacare . but he had no real affinity for luther strange . his race is not over , but the democrats will mount little credible opposition . and when donald trump comes back to campaign for roy moore , moore ’ s base will know trump means it this time . strange ’ s was just going through the motions . it is harder and harder to get honest reporting from dc when it comes to trump .
