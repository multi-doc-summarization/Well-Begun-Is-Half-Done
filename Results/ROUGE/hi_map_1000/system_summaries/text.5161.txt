derrick henry must have heard a lot about his workload , but he does n't think it 's so crazy . " i mean , it 's rare , but i want the ball when i play , and i 'm seeing around the nfl , he â€™ s going to be a little more reliant on scheme and his blocking [ than other backs ] to be at his most effective , " he said . " when you have somebody that 's the leader of the team , that 's something you should respect . " henry 's 339 and his ability to avoid the big hit even though he 's a fun kid to watch the school 's second heisman trophy on saturday night . " people make a big deal about these carries , " henry said , per the new york times . " if you want him to stop on a dime , make guys miss and create on his own if the blocking breaks down , he 's not your guy . " he added , " we can pass the ball too . jake got better week after week . like i said , i just want them to give me the ball and i 'll take it . "
