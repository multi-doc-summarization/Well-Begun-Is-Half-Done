jim carrey has distanced himself from the upcoming universal release " kick-ass 2 " because of its violent content . carrey used his twitter account to pass along the message to the 2010 original i was genuinely excited . like you , i love eternal sunshine , man on the moon and the truman show . carrey is an actor like no other , an unpredictable force of nature who brings a layered warmth and humanity to his work as well as that unstoppable energy he 's always been renowned for . he had lunch with matthew around the time of the first movie and dug it so much he appeared that night on conan o'brien dressed as kick-ass . with graduation looming and uncertain what to do , dave decides to start the world 's first superhero team with mindy . unfortunately , when mindy is busted for sneaking out as hit girl , she 's forced to retire-leaving her to navigate the terrifying world of high-school mean girls on her own . with no one left to turn to , dave joins forces with justice forever , run by a born-again ex-mobster named colonel stars and stripes .
