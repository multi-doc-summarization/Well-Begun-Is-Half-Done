us researchers say wednesday they have found a way to reverse down syndrome in newborn lab mice by injecting an experimental compound that causes the brain to grow normally . while the study in the journal science translational medicine offers no direct link to a treatment for humans , researchers are hopeful it may someday offer a path toward future breakthroughs . there is no cure for down syndrome , which is caused by the presence of an additional chromosome , leading to extra copies of more than 300 genes and causing intellectual disabilities , distinctive facial features and sometimes heart problems and other health effects . the compound also led to unexpected benefits in learning and memory , normally handled by a different part of the brain known as the hippocampus . researchers found that the treated mice were born , scientists injected them with a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist . " most people with down syndrome have a cerebellum that 's about 60 percent of the normal size , " roger reeves , one of the researchers , in a news release . " we treated the down syndrome-like mice with a compound we thought might normalize the cerebellum â€™ s growth , and it worked beautifully . "
