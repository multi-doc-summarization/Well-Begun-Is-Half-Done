boston russian hackers exploited a bug in microsoft windows and other software to spy on computers used by nato , the european union , ukraine and companies in the energy and telecommunications sectors , according to cyber intelligence firm isight partners . isight said it did not know what data had been found by the hackers , though it suspected they were seeking information on the ukraine crisis , as well as diplomatic , energy and telecom issues , based on the targets and the contents of phishing emails used to infect computers with tainted files . the five-year cyber espionage campaign is still going on , but they were unable to remotely confirm specific victims among those systems that had been targeted . still , researchers believe a large percentage of those targeted systems were infected because the malicious software used was very sophisticated , using a nation state because they were engaging in espionage , not cyber crime . for example , in december 2013 , nato was targeted with a malicious document on european diplomacy . several regional governments in the ukraine and an academic working on russian issues in the united states were sent tainted emails that claimed to contain a list of pro-russian extremist activities .
