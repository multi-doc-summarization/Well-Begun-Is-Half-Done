michele bachmann has requested withdrawal of her swiss citizenship after news that she and her children had recently applied for swiss papers caused a stir.referring to the swiss citizenship as an " automatic " designation conferred upon her when she married her husband , marcus bachmann , the son of swiss immigrants , bachmann said in a statement . " i took this action because i want to make it perfectly clear : i was born in america and i am a proud american citizen . i am , and always have been , 100 percent committed to our united states constitution and the united states of america , " bachmann said . " as the daughter of an air force veteran , stepdaughter of an army veteran and sister of a navy veteran , i am proud of my allegiance to the greatest nation the world has ever known . " bachmann 's dfl challenger jim graves called news that bachmann had sought to register her swiss citizen a " distraction . " " today i sent a letter to make clear her way out of the problem ; my guess is that it was n't sufficient for her colleagues and the intelligence agencies , and once again raises questions about her judgement . she was probably just confused and meant to become a citizen of sweden . or swaziland . many people find benefits from dual citizenship and having it does n't make them any less american . it might have given her more access to travel internationally ( if she wished to go someplace that did n't welcome u.s. citizens , but did welcome swiss ) .
