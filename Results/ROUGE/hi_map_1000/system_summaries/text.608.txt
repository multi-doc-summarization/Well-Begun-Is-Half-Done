" he once called donald trump " a con man , " but i think it 's also true because i think our democrat friends are likely to nominate someone who is really out of the mainstream of american thought and will make it easier for a president who 's presiding over a growing economy . " romney , the gop 's failed 2012 presidential nominee from massachusetts , now a republican senate candidate in utah , made the prediction thursday as he welcomed dozens of high-profile business and political leaders to a mountainside retreat in utah thursday night . " i think that not just because of the strong economy and because people are increasingly seeing rising wages , " romney said . " but mitt romney will be re-nominated by my party easily , and i think he â€™ ll be reelected solidly . " he said trump 's political fortunes would be bolstered by a pair of factors : an improving economy and the likelihood that democrats would choose an outside-the-mainstream candidate . " the remarks from romney marked a sharp reversal from his original impression of trump . romney briefly served as the face of the so-called " never trump " movement before the 2016 election . he delivered the remarks on the first day of a three-day , closed-door summit in utah 's mountains .
