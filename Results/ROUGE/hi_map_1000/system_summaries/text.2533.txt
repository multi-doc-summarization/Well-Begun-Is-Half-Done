the transition was designed as a " light sport " aircraft , the smallest kind of private aeroplane under faa classification , with a maximum weight of 1,320lb . but the manufacturers found it impossible to fit the safety features - airbags , crumple zones and roll cage , for instance - that are required for road vehicles into that weight . uniquely , however , the faa has granted the transition an exemption - allowing it to be classified as a light sport aircraft despite being 120lb over the limit . the company says that 70 people have ordered the car , leaving a road vehicle and an air vehicle . passengers travel their full journey , through the air and on the ground without having to switch vehicles along the way . the tf-2 transition can use its front-wheel drive on roads at ordinary highway speeds , with wings folded , at a respectable 30 miles per gallon . once it has a range of 460 miles , and it can carry 450lb . it requires a 1,700-foot ( one-third of a mile ) runway to take off and can fit in a standard garage .
