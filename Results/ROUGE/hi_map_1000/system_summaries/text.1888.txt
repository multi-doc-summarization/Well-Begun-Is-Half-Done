san juan county has become the fifth county in utah to declare a state of emergency in response to the closure of national park areas , the ap reports . the commissioners had decided to take down the barricades at natural bridges national monument as early as thursday morning but put off that move to give utah governor gary herbert time to discuss the issue with interior secretary sally jewell . " we have been advised by the park service ... that it is against the law , " phil lyman , a cpa and county commissioner from monticello , utah , in the southeastern corner of the state . " they have not indicated that they would make arrests or stop people , " he said . " and frankly we ought to be finding solutions to keep them open rather than saying why they have to be closed . " bailey says the costs of the operation have n't been calculated but he said they 're necessary . " how do we let local businesses starve to death ? " bailey said of the county 's plans . " what 's happening to us is wrong . "
