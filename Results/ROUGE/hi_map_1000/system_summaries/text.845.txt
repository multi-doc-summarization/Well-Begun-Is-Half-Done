scientists say a man-made " dead zone " in the gulf of mexico is as big as the state of connecticut but about 800 square miles less than the 2013 dead zone , according to a week-long survey released monday . the finding , by a team of scientists led by louisiana universities marine consortium director nancy rabalais , is within the range estimated in late june by scientists who based their prediction on measurements of the amount of nutrients carried in may by the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers . the primary cause of the annual phenomenon is excess nutrient runoff from farms along the mississippi river , which empties into the gulf , said gene turner , a researcher at louisiana state university 's coastal ecology institute . the nutrients feed algae growth , which consumes oxygen when it works its way to the gulf bottom , he said . " it 's a poster child for how we are using and abusing our natural resources , " turner says . " the high phytoplankton biomass and large area of fresher water would have eventually led to more bottom-water hypoxia . " researchers say the gulf dead zone is the second largest in the world but still smaller than in previous years , is so named because it contains no oxygen , or too little , at the gulf floor to support bottom-dwelling fish and shrimp .
