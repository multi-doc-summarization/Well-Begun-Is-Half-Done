senior vice president of amazon devices dave limp said " alexa , one potato " to the microwave , and it set a timer and turned on . he then told alexa to stop the microwave . the nice thing about telling alexa to cook your food is you wo n't have to lift a finger . of course , this is n't the first microwave with alexa voice control features , other companies like ge , whirlpool , kenmore , lg and samsung have either made or are working on appliances with amazon 's cooking skill . but this is the first amazon-branded microwave , meaning it 's hardware from the company itself and offers better integration with alexa . the amazonbasics brand also tends to be cheaper than competitors , giving consumers greater options . the new microwave will be shipping later this year , and you can pre-order alexa to , you know , cook stuff . there are very few buttons on the microwave because all the presets for various food types have been stored in amazon ’ s cloud instead . it is , indeed , a microwave there is an alexa button on the device . is all this worth $ 59.99 ? sure , it ’ s a smart move for amazon , and , more importantly , it sends a signal so that whatever you ’ re about to say will be in the context of controlling the microwave is unclear .
