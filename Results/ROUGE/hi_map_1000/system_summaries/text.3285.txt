former first lady michelle obama made no mention of the man who replaced her husband as president during her first post-white house speaking engagement thursday in orlando and appeared to rule out seeking office in the future . " it ’ s all well and good until you start running , and then the knives come out , " she said . " politics is tough , and it 's hard on a family … i wouldn ’ t ask my children to do this again because , when you run for higher office , it 's good to not have the weight of the world upon your shoulders . " she added , " there 's just so much more we can do outside of the office , because we won ’ t have the burden of political baggage. . " obama says she and her husband are hard at work on plans for the barack obama presidential center , which will be in jackson park on the south side of chicago and hosted by the university of chicago , reflecting on his formative experiences in politics and doling their own front door . " you can imagine our two dogs , bo and sunny , who had never heard a doorbell in their life , " he says . " we ’ re also thinking about what ’ s going to happen in that building , the programming , but for the country and the world . "
