a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold , nasa scientists say . the huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet ’ s surface , as great a portion as the atlantic covers the earth , and was a mile deep in places . in total , the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water , or more than is found in the arctic ocean , the researchers found . unveiled by nasa on thursday , the compelling evidence for the primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of mars as a warm and wet world in its youth , which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere 's vapor . the hydrogen in water , whether it 's on mars or on earth , comes in two varieties : ordinary hydrogen , whose nuclei contain just a proton , and " heavy " hydrogen , also known as deuterium . “ a major question has been how much water did mars actually have when it was young and how did it lose that water ? ”
