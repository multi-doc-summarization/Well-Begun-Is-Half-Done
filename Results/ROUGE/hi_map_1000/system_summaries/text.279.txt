mitch mcconnell is in active negotiation with the white house on a debt ceiling deal , and democrats agreed late saturday night to postpone a partisan-tinged cloture vote to give time for both sides to find a compromise . " there are many elements to be finalized , and there is still a distance to go before any arrangement can be completed , " he said . " we are now fully engaged , the speaker and i , with the one person in america out of 307 million people who can sign a bill into law . i ’ m confident and optimistic that we ’ re going to get an agreement in the very near future and resolve this crisis in the best interests of the american people. . " politico notes that the vote was a pre-emptive vote in the high-stakes political fight as the senate still has n't voted on the measure from senate majority leader harry reid . " default is far less of a possibility now then it was even a day ago , because the leaders are talking and talking in a constructive way. , " reid says . " but i believe we should give everyone as much room as possible to do their work. . "
