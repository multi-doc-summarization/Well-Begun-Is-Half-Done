a giant tortoise that made a break from a japanese zoo has been found safe and sound two weeks after it escaped - her . abu is doing fine and has a healthy appetite after two weeks in the wild , eating pears and watermelon given by zoo staff . " i was relieved that abu was discovered safely , " a zookeeper tells the zoo . " she might have climbed a mountain , making a big detour. . " the zoo had been looking for the escaped abu from aug. 1 , but no solid leads had been reported . as a result , the family from okayama city went to the zoo to report their discovery . regardless , of which version is true , it ’ s clear that abuh didn ’ t stop to sleep at night , or take the time during the day to eat and cool down . so , if we allow for six hours of sleep and about three hours for eating and cooling , that brings her total estimated and potential travel time down to 240 hours . at full travel tilt , that equates in the summer heat , can survive for months without food or water . the maximum speed for giant tortoises on dry land is about 0.17 miles per hour ( .027 km/hr ) , which means the most she could have traveled in the 16 days , or 384 hours , she was missing is about 65 miles . she can travel at a full speed of 1 kph .
