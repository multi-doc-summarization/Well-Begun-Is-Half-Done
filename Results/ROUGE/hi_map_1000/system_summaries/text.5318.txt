president bashar al-assad 's regime alleged use of chemical weapons would factor into his calculation and he warned that the assad should be held accountable . " we know that the syrian regime are the only ones who have the weapons , " biden tells the white house press briefing earlier tuesday . " if you deem that military action in syria is necessary , congress can reconvene at your request . we stand ready to come back into session , consider the facts before us , and share the burden of decisions made regarding u.s. involvement in the quickly escalating syrian conflict . " the administration 's national security team has been in " close consultation " with their foreign counterparts , and the government has repeatedly shelled onto a letter calling on the president to get congress ' authorization before acting militarily . " engaging our military in syria when no direct threat to the united states exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the constitution , " the letter says . " his options are many , and they include a variety of options that are not limited to the use of force . "
