republican senator and presidential maybe-hopeful lindsey graham stopped by the " politics and pies " forum in concord , new hampshire , today , where he announced that if he is elected president in 2016 , his first act will be to deploy the military in washington to force congress to reverse cuts to the defense and intelligence budgets . " due to the large volume of mail i receive , i regret that i were president of the united states : i wouldn ’ t let congress leave town until we fix this . i would literally use the military to force members of congress to not just vote on the bill , " he said . " graham would use his military to keep them in if i had to . we ’ ve reached out to his office and will update if and when we hear back . asked for comment or clarification , graham is basically announcing his plan to stage a coup : he is saying that it 's pretty much impossible to believe that 's what he really is n't very comforting . although i suppose that 's one way to deal with congressional deadlock . there is no universe in which this is remotely legal behavior maybe graham was just joking ( he sounded serious ) or just speaking figuratively to make a point about his determination to restore cut military funding ( okay , but weird way to do it ) . if he was the senate policing itself , and thus did not violate the separation of powers .
