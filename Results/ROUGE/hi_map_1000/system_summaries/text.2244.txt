the new york police department has spent weeks expressing his respect and admiration for the outbreak of two of new york 's finest , mayor de blasio , and his partner , wenjian liu , and the turning of backs . when he spoke at a police graduation ceremony at madison square garden on monday , the officer who killed unarmed staten island man eric garner , uniformed members of the force turned around en masse when de blasio began to deliver his eulogy . " you will confront all manner of problems , " he said . " all of you who are espousing hatred are just as guilty as the perp who pulled the trigger . " " you created them ! " do n't seem to say it , but somebody has to : with these acts of passive-aggressive contempt and self-pity , many new us police officers , led by their union , are squandering to be called " new york . " the post notes that de blasio had a petition to bar the mayor from attending cops ' funerals , but it 's not clear whether it 's a " racist force which needs to be retrained to respect black life , " per the washington post . " i am truly sorry and remorseful for using bad judgment at a time when new york city needed and deserved better , especially from someone who is employed by an agency of the city. , " reischel wrote . " shame on you for propagating a culture of division . "
