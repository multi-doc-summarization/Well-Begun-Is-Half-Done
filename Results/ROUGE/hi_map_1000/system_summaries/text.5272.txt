" the way i like to think of it is : if you pushed them out of a tree , they 'd fall pretty slowly , " turner said . " so this does raise the possibility they could glide or 'fly ' in a primitive sort of way . " ( changyuraptor archaeopteryx , a paleontologist and director of the dinosaur institute at the natural history museum of los angeles county paleontologist luis chiappe , who led the study as a " weird-looking bird , " reports the new york times . " it illustrates a bit more than 4 feet long ( 1.3 meters ) and weighed roughly 9 pounds ( 4 kg ) , " says one of the researchers saying . " if changyuraptor and dinosaurs like it could flap their wings and certainly had large feathered surfaces on both their forelimbs and hind limbs . "
