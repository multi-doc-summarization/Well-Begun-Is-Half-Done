the united states asked poland to rethink plans to enact proposed legislation regulating holocaust speech that has sparked a diplomatic dispute with israel , arguing wednesday that if it passes it could hurt freedom of speech as well as strategic relationships . the measure would next need to be signed into law by the president , who supports it . poland 's conservative ruling law and justice party authored the bill , which calls for up to three years in prison for any intentional attempt to falsely attribute the crimes of nazi germany to the polish state or people . " we are also concerned about the repercussions this draft legislation , if enacted , could have on poland 's strategic interests and relationships in the face of an israeli prime minister who had reached an agreement with his polish counterpart , and had it ignored , " nauert said . " they encourage poland to reevaluate the legislation in light of its potential impact on the principle of free speech and on our ability to be effective partners . " it 's not clear whether the bill is whether it will put it closer to becoming law .
