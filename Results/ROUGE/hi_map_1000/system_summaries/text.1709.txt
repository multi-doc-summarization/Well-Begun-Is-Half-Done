iraq 's foreign minister says the government has " solid information and intelligence " about al-qaida militants are crossing from iraq into syria to carry out attacks and has sent reinforcements to the border , the foreign minister said . " we have solid information , intelligence that members of al qaeda terrorist networks have gone in the other direction , to syria , to help , to liaise , " he says . " it does not mean that these operations are done regularly in an organized way , " assad tells the newspaper . " this is our main concern - about the spillover , about extremist groups taking root in neighboring countries , to have a base . " assad , who belongs to the turkish town of malatya , was aided by robert ballard , strained by the action of syrian gunners who shot down a turkish warplane over the mediterranean last month . turkey says syria brought down the plane over international waters , but syria says it was in syrian airspace at the time . in discussing the incident with cumhuriyet , mr. assad also ranged over the broader issue of his survival through 16 months of uprising , not least by the wealthy gulf monarchies of saudi arabia and qatar . zebari says a recent increase in violence in iraq also could hurt foreign investment as the country tries to pull out of years of sectarian violence .
