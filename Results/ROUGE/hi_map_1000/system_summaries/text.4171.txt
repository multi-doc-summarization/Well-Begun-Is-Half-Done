the dad who wears khaki shorts and stands with his hands on his hips a lot , " obamacare , " in the supreme court in upholding the affordable care act , or " obamacare . " in doing so , he gave a lot of people who do n't pay attention reason to celebrate him on twitter . they 're idiots . it 's easy to like roberts . unlike other members of the conservative wing of the court , he does n't look like his ideology is consuming his flesh from the inside out . the rest of a court that impartially rules on the law and is not—in four cases at easter dinner and does n't even need to overhear all of your conversation before interrupting you to tell you you 're wrong . compared to them , john roberts and family are a carnival cruise ad . ahahaha , glowering , damned—digs his chin further into his neck with every session , his jowls subsiding like a california landslide in agonizing slow motion . right-wing partisans are crying treason ; left-wing partisans saw their predictions of a bitter , party-line defeat undone . roberts was smarter than that . by ruling that the individual mandate was permissible as a tax , he joined the democratic appointees to uphold the commerce clause ( and push back against the necessary-and-proper clause as well ) .
