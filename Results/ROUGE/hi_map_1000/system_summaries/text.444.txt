a crucial stage in the decades-long job of decommissioning japan 's crippled fukushima nuclear plant began tuesday , with operators starting to dismantle their homes , and left a huge area of land unusable for decades . the plant 's operator , the tokyo electric power company , or tepco , installed six 136-foot covers over one of the reactors in october that year to stop radioactive materials escaping . at unit 1 , rubble from the damaged building caused by the hydrogen explosion is still scattered and needs to be removed . cover panels were placed over the rubble to prevent the dispersion of radioactive materials , but dismantling of the panels started in july 2015 to remove the first of these covers , an essential stage before they can extract the 292 spent fuel rods inside . the government plans to revoke evacuation orders for most people forced from their homes by the disaster within two years as part of a plan to cap compensation payouts and speed up reconstruction . inside the plant , tepco has struggled to bring the situation under control and it is estimated removing the melted fuel from the wrecked reactors and cleaning up the site will cost tens of billions of dollars and take decades to complete .
