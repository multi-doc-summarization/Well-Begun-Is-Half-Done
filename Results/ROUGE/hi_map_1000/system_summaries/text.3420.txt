susan carland , wife of the project host waleed aly , has found a way to channel the daily abuse she receives at the hands of twitter trolls . as a muslim woman , people from many different quarters are eager to engage and how to act . they also seem determined to tell me what i believe in order to wedge it with something better , with something good ? " what about for every hate-filled tweet i get , i donate a dollar to unicef ? and that i am planning to take over the nation , one halal meat pie at a time . as i browsed some of their twitter timelines , i noticed just how many of the tweets they sent out were full of rage , scattered at any recipient they could find . it seemed that as people so full of darkness , they could only see darkness in others . susan carland is fighting twitter trolls by donating $ 1 to unicef for each hateful message she receives . " " i started this project on a whimâ€¦ i knew that i was getting a lot of hate on twitter . sometimes i 'm and the faith that defines me - not a perverted caricature of islam that people try to force on me , but one that instructs its followers to take the higher road and be a force for good in the world , not because people necessarily deserve it but because it is simply the right thing to do .
