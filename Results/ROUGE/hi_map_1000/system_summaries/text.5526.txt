the north dakota senate overwhelmingly approved two anti-abortion bills friday , one banning abortions as early as 6 weeks into pregnancy , the ap reports . the legislature , which is dominated by republicans , also passed a second measure that would ban abortions sought because of a genetic abnormality or to select the sex of the child . both bills must be signed by gov . jack dalrymple , a republican , to become law . as of friday afternoon , the governor had not said whether he would do so . no other state has barred abortions because of evidence that a fetus has a genetic defect like down syndrome , which rises in incidence with maternal age , leading many pregnant women to seek tests for the disorder . pennsylvania , oklahoma and arizona have all banned abortions for the purpose of gender selection . if signed , the bills would create some of the toughest abortion laws in the nation . heartbeats of the bill in past hearings have pointed to federal law that protects abortions up to where an unborn child can survive outside the womb , approximately 24 weeks . a federal court earlier this month overturned an idaho law banning abortions after 20 weeks . nearly all of friday â€™ s debate was centered on hb1305 , which passed by a 28-15 vote minutes earlier .
