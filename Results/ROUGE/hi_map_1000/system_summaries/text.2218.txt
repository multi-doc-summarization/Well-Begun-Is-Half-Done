the holy grail is to develop technology that can diagnose hundreds of diseases with a single drop of blood . many people are squeamish about getting their blood drawn by traditional methods , such as inserting and platelet counts , and found a wide range of results between drops that came from the same person , reports the new york times . " these data suggest caution when using measurements from a single blood drop , " researchers write in a recent experiment . " the company is focusing for " lab on a chip " diagnostics that can be done without piercing a vein . " but researchers are finding myriad challenges with relying on the single blood , and in recent months , theranos , a company that hoped to revolutionize the blood-testing industry , has come under fire from federal regulators . theranos 's ceo elizabeth holmes once promised to detect dozens of medical conditions , from high cholesterol to cancer , based on a diagnostics system to produce test results from a blood drop . but unlike theranos , genalyte has generated a number of peer-reviewed studies to validate its approach . the company has been working on a few drops of blood from each individual .
