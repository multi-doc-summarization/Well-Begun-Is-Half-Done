a canadian man punched a cougar in the face to stop it attacking his dog in a wooded area near a fast food store in whitecourt , central alberta . william gibb , 31 , from red deer , alberta , had stopped at a tim hortons outlet , a popular canadian restaurant chain while driving 600-kilometre ( 372-miles ) to grand prairie on monday evening and let his dog out for a walk , before getting sasha into his truck and driving her away for medical attention . he said the police arrived five or 10 minutes later and , after consulting with fish and wildlife officers , killed the cougar because of the risk it could attack another dog or even humans . gibb himself was not seriously injured , although sasha bit him on the hand as he was trying to rescue her . kalis said cougar sightings were not uncommon around whitecourt because the town is surrounded by forests , and the cat disappeared into the bush . " i was surprised to hear that the owner took the quick action and it 's probably what saved the dog 's life in this case , " he said . " and then i reached down for the closest , biggest stick that i could find and i ran back into the trees to go fight the cougar . "
