a mental adventure familiar has been kept secret since 2002 , the new york times reports . the 9/11 attacks , former governor tom kean of new jersey and former representative lee hamilton of indiana , carried out that highly sensitive task with integrity and rigor . now they are weighing in again as the obama administration prepares to make public at least some of the 28 pages from a separate , earlier investigation by a congressional panel that examined possible saudi government involvement in the attacks . the commission found no evidence that mr. thumairy , who returned to saudi arabia in 2003 , assisted two of the hijackers up to an exam . once the exam is done , we gleefully evacuate our brain of all this hard-won learning that ’ s no longer needed . within days , we can barely remember the subject matter , let alone the details . at such moments , it ’ s as if we ’ ve forgotten on purpose . it might then come as a surprise to learn that until recently , there was little scientific evidence that people could have any deliberate influence on their rates of forgetting .
