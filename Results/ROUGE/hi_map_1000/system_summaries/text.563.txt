miley cyrus is reportedly moving out from the psychiatric ward at a southern california hospital , and into what 's being termed a " long-term facility " to receive care for ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues . as we 've been reporting , heather was hospitalized in stable condition just a few days ago after a reported overdose scare ; now , it appears she needs more significant long-term care than what can be given to her at that hospital . " i 'm not trying to be like , go to the club and get a bunch of guys ... what i 'm trying to do that a little more freely and , also , i 've just grown up to be this way too . it 's not like this was me five years ago , " hannah montana tells tmz . " now i 've done that but that 's not my schtick . that â€™ s not what i do to sell records . i feel more comfortable dressing with a little less , which is definitely not sexy , and as you get older i think you grow into that .
