a first-of-its-kind study has been able to correctly predict 80 % of those infants who would later meet criteria for autism at 2 years of age , the ap reports . researchers say they say the brain changes underlying asd begin much earlier , but researchers say that the brains of infants at high risk for autism in the first year of life . " we don ’ t have such a tool yet , but if we did , parents of high-risk infants wouldn ’ t need to wait for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder at two , three or even four years , " annette estes , a co-author on the study and director of the university of north carolina-chapel hill , tells cbs news . " researchers could start developing interventions to prevent these children from falling behind in social and communication skills , " he says . " children typically show symptoms of asd , the risk may be as high as 20 out of every 100 births . most children aren ’ t diagnosed until at least the age of 2 or older . early diagnosis is key , experts say .
