the annual canadian ufo survey was released monday after an increase in reports in 2015 compared to 2014 in canada and manitoba . " overall in canada , there was a slight increase in the number of ufo reports , and it 's at the second highest level of sightings that we 've recorded since we started doing the survey back in the 1980s , " said chris rutkowski , a science writer who compiled this year 's survey . " they saw what they described as a dark triangle that was moving along with the red light in front and a green and another colour on the side . " " we do know that the ufo reports continue to be made in growing numbers every year and this is just indicative that people are paying attention to what is in the sky . they ’ re not just looking down at their cellphones , " he said . " we 're very puzzled because we do n't hear a lot about ufos anymore although the ufo sightings continue to come in … in fact three or four times . " he says it was silent and did n't look like an aircraft to the couple . his group investigated to see if there were any aircraft in the area at the time , but so far , they have n't come up with an explanation for the sighting .
