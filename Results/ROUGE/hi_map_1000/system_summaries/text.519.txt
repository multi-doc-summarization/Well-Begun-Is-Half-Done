president obama 's attendance at an annual summit of southeast asian leaders on tuesday thrust him right in the eye of the region 's most stormy dispute : the long-raging rivalry between china and five neighbors for control of strategic and resource-rich waters in the south china sea . the inability to resolve these territorial conflicts has become a major impediment to the 10-member association of 600 asian nations as it tackles ambitious dreams like a plan to turn the economically vibrant region of 600 million people into an eu-like community by the end of 2015 . neither the u.s. nor china is a member of asean , but each has strong supporters in the group . summit host cambodia , an ally of china , said it was an acrimonious end to a summit in which south east asian countries failed to reach consensus among themselves over how to resolve the various territorial disputes with china . " we do not want to bring the disputes to an occasion like this and we do n't want to give over-emphasis to the territorial disputes and differences , " she said . " there is no reason to risk any potential escalation , particularly when you have two of the world 's largest economies . "
