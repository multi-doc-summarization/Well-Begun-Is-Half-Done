dna linked to dozens of human traits and diseases since 2010 scientists have known that people of eurasian origin have inherited anywhere from 1 to 4 % of their dna from neanderthals . the discovery spawned a number of hypotheses about the effects these genetic variants may have on the physical characteristics or behavior of modern humans , ranging from skin color to heightened allergies to fat metabolism…generating dozens of colorful headlines including " what your neanderthal dna is doing for you , " reports the new york times . " our main finding is that neanderthal dna does influence clinical traits in modern humans : we discovered associations between neanderthal dna and a wide range of traits , including immunological , dermatological , neurological , psychiatric and reproductive diseases , " says john capra , the paper 's first author . " we realized that we could use them to answer important questions about human evolution. . " the study notes that the researchers used a database containing 28,000 patients whose biological samples have been linked to anonymized versions of their electronic health records . the data came from emerge , the study says , and the researchers say it 's not clear if each individual had ever been treated for a specific set of medical conditions , such as heart disease , arthritis or depression . " vanderbilt ’ s biovu and the network of similar databanks from hospitals across the country were built to enable discoveries about the genetic basis of disease , " vanderbilt student corinne simonti tells the guardian . " it could have helped our ancestors cope with new pathogens encountered in new environments by sealing wounds more quickly and preventing pathogens from entering the body . "
