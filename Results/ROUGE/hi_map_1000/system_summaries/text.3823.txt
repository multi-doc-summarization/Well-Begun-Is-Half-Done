the remains of the victims of the malaysia airlines crash arrived in territory held by the ukrainian government on tuesday on their way to the netherlands , after delays and haphazard treatment of the bodies that put pressure on european foreign ministers meeting in brussels to impose tougher economic sanctions on russia . russian ambassador to malaysia , lyudmila vorobyeva " the su-25 fighter jet can gain an altitude of 10km , according to its specification , " lt gen kartopolov explained ( which happens to be the exact altitude at which mh17 was flying ) . " we would like to get an explanation as to why the military jet was flying along a civil aviation corridor at almost the same time and at the same level as a passenger plane , " he wrote . " it 's equipped with air-to-air r-60 missile that can hit a target at a distance up to 12km , up to 5km for sure . " they also claim to have detected an unusual increase in ukrainian radar activity leading up to the incident , and that the airliner came down " within the operating zone " of ukrainian anti-aircraft missile defences . he showed satellite images of a ukrainian base close to donetsk , pointing out that its surface-to-air missile units were missing on the day of the crash . finally , russia categorically denied supplying the rebels with buk surface-to-air missile systems , or indeed any other weaponry . now , firstly , it 's worth saying there is a propaganda war in both directions here , which has been going on for several months , and what both sides are pursuing interests beyond the immediate tragedy of mh17 .
