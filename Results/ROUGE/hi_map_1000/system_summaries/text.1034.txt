iran 's appeals court has agreed to commuted the detention sentences of the two us nationals to release on a total bail of usd 1,000,000 , a statement released by iran 's judiciary said on wednesday.shane michael bauer and joshua felix fattal had earlier been sentenced by branch 15 of tehran 's revolution court to eight years in prison on charges of illegal entry and espionage since they and a companion , sarah shourd , were arrested on the border between iraq and iran while hiking in the mountainous region . shourd , who was freed last year and is engaged to bauer , was on hand in oman to greet the two as they ran down the stairs from the private plane that picked them up in iran and flew them to freedom . " we â€™ re so happy we are free , " said president obama , also in new york for the u.n. session , per the washington post . " today can only be described as the best day of our lives , " the family members said in a joint statement reported by the white house . " two iranian government cars left the prison complex , presumably with the americans inside , shafiei and agosti sped after them . bauer and fattal were convicted of espionage charges in a closed trial last month . they denied being spies , maintaining that if they crossed the iranian border , they did so accidentally while hiking with shourd . ahmadinejad also reportedly paid bail last year to secure the release of shourd .
