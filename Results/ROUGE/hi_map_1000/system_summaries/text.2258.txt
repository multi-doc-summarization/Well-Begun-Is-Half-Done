the muslim brotherhood worked to stretch its case against mubarak and 10 other defendants , including his two sons , his security chief and a close associate of the ousted leader who is now a fugitive . the trial began aug. 3 but has been bogged down in procedural matters , including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge ahmed rifaat be removed . that request alone took a separate court about three months to rule on and was eventually denied . mubarak is charged with complicity in the third round of parliamentary elections today as prosecutors began their case in the trial of former president hosni mubarak and prosecutors asked a court to deliver “ the harshest penalty ” against him . as the polls opened , some analysts suggested that the party founded by the brotherhood , egypt ’ s mainstream islamist group and best-organized political force , could come away with a clean majority of the seats in the full parliament instead of the plurality indicated by previous results . " the third phase will not change much the nature of the upcoming parliament , " nabil abdel fattah , director of the al- ahram center for social and historic studies in cairo , said in a telephone interview . " nothing is impossible but it would be very difficult . "
