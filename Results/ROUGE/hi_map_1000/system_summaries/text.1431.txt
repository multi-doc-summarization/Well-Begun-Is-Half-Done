a woman was arrested saturday after allegedly jumping on stage at a music festival and attacking a legendary musician after he dedicated a song to trayvon martin , according to police and eyewitnesses . the woman , who police identified as 43-year-old dinalynn andrews potter of barstow , apparently yelled , " it 's all your fault " before shoving 73-year-old lester chambers , his family said sunday . " she had a crazed look in her eye , " says kurt kangas , a friend of chambers who ran to his aid . " i went from 1967-1994 before i saw my first royalty check . the music giants i recorded with only paid me for 7 of my albums . i have never seen a penny in royalties from my other 10 albums i recorded . our hit song was licensed to over 100 films , tv and commercials without our permission . one major tv network used our song for a national commercial and my payment was $ 625 dollars . i am the former lead singer of a 60â€²s band . i performed before thousands at atlanta pop 2 , miami pop , newport pop , atlantic pop . i did not squander my money on drugs or a fancy home .
