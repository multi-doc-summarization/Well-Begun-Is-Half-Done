bai yun , the female giant panda at the san diego zoo , underwent a dental procedure wednesday to fix a chipped tooth that could have impaired her ability to eat bamboo , her favorite food . the 23-year-old panda was given anesthesia so that a veterinary team could repair the chipped tooth , a lower canine . a dental composite was then used to fill the damaged tooth . bai yun 's teeth were then cleaned and a few more x-rays were taken . a bad tooth can be hard on any animal . but pandas are particularly vulnerable to damaged or worn down teeth . the problem is that bamboo is chewy and not particularly nutritious . to get enough nutrition , giant pandas need to eat a lot of time chewing and breaking it apart . " the good news is the pulp canal hadn ’ t been compromised , but it ’ s very close to breaking into the pulp , " said meg sutherland-smith , associate director of veterinary services at the zoo . " what we attempted to do was a restorative procedure to cover up the part of the tooth that was chipped to , hopefully , prevent any further chipping or deterioration. . "
