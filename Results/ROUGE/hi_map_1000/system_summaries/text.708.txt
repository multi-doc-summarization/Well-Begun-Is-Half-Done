bitcoin 's price rose above $ 9,000 for the first time in a week on tuesday evening , despite reports that its underlying blockchain contains hundreds of links to child pornography . the reports , based on a paper published by german researchers , points to a potentially serious legal flaw with the blockchain concept . blockchains , which are transaction ledgers that are stored on many computers , are supposed to be immutable , in order to guarantee the integrity of the information they hold . they can theoretically be altered , but only if most of the network ’ s participants agree to use a new version or “ fork ” of the blockchain , rather than the original . this has never happened with bitcoin . however , some blockchains , such as that underpinning the bitcoin ecosystem , can contain all sorts of fragments of information , some of which may be illegal in certain jurisdictions—and if you can ’ t delete that information , everyone with a copy of the ledger could end up in trouble with the law . it was already known that blockchains could seriously clash with european data protection laws .
