president trump said the truth would only come out if lawmakers get access to documents they have been thwarted from obtaining . the times did not name the informant but described the person as an " american academic who teaches in britain " and who made contact with trump foreign policy advisers george papadopoulos and carter page . the alleged informant 's name has been published by conservative media outlets and circulated widely on twitter . earlier friday , apparently responding to previous conservative media reports , trump had tweeted : " reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted , for political purposes , into my campaign for president . it took place very early on , and long before the phony russia hoax became a 'hot ' fake news story . if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign , that is a really big deal , " the president wrote on twitter , per the ap . " if true , all time biggest political scandal ! " he added , " that is as wrong as it gets . " trump 's saturday response shifted from alleging an fbi source was " implanted " into the campaign to suggesting the campaign was " infiltrated . " he maintained any such fbi action was politically motivated . there 's no indication that was the case . papadopoulos ' april 2016 conversation with an australian diplomat indicating the russians had so-called dirt on democratic nominee hillary clinton reportedly started the fbi investigation that has led to special counsel robert mueller 's probe into whether trump campaign officials colluded with the russian government during a kremlin campaign to meddle in the 2016 election .
