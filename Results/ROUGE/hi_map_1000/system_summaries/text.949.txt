" this is great news and a huge deal , " says dusko ilic at king 's college london . " i also have dna from a third lady . but i would n't consider her a third parent , i just have some traits from them and my personality is the same too , " he said . " it ’ s revolutionary. . " the boy 's mother carries genes for leigh syndrome , a donor 's egg with the father 's sperm , and the birth of the child , whose jordanian parents were treated by a us-based team in mexico , should fast-forward progress around the world , say embryologists . the treatment , which seeks to avoid mothers passing defective dna to their offspring , was performed in mexico . the doctors , led by john zhang , designed a new " three-parent " technique . the procedure from the donor 's sperm is discarded , but the one from the mother is inserted in its place . they are the bits that create the energy all of our cells need to work , and keep the body functioning . but they also contain a little bit of dna . alana saarinen is one of only 30 to 50 people in the world who have some mitochondria , and therefore just 37 genes that are passed down to us from our mothers . this is separate from the majority of our dna , which is housed in each cell ’ s nucleus .
