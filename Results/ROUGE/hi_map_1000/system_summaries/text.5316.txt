" tikalsky 's family spoke of a grandfather who never missed a sporting event or confirmation and taught the next generation how to make sauerkraut . from the defendant 's table , russo listened quietly . when it came her turn to speak , she tearfully read a letter she had written to tikalsky , starting with , " dear joe . " she said her heart aches for him and his family every day and that she would trade places with him . " i would wish the way he died might be an example to other drivers to forgo electronics and concentrate on driving . "
