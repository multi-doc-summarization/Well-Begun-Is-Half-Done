beck miller shared a heartfelt message to other parents , urging them to speak more about preventing drowning than topics like organic foods or how long children stare at a screen . " it ’ s been 37 days since i ’ ve held my baby girl . i pray to god no other parent feels this pain . my heart is with you @ nicolehughes8 as we walk this journey together , " she wrote . " i don ’ t know how levi got away from us as we were cleaning up from dinner , or what lured him to go outside alone . i was the one who found him , face down , in the deep end . just moments before this horrific discovery , i split a brownie with him . i still had the other half of the brownie in my mouth when i jumped into the pool to grab my son . mere moments , seconds . we had six physicians on our trip , including my own husband . if levi could have been saved by desperation , skill , and love , he would still be here . yet , how did i not fully realize just how quickly a child can drown ? they initiated cpr immediately , even intubated him before the ambulance arrived . but levi could not be saved , even with this immediate response .
