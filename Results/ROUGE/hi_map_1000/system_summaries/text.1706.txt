a new study that says it 's likely to be married and less likely to grow up with both parents than in liberal ones , the new york times reports . " red families is simply better adapted for creating stable two-parent families in a post-industrialized world , " says a professor at the university of virginia . " it turns out that , on average , more conservative counties across the country have more marriage , less nonmarital childbearing , and marriage that are ill suited to the new economy and the more egalitarian world that we now live in . by contrast , blue america emphasizes education , delayed parenthood , and gender egalitarianism , all values that are supposed to equip its citizens to build comparatively stronger and more stable families in twenty-first-century america . " " the red states , the heartland states , if you will , the states that tout family values or celebrate family values , there are religious and traditional [ values there ] that you [ cahn and carbone ] say increase the likelihood of having less stable families . there is only one problem with the conventional wisdom about family life in red and blue america . it â€™ s mostly happier families , democrats or republicans ?
