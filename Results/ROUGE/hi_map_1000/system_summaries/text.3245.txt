ecuador has been holed up for nearly two months inside the ecuadorean embassy in london in a bid to avoid extradition to sweden on allegations of sexual assault , the ap reports . ecuadorean foreign minister ricardo patino said that assange 's legal and procedural rights had been violated , and that it is obliged to turn assange , 41 , over to authorities in sweden , a fellow member of the european union . for assange himself , the announcement from quito remains only a symbolic victory for the moment . britain has refused to grant him safe passage out of the country ; rather , police say that assange is a mere meeting scheduled for thursday 16th august . given the statements made in quito overnight , about an imminent decision , should we take it this meeting will be the final one to agree a joint text ? " we believe that you are prepared to continue to engage with the ongoing diplomatic discussions . we continue to believe that a solution is possible on the basis of a jointly agreed text , which would accompany mr. assange exiting the embassy , and leading to his extradition . we have a legal duty to extradite mr assange . there is a law that says we have to extradite him to sweden .
