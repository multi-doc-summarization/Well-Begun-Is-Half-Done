the planet is 20 % wider and 80 % more massive than earth , with a density nearly identical to that of our planet , two research teams report in separate papers published online today , reports the journal nature . " this is the planet that , in many respects , is the most like earth that 's been discovered outside our solar system , " says andrew howard , of the university of hawaii at manoa 's institute for astronomy and lead author of one of the studies . " it has approximately the same size . it has the same density , which means it 's made out of the same stuff as earth , in all likelihood . " the planet was found by nasa 's prolific kepler space telescope , which has spotted nearly 3,600 potential exoplanets since its march 2009 launch . kepler 's measurements allow researchers to estimate the planet ’ s size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star . measuring the planet 's mass—and orbit baffles astronomers , is a clue to its composition—is more difficult . planets of size 2–4 have proved to have a wide range of densities , implying a diversity of compositions4,5 , but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as earth .
