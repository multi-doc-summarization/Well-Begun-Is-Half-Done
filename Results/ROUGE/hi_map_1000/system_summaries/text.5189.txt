british singer-songwriter adele has been pining away for a clueless breakup with a former lover , the new york times reports . the new album will simply be too painful for her to perform in the future , the 22-year-old bares her soul in bluesy tunes like 'someone like you ' and 'rolling in the deep . ' watch adele 's follow-up album , 21 , was released yesterday , and it sounds like that whole " chasing " situation did n't end so well . as in , adele got her heart broken , big-time . the very chatty singer has made no secret of the fact that 21 is a breakup album , written entirely about one heartless ex-boyfriend , and that got us thinking : how does adele 's effort stack up against the other great call-out songs in music history ? who else has made it explicitly clear what their ex did that got them called out in song ? no vague " he/she broke my heart " stuff . " the most deserved musical shamings , as explained in the song by the person doing the shaming , rated by the level of revenge achieved . "
