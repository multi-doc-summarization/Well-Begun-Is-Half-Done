portland police chief michael reese just released a statement on the al gore sexual assault allegations against former vice president al gore after finding " procedural " mistakes in how the bureau handled the case in 2009 . the bureau 's command-level supervisors should have reviewed the case and should have made the decision on whether the investigation should move forward when the complainant came to them last year -- the second time she went to police , portland police say . " in reviewing this case , we have determined there were procedural issues with the 2009 investigation that merit re-opening the case , " reese said . " we ask for the public ’ s patience as we let the facts of the investigation . i have asked detectives to assign appropriate resources in the interest of conducting a complete investigation in an expedited manner . " police consulted the district attorney 's office at that time , the police declined to pursue an investigation of the 2006 incident after a 2009 interview with the woman who accused gore of sexual assault , molly hagerty . at the time they cited “ insufficient evidence. ” but now reese appears to be saying that call should have been made at a higher level of the department .
