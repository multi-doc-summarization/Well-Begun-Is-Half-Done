the small southern utah town of hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend . the sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for barista 's restaurant , and owner stephen ward said he woke up friday and decided the bull would look better without the oversized genitalia that caused uproar among the neighbors . hurricane residents disturbed by the noticeable , cone-shaped feature had asked the city council to revoke barista 's business license . ward told the spectrum newspaper in st. george ( http : //bit.ly/1dgosne ) saturday that he made it clear to city officials before he altered the statue that he was n't bowing to community pressure . " i told them i am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints . i do n't know what a weenie on a bull is supposed to look like , " ward said . he said he did n't put it up to make anyone angry on purpose , but the conflict has n't hurt his business . " it did n't even look ( right ) , it was in the shape of a cone , " he said . " but i love the joints and the plate work , you know , instead of that atrocious . it was so stupid because it looks like a party hat . when the well-endowed bull initially went up at barista 's , it prompted fierce backlash from angry residents who called the sign offensive and inappropriate , saying the sign was approved by the city before it went up .
