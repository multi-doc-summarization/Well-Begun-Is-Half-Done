animal trainer peter winney wants to bring six lions and tigers to his girlfriend 's ranch south of elizabeth , but the couple has faced allegations of smuggling cats , according to state wildlife records obtained by the denver post . winney was convicted once for bringing two lion cubs into the state without proper documents and charged two other times with having unlicensed animals . he said the 2003 conviction was a misunderstanding over paperwork , though it cost him his wildlife license for a year . " the flooding and resulting damage prevents us from reasonably continuing our operation and caring for our animals safely , " he said . " at the same time i don ’ t know exactly what kind of problems they are facing down there. ” in a statement to cbs4 , jim hansen has lived near the sanctuary for many years . he was the second time the board of commissioners voted against a move for the facility , with a previous board turning down a similar request by lion ’ s gate in 2006 . for years , neighbors living near the proposed relocation site had said it was not appropriate for a rural neighborhood mostly known for an equine lifestyle .
