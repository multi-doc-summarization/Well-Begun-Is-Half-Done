whoever broke into an ohio museum and stole a solid-gold replica of the apollo 11 mission that 's much larger than other rocks given away or loaned to museums or foreign countries that could easily be smuggled out of the country , where a geologist could verity its authenticity . he said it would be worth millions of dollars to a collector into space items . " either they did n't have easy access to the moon rock , or they were n't into collectibles , " gutheinz said sunday . " they were into turning a quick buck . " the museum responded to the theft on its facebook page : " the truth is that you ca n't steal from a museum . museum 's do n't 'own ' artifacts . we are simply vessels of the public trust . museums care for and exhibit items on behalf of you , the public . three hundred people driving from across the country were robbed of their opportunity to experience the museum today . for every day that an item is missing , we are all robbed of an opportunity to enjoy it and our history .
