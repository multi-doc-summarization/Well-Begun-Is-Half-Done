tesla has filed for a new patent that describes a technology to automate turn signals . surprisingly , it sounds like the technology is actually not for self-driving cars , but for drivers who forget/don â€™ s dangerous . tesla appears to have a solution . " an embodiment includes a method of automated turn signaling , the method comprising : determining , via the processor , that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn based on a measured steering angle value that is within a value range stored in a memory , wherein the car includes the autopilot hardware at its disposal , it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them , but because those ultimately rely on the driver moving their finger and physically activating the signal , they 're not that helpful . people are just lazy , what can we say ? enlarge image tesla anyway , i hope this patent actually makes it into a vehicle , since many patents do n't . they 're most often secured by manufacturers as a means of hampering the competition 's ability to develop a technology but in this case , if it works , it could really do some good . we 've reached out to tesla for additional information on this patent , but it has not immediately responded to requests for comment .
