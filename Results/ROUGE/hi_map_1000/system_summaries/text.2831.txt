the greenland ice sheet has been getting darker over the past two decades , absorbing more heat from the sun and increasing snow melt , a new study led by columbia 's earth institute and published thursday in the cryosphere , a journal of the european geosciences union journal . " what â€™ s new is the acceleration of the darkening , which started in 1996. , " lead author marco tedesco , a research professor at columbia university 's lamont-doherty earth observatory and adjunct scientist at nasa goddard institute of space studies , tells the bbc . " a snowpack that might look 'clean ' to our eyes can be more effective in absorbing solar radiation than a dirty one . " " you do n't necessarily have to have a 'dirtier ' snowpack to make it dark , " he said . " we knew that these processes had been happening . " the study notes that greenland could be ten % darker than it is today , but it 's not clear whether the naked eye will be seen with the surface of the ice sheet . the study says it has been driving the change , the study reports .
