donald trump , whose caustic comments about mexicans have inflamed the immigration debate , told thousands of cheering supporters here saturday that “ we have to take back the heart of our country. ” in a rambling , defiant speech delivered his charge that mexico was sending violent offenders to the u.s. to harm americans and that u.s. officials were being " dumb " in dealing with immigrants in the country illegally . " these people wreak havoc on our population , " he said . " i love 'em . many , many people from mexico are legal . they came in the old-fashioned way . legally . he 's weak on immigration. ” trump 's 70-minute address here , which sounded more like a stream-of-consciousness rant than a presidential-style stump speech , put an exclamation point on his bombastic push since his presidential announcement last month to return immigration to the forefront of the national conversation . republican leaders say they believe the celebrity billionaire has virtually no chance of being their nominee , much less of making it to the white house . and , for now at least , his following seems limited to the far right as opposed to the party 's mainstream . yet trump has reignited a heated debate over an issue , immigration , that the gop had been determined to settle after it hurt republicans in the most recent presidential election . party leaders increasingly fear that trump could do damage to more viable candidates , such as bush , who could lose their own footing on immigration . these candidates confront a familiar challenge : during the primary season , they must deal with the anger and anxiety that many on the right feel about illegal immigration .
