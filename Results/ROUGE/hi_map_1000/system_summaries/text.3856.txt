a man who jumped from a protective fence at the bronx zoo will not be euthanized and " did nothing wrong , " reports the new york daily news . " we were able to prevent a bad situation from turning into a real tragedy , " says a hospital spokeswoman . " you have more to fear from other people than from other animals , " he said . " it 's very hard to stop that . " bashuta was returned to a holding area where it usually sleeps by zoo officials , who used a fire extinguisher to chase the animal away , said zoo director jim breheny . he suffered bites and punctures on his arms , legs , shoulders and back and broke an arm and a leg . " if not for the quick response by our staff and their ability to perform well in emergency situations , the outcome would have been very different , " breheny says , per the press conference . " the man apparently jumped out of his train car with a leap powerful enough to clear the 16-foot-high perimeter fence . " " we did not have to use deadly force but we were prepared to do so . "
