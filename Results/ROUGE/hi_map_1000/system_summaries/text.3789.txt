yahoo 's new chief executive , filed in the u.s. district court in san jose , filed a suit against facebook , alleging that the social-networking service got a " free ride " by violating 10 patents , the ap reports . " we 're disappointed that yahoo , a longtime business partner of facebook and a company that has substantially benefited from its association with facebook , has decided to resort to litigation , " he said . " so that might make facebook more willing to resolve its differences with yahoo . " yahoo has used similar timing to its advantage in the past . google agreed to issue shares to yahoo nine days before google went public in 2004 in exchange for a license to yahoo 's patents . yahoo , one of the web 's pioneering companies , has seen its revenues decline in recent years at a time when rivals such as facebook and google have thrived . " unfortunately , the matter with facebook remains unresolved and we are compelled to seek redress in federal court , " the company said in a statement . " facebook has since grown to go public , the last thing it needs is to get involved in a knock-down , drag out litigation fight . "
