the world 's largest physics lab said thursday they have clocked neutrinos traveling faster than light , a team of physicists in europe reports . the organization , known as cern , hosted part of the experiment , which is unrelated to the massive $ 10 billion large hadron collider also located at the site . gillies told the associated press that the readings have so astounded researchers that they are asking others to independently verify the measurements before claiming an actual discovery . " i suspect that the bulk of the scientific community will not take this as a definitive result unless it can be reproduced by at least one and preferably several experiments , " he said . " we wanted to find a mistake - trivial mistakes , more complicated mistakes , or nasty effects - and we did n't . " when you do n't find anything , then you say 'well , now i 'm forced to go out and ask the community to scrutinise this ' . " they are inviting the broader physics community to look at what they 've done and really scrutinize it in great detail , " says a spokesman for the european organization for nuclear research .
