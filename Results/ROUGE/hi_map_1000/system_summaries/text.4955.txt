the ukrainian government will restart cease-fire negotiations with pro-russian insurgents in the black earth region of eastern ukraine , and the soldiers perching on the motley collection of vehicles clogging the southbound militia from their stronghold of slovyansk . last week , ukrainian president petro poroshenko promised cease-fire talks no later than that saturday , but a series of military successes by the ukrainian army may have changed minds in kiev . instead , on saturday , the mayor of donetsk issued a statement after a meeting with poroshenko , saying the president suggested talks could take place in svyatogorsk , a town in the north of the region . the insurgents would be unlikely to agree to svyatogorsk , which is controlled by kiev . " i do n't think we will go there . it 's not safe , " rebel leader alexander borodai tells interfax news . he said locations acceptable to the rebels include donetsk , russia or belarus . a 10-day cease-fire that ended in late june was punctuated by frequent clashes and provided no progress in reaching a negotiated settlement . more than 400 people have died and thousands have fled their homes after a nearly three-month-long standoff between the rebels and the new authorities in kiev , who came to power after the ex-president 's ouster in february . rebels in ukraine and nationalists in russia have called for the kremlin to protect the insurgents , but russian president vladimir putin has so far made no comment on the rebels ' defeat in slovyansk , while state media and other officials have downplayed the loss .
