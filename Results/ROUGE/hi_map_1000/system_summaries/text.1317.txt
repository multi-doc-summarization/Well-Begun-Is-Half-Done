a california lawmaker introduced legislation that would make providing a straw without being asked punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a fine not to exceed $ 1,000 , under the existing california retail food code . that law states , " except as otherwise provided , a person who violates any provision of the code to be guilty of a misdemeanor with each offense punishable by a fine of not less than $ 25 , or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding 6 months , and not bars and fast-food restaurants , according to the bill . calderon also emphasized the bill is n't a ban on plastic straws . " we need to create awareness around the issue of one-time use plastic straws and its detrimental effects on our landfills , waterways , and oceans , " stated majority leader calderon . " it is a small step towards curbing our reliance on these convenience products , which will hopefully contribute to a change in consumer attitudes and usage. ‚Äù plastic is a material that lasts forever , yet 33 percent of all plastics are recycled , but due to their small size and lack of a resin code , no straws are ever recycled . after their one-time use , non-biodegradable plastic straws often end up in our oceans and waterways where they break down into smaller , micro-size pieces that are discarded into our environment . they are oftentimes mistaken as food by marine life .
