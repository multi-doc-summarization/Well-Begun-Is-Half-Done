paul booth , an honorary senior research fellow in history at keele university , was recently digging around in the chester county court plea rolls from december 8 , 1310—and really , who has n't dug around in there ? that was when he came upon three write-ups from the court clerk , telling the sad story of a guy with the unenviable name of roger fuckebythenavele , or seemingly : " roger the navel-fucker . " the man was being named three times part of a process to be outlawed , with the final mention coming on september 28 , 1311 reports . " it is related to words in several other germanic languages , such as dutch , german , and swedish , that have sexual meanings as well as meaning such as ‘ to strike ’ or ‘ to move back and forth ’ , " he wrote . " this name is presumably a nickname . i suggest it could either mean an actual attempt at copulation by an inexperienced youth , later reported by a rejected girlfriend , but this likely could be just a different spelling for the word ‘ fulcher ' which means soldier . that really would n't count . this , on the other hand , would be the first instance of the word being used the way we use it today , beating out recent discoveries like the one from around 1475 .
