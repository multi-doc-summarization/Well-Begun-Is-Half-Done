astronaut scott kelly , expedition 43 , with carrots the indian and the pacific oceans , has been met with crews died from it ! " it was such a problem that ship owners and governments counted on a 50 percent death rate from scurvy for their sailors on any major voyage , " science journalist catherine price wrote in her book vitamania . " without proper nutrition for the astronauts , the mission will fail . it 's that simple . " smith and his colleagues at nasa 's nutritional voyage around the world may have earned him fame and fortune , but it also resulted in the deaths of 65 % of his crew while crossing the pacific . two voyages made by pedro de quiros early in the 17th century resulted in huge mortality from a sickness sir richard hawkins called , after his venture into the south seas , 'the plague of the sea , and the spoyle of mariners ' . " scurvy starts with lethargy so intense that people once believed laziness was a cause , rather than a symptom , of the disease , " price wrote . " your body feels weak . your arms and legs swell , and your skin bruises at the slightest touch . "
