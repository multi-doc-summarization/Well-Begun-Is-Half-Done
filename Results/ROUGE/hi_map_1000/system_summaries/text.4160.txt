it 's been crazy , but it 's not clear that the pair of the world 's lips on the world ’ s lips after news of middlesbrough lads phillip cooper and his brohams woke up in bangkok , with one shaved head , one facial tattoo and one chain-smoking capuchin monkey . phillip boyle and his friends managed to avoid the worst aspects of that movie , but the part about going out drinking and waking up in thailand ? yeah , they did that . boyle and several friends went out on friday night for a few drinks , picked up a few more drinks at a gas station and then stayed up all night throwing back the finest alcoholic beverages that northern england has to offer . at 11 the next morning , boyle 's friend jamie blyth started asking if he had his passport , then called a cab to take the whole hungover group to the manchester airport . boyle told gazettelive when we got in the taxi we didn ’ t even have flights . " if we were there for a week or so we ’ re here now so we should just make the most of it ' , " he said . " i have fallen behind with a few things at work though . "
