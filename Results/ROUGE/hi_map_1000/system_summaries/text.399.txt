kennedy 's vote is in play on voting district maps in wisconsin , the ap reports . liberal justices expressed openness to the idea that courts should intervene when lawmakers draw election maps that greatly favor their party . conservatives were skeptical that judges could come up with a way to determine whether and when legislators had gone too far . in the middle of it all — as expected — was justice anthony kennedy . both sides see him as the one who will likely cast the deciding vote and they pitched their arguments to him . a three-judge panel last year ruled 2-1 that maps for the wisconsin assembly were so heavily republican that they violated the constitutional rights of democratic voters . now , the supreme court must decide whether the lower court got the ruling right . justice ruth bader ginsburg asked what would happen to the " precious right to vote " with maps like wisconsin 's that lock in a majority for one party . " if you can stack a legislature in this way , what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote ? " she asked . " whether it 's a democratic district or a republican district , the result is preordained in most of the districts . "
