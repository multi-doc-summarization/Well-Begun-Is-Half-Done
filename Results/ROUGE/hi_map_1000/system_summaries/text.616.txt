president obama is " apoplectic " about lavish spending at the gsa , one of his top advisers said sunday . " you know , i 'm not critical of what the administration has done thus far , " said david axelrod . " and i think from this point moving forward , i think it 'd be wise for all republicans to kind of respect that process , myself included , and say moving forward . we 're going to let his process play itself out . he has demonstrated in many ways that he is on top of this , and we 'll get to the bottom of it . my experience with the secret service has been with stellar individuals . " rubio said he 'll no longer discuss the republican vice-presidential process , a slight shift from his staunch stated opposition to the no . 2 post . in an interview aired sunday on cnn ’ s “ state of the union , " he said he 'd like to see jeb bush take the job , if asked . " i ca n't help but wonder if there 'd been more women as part of that detail if this ever would ’ ve happened , " collins said . " we made a big effort to cut waste , inefficiency , fraud against government , saved tens of billions of dollars doing it on just this very kind of thing . and so this was very enraging to him , and , of course , he acted quickly , the administration acted quickly and changed the management there .
