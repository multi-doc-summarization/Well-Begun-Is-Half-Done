the drudge report has become propaganda for donald trump 's sweep of all the delegates from colorado 's republican convention as a corrupt power grab , the ap reports . matt drudge was channeling the phony indignation of his chosen candidate as donald trump spent the evening on twitter and the morning on fox news complaining that while the " drudge report over the years has done a good job highlighting the excesses of the left , " it 's become critical of him recently . " there was no red siren on drudge when we won all 34 delegates in colorado . that wasn ’ t news. , " cruz said . " so every day they have the latest trump attack , they ’ re directed at me . by all appearances , roger stone now decides what ’ s on drudge . and most days , they have six-month-old article that is some attack on me and it ’ s whatever the trump campaign is pushing that day will be the banner headline on drudge , " he says . " when we win the state , suddenly the state doesn ’ t matter . you know colorado , there was some red siren . " cruz 's campaign has basically become the attack site for the donald trump campaign , " by the way , they no longer cover news . "
