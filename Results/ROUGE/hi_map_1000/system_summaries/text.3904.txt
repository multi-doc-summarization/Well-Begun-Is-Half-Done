keith urban is no stranger to sexy selfies—but unlike some stars , he 's only sharing them with wife nicole kidman , the new york daily news reports . " we never text , " nicole kidman tells vanity fair . " and you know , with no disrespect to what i had with tom , i was a child , really , when i got married . and i really did not know if that was going to happen . i wanted it , but i didn ’ t want it for a while , because i can kind of have a very odd , idiosyncratic kind of path . i have stepped away from the fame part of it . so i went , o.k. , this is not for me . and it was such a blessing that i found somebody who said , ‘ well , are you willing to move to tennessee ? ' and ‘ why is that person saying hello to you when you don ’ t know them ? ' all of that stuff has to give up if you want to have a family . you can have a certain career , but you can ’ t be living in hollywood , [ where ] absolutely everything , everything revolves around it . that wasn ’ t my choice . i ’ m sure brad and angelina have that—because there ’ s nobody else that understands it except that person who ’ s sleeping right next to you. .
