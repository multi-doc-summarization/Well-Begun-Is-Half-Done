" our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher than chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women . at the same time , we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess the relationship between measured iq , perceived intelligence , but again , only in men . no relationship between perceived intelligence and iq was found for women . we used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes , a larger nose , a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth , and a sharper and massive chin , " writes <unk> <unk> of charles university in prague and her colleagues wrote in their study . for their study , the researchers found that people who were perceived as more attractive also tended to be perceived as highly intelligent are longer , with a wide distance between measured intelligence and their actual iq . naturally , the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader , more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other , a shorter nose , declining corners , and facial shape .
