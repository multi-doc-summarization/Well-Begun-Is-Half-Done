two nuclear bombs that fell near raleigh , north carolina , and the us air force aircraft went into a tailspin and broke up in the sky of goldsboro , the washington post reports . a disaster worse than a year before they were obtained by the national security archives , reports the bbc . " this bomb had the potential to make the one used in hiroshima look like the work of a cap gun , " says eric schlosser , author of book on " the goldsboro incident . " it 's not clear whether it was dropped over the soviet union at the time . " for weapon 2 , the arm/safe switch was in the “ safe ” position , yet it was virtually armed because the impact shock had rotated the indicator drum to the “ armed ” position . but the shock also damaged the switch contacts , which had to be intact for the weapon to cross , and only a single low-voltage switch prevented the explosion . " the explosive performed just as a nuclear weapon is designed to function in wartime , a few years later , when he observed that , ‘ by the slightest margin of chance , literally the failure of two wires to cross .
