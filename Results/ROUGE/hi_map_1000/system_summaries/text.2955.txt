the new york times reports that the american film industry is advertised a three thousand-year-old legend could use a big , loud , uninvolving mess played by actors who arenít even taking the film seriously it 's in 3-d ! " clash the story and all , but i ’ ve got some notes . first , the hero , he 's all squeaky clean and stuff . folks don ’ t buy that anymore . we need to make him angry at the gods , you know , a pissed-off rebel who wants to do everything on his own . but can you beef up the roles for the other warriors ? everyone should be , too . ooh , yeah , maybe that 's hot , it 's loud , and it 's filled with meaningless action ... and it also feels like not one single person involved with the production could give two hoots . based on the kitschy , ridiculous but vaguely enjoyable 1981 adventure of the men walking across snowy mountains and grassy fields and stuff , just like in ‘ lord of the rings. ’ oh , and make sure all of the guys dress like the characters in ‘ 300 , ' because that movie made a ton of cash .
