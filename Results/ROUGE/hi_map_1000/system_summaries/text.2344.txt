manned and automated efforts combined have only mapped a small percentage of them , prompting xprize and partners to offer $ 7 million for robotic exploration platforms . " our oceans cover two-thirds of our planet 's surface and are a crucial global source of food , energy , economic security , and even the air we breathe , yet 95 percent of the deep sea remains a mystery to us , " says xprize head peter diamandis in the prize 's announcement . " the shell ocean discovery xprize will address a critical ocean challenge by accelerating innovation to further explore one of our greatest unexplored frontiers , " he said . " it involves underwater robotics , it involves computer science , there is a digital imagery component to itâ€¦ we expect a number of different approaches to this . " but the foundation has n't been able to create a high-resolution map , which will likely draw the attention of marine scientists , geologists and hobbyists everywhere . the top prize is $ 4 million , with a chance to win an extra million if the robot manages to follow a chemical or biological signal back to its source . this bonus , funded by national oceanic and atmospheric administration , could be very useful in tracking down deep-water creatures or finding geothermal vents .
