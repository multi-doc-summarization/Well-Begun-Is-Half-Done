ted cruz found herself in an unfavorable elevator at baltimoreâ€“washington international airport . in an attempt to free herself from the commuter prison , carpenter tweeted to her 90,000+ followers asking for help . guys . i 'm trapped in an amtrak elevator at bwi airport . help ? amanda carpenter ( @ amandacarpenter ) february 14 , 2016 on wednesday , nearly seven months later , amtrak came to carpenter 's rescue and responded to her original tweet , asking if she was still trapped inside the elevator . @ amandacarpenter bwi agents are aware of you , and are working to get you out . amtrak ( @ amtrak ) september 7 , 2016 amtrak later cleared up the confusion by stating that someone had recently re-tweeted the call for help , which put it back on its radar . while social media slip-ups from brands are the norm on twitter , amtrak 's failure to notice how much time had passed was a breath of fresh air . it was the notice showing inspection expiration for the elevator i was trapped inside . thx amtrak pic.twitter.com/bktkcioki5 , amanda carpenter , and the internet was highly amused .
