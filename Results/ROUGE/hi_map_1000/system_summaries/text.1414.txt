county commissioners gave final approval thursday to an order to stop an incinerator in oregon from receiving medical waste until procedures are in place to ensure no fetal tissue is burned to generate power . while taking the action , marion county commissioners sam brentano and janet carlson said they were horrified to learn that the marion county resource recovery facility in rural brooks might be burning medical waste that could contain fetal tissue . both strongly oppose abortions . " we 're going to get the bottom of it , " carlson said . " i want to know who knew , when they knew , how long they had known this was going on . " catholic newspaper , published by the roman archdiocese of vancouver , reported that “ aborted and miscarried children ” are also familiar with waste disposal , having worked in the industry for 30 years . he said clinical waste providers such as stericycle bring in medical waste ranging from syringes and body parts to laboratory cultures and bodily fluids after hospitals and clinics place it into red bags and sealed containers . " you 've got biological agent and infectious diseases in there , so they 're never opened once they 're sealed , " he tells the national post . " this is a disrespectful way to dispose of remains. .
