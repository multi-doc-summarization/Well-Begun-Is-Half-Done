" " i 've never met anyone who 's going to go to a dealership to ask advice about whether to buy a new car , " he writes . " that is , brokers are required to only propose products that are appropriate for the saver given his or her age , retirement goals , etc . " in washington , the new york times notes that the new rule will require retirement advisers to act in their best interests , and those who are paid directly by their clients , and generally charge based on the size of the fund they manage . " broker-dealers , i wanted to keep audit and accounting firms from selling consulting and other high-margin services to their audit clients . my fear was that the surest way to live forever was to become a federal program , " writes <unk> . " but rather than put forward their own ideas to address this problem , they ’ re attempting to dictate new parameters for the rule that would require it to be rewritten , thus running out the clock before president barack obama leaves office . as a former broker , i can not accept the argument that brokers are simply order-takers rather than advisers . responding to customers ’ directions and anxieties invariably involves a dialogue that veers into the area of advice and counsel .
