hbo now is available to users of apple inc. products and customers of cablevision systems , reports the new york times . the company is offering a 30-day free trial to customers who sign up in april . the launch comes in time for the premiere of the fifth season of users sharing hbo now 's success , the company has given itself full allowance to get much stricter about where and when you can watch . but do n't be alarmed just yet . fast company 's interview with ceo richard plepler hints that hbo now may eventually offer programming that wo n't appear on the main , linear network . those possibilities are exciting , but they 're watch on the website . obviously the app will be coming to other places eventually ( one can only assume android , xbox , and nearly every set-top box , much like hbo go ) , but for now it â€™ s ios , cablevision or nothing . but there 's no reason it should n't be ; hbo has made clear from the start that now would offer its full vault of original shows and catalog movies . you 're not losing anything here compared to cable customers , nor should you expect to get anything extra .
