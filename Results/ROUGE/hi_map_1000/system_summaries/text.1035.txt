texas is big , proud and … not really liked that much by people in other states , at least according to the results of a public policy polling survey released tuesday . " states like texas , given that it ’ s a well known brand and elicits a lot of positive support , it also has high negatives , " jones said . " you will always be the biggest ( as long as you ’ re only counting the continental states because alaska beats you by a lot . ) you have a higher opinion of new york by 27 points more than men , massachusetts by 22 , new hampshire by 15 , vermont and illinois by 13 , and connecticut and south dakota 10 . " the state of texas is many things , but when 1,200 americans were asked for their opinion of texas in the last several months , 31 percent responded unfavorably . the good news is that 40 percent responded favorably , but the difference in percentages wasn ’ t enough for the state to be viewed more positively than hawaii . or north dakota , the 9 percentage point difference in positive and negative opinions placed texas at 38th most liked state among the 50 united states .
