" we believe each and every style of beer is worth fussing over , " he writes . " quality isn â€™ t feel that having any connection with abinbev is something we can do while still maintaining our mission , values , and core beliefs . what this means is that we will not be able to lend our name to do the same . as some of you may know , and something many people have asked us about today , we have two collaboration beers with wicked weed currently in-progress ; one beer at our facility and one at theirs . we wish the best to everyone at wicked weed and we hope to remain personal friends in the future . sincerely , james howat and sarah howat black project spontaneous & wild .
