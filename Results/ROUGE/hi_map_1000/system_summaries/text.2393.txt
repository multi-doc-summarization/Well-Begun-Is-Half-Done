' " of the many superstars who died last year , including muhammad ali and merle haggard . when asked about why presley did n't show up for a recording session with dylan and george harrison , he replied : " he did show up . they performing these songs taught you anything you didn ’ t realize from listening to them ? i had some idea of where they stood , but i hadn ’ t realized how much of the essence of life is in them – the human condition , how perfectly the lyrics and melodies are intertwined , how relevant to everyday life they are , how non-materialistic . up to the sixties , these songs are some of the most heartbreaking stuff ever put on record and i wanted to do them justice .
