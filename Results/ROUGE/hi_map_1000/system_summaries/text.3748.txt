the spanish obamacare website is just about as awful as the name of the site itself can literally be read " for the caution of health . " " when you get into the details of the plans , it 's not all written in spanish . it 's written in spanglish , so we end up having to translate it for them , " said adrian madriz , a health care navigator who helps with enrollment in miami . the state with the nation ’ s highest percentage of latino residents and where more than 20 percent of the state 's population goes without health insurance , fewer than 1,000 people total signed up for coverage in october and november . " in my opinion , the website doesn ’ t work , " says grettl diaz , a 37-year-old miami gas station cashier who is originally from cuba . diaz said she tried to sign up at home using cuidadodesalud.gov . after she couldn ’ t own or use computers and are more comfortable speaking spanish than english . sixty-five percent of east palo alto ’ s population is latino , a group seen as crucial to the website , many people whom the law was designed to help have been left out of the first wave of coverage .
