" he was generous enough to erase his recognizable face and body entirely , and yet as a blue drawing was more vivid and lifelike , made lightning-fast comic connections in time and space that were at once hysterically funny and like nothing i had ever experienced before , " he writes . " it was as a dazzling , unknown stand-up comedian that i first met him . in a pair of linked meetings , he made an impression on me that in an unnerving film at a time when voice acting was an anonymous profession , and a fairly brave comic known for working blue to abandon anything that was n't safe for young children . and yet unlike many of his contemporaries , williams had a particular impact on the slice of the population now in our mid-to-late 20s and early 30s . through the 1990s , williams , an established film star , shifted into a new gear in his career ; he generously and humbly took on entertainment for kids . williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns , but for people my age , williams was our childhood . williams ' filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects .
