the polish ambassador to washington has protested the us ambassador and demanded an apology over comments on the holocaust by fbi director james comey . the foreign ministry said that some poles were accomplices , the ap reports . " in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of germany , and poland , and hungary , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil , " he said . " to those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way , i want to say that poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of world war two . i have asked those questions many times as i have confronted unimaginable suffering and loss . and i know i am in good company asking such questions . last month , on a flight home from eastern europe , one that simply defies words and challenges meaning . i was born into an irish catholic family in this great , wonderful and safe country , but the holocaust has always haunted me , and it has long stood as a stumbling block to faith . how could such a thing be ? how is that consistent with the concept of a god with a role in human history ? how could there possibly be meaning in life , when so many lives were snuffed out in such a fashion ? is a mistake , harmful and insulting .
