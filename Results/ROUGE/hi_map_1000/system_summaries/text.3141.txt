donald trump was on defense saturday as he kicked off a three-day sprint to wisconsin 's primary . trump began the afternoon with a rally in the milwaukee suburb of racine , where he defended a series of controversial comments in recent days on nato , abortion and nuclear weapons . " this politics is a hypothetical , so i thought of it in terms of a hypothetical . so that â€™ s where that answer came from , hypothetically. , " he said . " if i had to do it again , i would n't have sent it . " among his biggest missteps have been trump 's recent comments on abortion , which have managed to unite both abortion rights activists and opponents in their criticism . during a taping of " face the nation " on friday , trump said he believed that laws wo n't change until he 's president and appoints judges who can interpret them differently . it was the second time in days that he 'd stepped in hot water over the issue . on wednesday , he 'd said women should be punished for getting abortions if they 're ever banned . when he was a swinging bachelor in manhattan , was he ever involved with anyone who had an abortion ? " the laws are set . and i think we have to leave it that way . " trump 's abortion comments raised concerns in the republican party about whether his unpopularity with women as measured in preference polling would make him unelectable in a general election match-up against democrat hillary clinton .
