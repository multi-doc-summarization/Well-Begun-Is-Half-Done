a man waiting overnight in las vegas ' mccarran airport with practically no one else around , richard dunn could have taken a cab back to the strip and partied until his flight in the morning . instead , he whipped out his iphone and made this gloriously cheesy music video for celine dion 's 1996 cover of " all by myself . " and he really did make it all by himself , with an ingenious repurposing of the airport 's escalators and moving walkways . " i had a person behind a ticket counter give me a roll of luggage tape before she left , " dunn said . " then i would put it on the moving walkway for a dolly shot . i also used the extended handle on my computer bag and taped the iphone to my handle . i would tuck different stuff under the bag to get the right angle . for the escalator shot i had to sprint up the steps after i got my shot so the computer bag did n't hit the top and fall back down . quite fun ! " that 's all pretty clever , but it was recreating the flashdance scene using a water bottle that really put the video over the top .
