china on sunday began a suspension of all coal imports from north korea for the rest of the year as it increases pressure on its communist neighbor to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs . the ban is in line with u.n. security council sanctions imposed in november in response to north korea 's fifth nuclear test two months earlier , the commerce ministry said . china 's ministry of commerce , in a public notice jointly issued with the country 's customs agency saturday , said the decision was made to comply with a un security council resolution that china helped draft and pass last november . resolution 2321 imposed some of the toughest sanctions yet against the north korean regime , after it disregarded an earlier un ban to test what it said was a nuclear warhead in september 2016 . " imports of coal produced in north korea -- including shipments already declared to the customs but yet to be released -- will be suspended for the remainder of this year , " said the statement posted on the ministry 's website . coal is north korea in april last year , but those restrictions allowed some imports for civilian use .
