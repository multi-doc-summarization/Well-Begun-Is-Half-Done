nasa 's hubble space telescope have seen for the first time an asteroid with six comet-like tails of dust . designated p/2013 p5 , the asteroid resembles a rotating lawn sprinkler . " we were literally dumbfounded when we saw it , " said lead investigator david jewitt of the university of california at los angeles . " even more amazing , its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust . that also caught us by surprise . it ’ s hard to believe we ’ re looking at an asteroid . " the asteroid 's nucleus , which measures 1,400 feet wide , is thousands of times more massive than the observed amount of ejected , a small fraction of the p/2013 p5 's main mass , has been lost . the uneven heating on an asteroid ’ s surface can cause it to “ spin up. ” in a nutshell , the yorp effect heats up the sun-facing side of an asteroid , but as the asteroid rotates , it radiates heat into space from the dark side . this heat radiation is carried away by infrared photons that themselves exert a tiny amount of momentum , or recoil , as they depart the asteroid .
