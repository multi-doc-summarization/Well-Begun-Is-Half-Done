a town in italy has imposed a temporary ban on the traditional way of pizza-making as a measure to curb soaring pollution . an edict issued by the mayor of san vitaliano , just outside of naples , bans the use of wood-fired stoves in bakeries and eateries including pizzerias unless their owners install special filters to reduce air pollution . the measure has been prompted by " utmost concern " over worsening air quality , and will stay in place until 31 march . it can be reintroduced by police checks , and those found in breach of the mayor 's order will face fines of up to a mysterious smog hanging over the city . san vitaliano exceeded the threshold for emissions 114 times , compared to 86 times in milan , another badly polluted italian city , spent 86 days breathing unsafe air . " naples has many more pizzerias than san vitaliano but does n't have the same pollution levels . it 's clear that they do n't want to pinpoint the real cause . this order is a very costly mistake for us , " he said . " but the situation has got worse during the winter and we need to take maximum precautions to ensure the problem does n't deteriorate . "
