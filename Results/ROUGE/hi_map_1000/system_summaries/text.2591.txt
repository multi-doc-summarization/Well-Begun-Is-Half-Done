a indianapolis pet saved a family 's bacon during an unusual home break-in on indy 's east side this week . the back door of the home is now boarded up after crooks shattered the glass and kicked their way inside . " they completely damaged my door . the entire door is ruined , " said the homeowner . " the cop was like we definitely think they got in and made it to where dumplin was and thought , ‘ nope . we don ’ t want to deal with this . " dumplin 's owner is just relieved the pig didn ’ t get hurt during the crime , but the family 's pet pig says it were three home burglaries on the same day , separated by just two blocks . " i guess it 's something that i should have looked into , " she said . " it ’ s definitely terrifying you don ’ want anything like that to happen. . " she says she wishes more people would adopt pet pigs , even if they won ’ t always keep the bad guys away . " there ’ s tons of miniature pigs that are in shelters and rescues that do n't have homes , and they 're great animals , " he said .
