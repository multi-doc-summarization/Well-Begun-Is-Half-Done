a antarctic expedition was stranded on a plateau only hours before completing his voyage after a blizzard forced the evacuation of the majority of his support team . tim jarvis and mountaineer barry gray “ hunkered down ” in a tent at shackleton ’ s gap in order to avoid the extreme weather conditions , including wind gusts of 45 knots and a mixture of rain , sleet and snow causing zero visibility . jarvis was ultimately able to arrange the famous expedition of british adventurer , along with four other members of the british-australian team , reports the bbc . " the ice climb at the tridents is a serious thing and shackleton did n't exaggerate -- with ice at 50 degrees , with one wrong foot , we could have careened down a crevasse , " he said . " there 's no doubt in my mind that everyone has a shackleton double in them and i hope we 've been able to emulate some of what they achieved . " jarvis , 46 , said he and gray , 38 , had more than 20 crevasse falls up to their knees during the climb with the latter plunging into one up to his armpits , requiring their one-man support crew to help pull him free .
