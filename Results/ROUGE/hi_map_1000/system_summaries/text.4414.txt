" i ’ m really glad to see that the committee voted for this bill , " allen said . " they pay taxes , they have jobs and they drive on our city . " " they do have skin in the game in their communities , " says a 16-year-old student at basis d.c. . " we ’ ve worked hard to get the word out by talking to other youth and meeting with councilmembers , and it ’ s great to see [ our voice is being heard and valued. . " the bill will be voted on by the full council and signed into law by mayor muriel bowser . allen unsuccessfully introduced the measure in 2015 and revived it this year , inspired by high school student protests against gun violence following the feb. 14 shooting at stoneman douglas high school in parkland , florida . a public hearing in june drew dozens of young people to the wilson building to testify in favor of the measure . about 70 people testified in support of the bill and nobody testified against it , according to allen . supporters claim young people vote at higher rates than adults when they are given the chance , and that teens who are allowed to vote are more likely to develop a lifelong habit of voting .
