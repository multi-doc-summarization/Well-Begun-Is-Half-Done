a 23-year-old toronto student living at home just got schooled about failing to give his mother the respect she deserves . " we got into a discussion that it doesn ’ t cost a lot for him to live here , " she said . " it was intended to be tongue-in-cheek , although obviously i was a little annoyed by him , as you can see with that thousand dollar itemized ‘ unappreciative ' comment . but he was never expected to pay it . it was really just to prove a point and to make him wake up . " chalipo 's mom tells abc news that it was " for services delivered free of charge in the last 13 months alone ( except for tuition – which is 5 years ) , " he says . " i thought it was one of those things that everyone would appreciate and get a good laugh out of it . i expected a couple of witty reflection , i let my mom know how effective this invoice was to help me understand how much she does for me thousand dollar . " the post notes that her son did n't get it .
