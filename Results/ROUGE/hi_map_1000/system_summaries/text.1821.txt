the best friend of sergei skripal believes the poisoned double agent and his daughter yulia are so critically ill they should be allowed to die . ross cassidy , a haulage contractor , told the bbc : " out of 99 % i have maybe 1 % of hope . whatever it was a bit unusual having a russian family there , but they were very friendly and when they bought their own home nearby and moved out we continued our friendship . sergei 's english was okay , though his wife 's was n't and she did n't mix so much , but he used to call me his english friend . he was very generous and never forgot my birthday , usually buying me an expensive bottle of whisky . " " i was aware of his background and i ca n't say i approve of treachery , but that was none of my business , " he said , per the bbc . " we became great pals and i introduced sergei to a lot of things , including english beer and he introduced me to vodka . " the bbc notes that the russian mission would be cut from 30 to 20 people , adding that the gesture was " a clear and very strong message that there was a cost to russia 's reckless actions . "
