a new website from wolfram alpha will attempt to identify any image you show it , though it ’ s more amusing than practical at the moment . to check it out , head to imageidentify.com and drop in any photo from your computer or mobile device . the site will spend a few seconds mulling it over before taking a guess at what the picture is showing . " it won ’ t always get it right , but most of the time i think it does remarkably well , " wolfram writes . " and to me what ’ s particularly fascinating is that when it does get something wrong , the mistakes it makes mostly seem remarkably human , " he said . " i plugged in things like yosemite national park 's half dome and was told it was " elevation . " the system was trained with cats , sloths , and chewbacca in order to train the system , wolfram says it was fed " a few tens of millions " of images so that it still has difficulty recognizing specific people , art , and things that are not " real everyday objects . "
