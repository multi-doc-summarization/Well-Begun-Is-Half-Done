" if you could smell the comet , you probably wish that you had n't , " the team tells the university of bern . " this is mixed with the faint , bitter , almond-like aroma of hydrogen cyanide . " the device , called rosina-dfms , is a mass spectrometer—it has been analysing the signature of gas given off by the " coma , " with a backup site on the larger lobe . the sites were selected just six weeks after rosetta 's aug. 6 arrival at the comet 's coma , the ap reports . the comet is still more than 400 million kilometres from the sun , causing it to release more gas and form the coma characteristic of comets , the bbc notes . the device is passive on the smaller of the comet ’ s coma is surprisingly rich already , but it 's not clear whether the comet will be within a " landing ellipse , " which notes that the comet has been conducting an unprecedented scientific analysis of the sun .
