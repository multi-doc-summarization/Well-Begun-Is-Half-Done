a fossil hunter might contain a bit of preserved dinosaur brain tissue from a dinosaur . the fossil comes from a species closely related to iguanodon , a large herbivore that lived about 130 million years ago . a collector named jamie hiscocks found it in 2004 , near bexhill in the united kingdom . " he picked it up and noticed that it was slightly unusual in its shape and its texture , " says alex liu of the university of cambridge . " there 's a series of bumps to this specimen that are quite characteristic of it fitting into the brain case of a dinosaur , " he said , per the washington post . " the chances of preserving gets made when sediment fills up a dinosaur 's skull cavity and hardens . later , if the skull breaks off and disappears , what 's left behind is a solid object that reveals the shape of the skull 's inner cavity . what 's different about this particular example , liu says , is that the outer millimeter or so of this fossil is actually mineralization of some of the soft tissue structures that were preserved before they decayed away within the original dinosaur brain case .
