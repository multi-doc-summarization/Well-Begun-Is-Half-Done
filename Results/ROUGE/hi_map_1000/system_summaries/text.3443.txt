a drone strike on suspected islamist militants in northwest pakistan killed 10 people on thursday , pakistani intelligence officials say , an attack likely to raise tensions in a standoff with washington over nato supply routes to afghanistan . the pilotless drone aircraft attacked a compound in a village in north waziristan , a day after a similar attack killed four suspected militants in the same region . " the drone fired two missiles at the compound . we believe it was being used by militants , " one of the pakistani officials said . the united states has been urging pakistan to mount an offensive in north <unk> to pursue members of the haqqani militant network , in a joint statement called afridi 's sentence " shocking and outrageous . " what dr. afridi did is the furthest thing from treason . it was a courageous , heroic and patriotic act which helped to locate the most wanted terrorist in the world , a mass murderer who had the blood of many innocent pakistanis on his hands , " the two senators said . mccain and levin urged pakistan to pardon and free afridi . " dr. afridi 's continuing imprisonment and treatment as a criminal will only do further harm to us-pakistani relations , including diminishing congress 's willingness to provide financial assistance to pakistan , " they said .
