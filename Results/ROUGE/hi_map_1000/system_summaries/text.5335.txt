" we 'll have to discuss it as a caucus , but i would support that move . " virginia sen. mark warner , the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee , proposed the idea after president donald trump fired fbi director james comey last week . trump has yet to name his choice to replace comey , for which interviews have taken place this weekend , and the justice department thus far has declined to appoint a special prosecutor or create an independent investigative commission . acknowledging democrats ' limited influence in congress , schumer told anchor jake tapper on cnn 's " this week . " pressed if he meant us institutions were under assault internally from the president , clapper responded , " exactly .
