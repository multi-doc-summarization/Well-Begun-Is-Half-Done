president trump drove out his chief of staff on friday , replacing reince priebus with homeland security secretary john kelly in an explosive move that ends a turbulent six-month tenure . " the president wanted to go a different direction , " priebus tells cnn . " i 'm on team trump and i look forward to helping him achieve his goals and his agenda for the american people . " in his interview with cnn , priebus repeatedly said he submitted his resignation to the president privately on thursday . yet throughout the day on friday afternoon that sources close to priebus reached out to reporters to say that he had resigned the day before . other white house officials questioned that version of events , suggesting priebus and his allies were trying to put a positive spin on the president 's abrupt decision to bring on kelly . one of those conservative voices was rep. mark meadows , the chair of the house freedom caucus , who met with the president at the white house on friday . priebus , who had traveled with trump to long island for an event on gang violence , was seated inside a secret service van on the tarmac when the message came down . his vehicle split away from the motorcade and departed for washington before trump himself got off the plane .
