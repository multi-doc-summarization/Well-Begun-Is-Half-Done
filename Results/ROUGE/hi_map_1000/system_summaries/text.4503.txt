uganda 's parliament has passed a bill to toughen the punishment for homosexual acts to include life imprisonment in some cases , the bbc reports . the anti-homosexuality bill also makes it a crime punishable by a prison sentence not to report gay people . the lawmaker behind the bill , david bahati , said a death penalty clause was dropped from the final version of the bill . the approved text must now be given the green light by president yoweri museveni , himself a devout evangelical christian . " this is a victory for uganda . i am glad the parliament has voted against evil , " bahati told afp . " because we are a god-fearing nation , we value life in a holistic way . it is because of those values that members of parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks , " he said . " we will get hold of all those encouraging others to become homosexuals or lesbians . anybody we find recruiting or using materials to promote homosexuality , we will arrest . " the bill has been condemned by rights activists and women in the country face frequent harassment and threats of violence , and rights activists have also reported cases of lesbians in uganda on the front page along with a second time , as well as for gay sex where one partner is a minor or has hiv . authorities need to be able to gather evidence that shows someone has engaged in homosexuality . this is hard to prove and one of the reasons uganda 's current anti-gay legislation has been rarely enforced .
