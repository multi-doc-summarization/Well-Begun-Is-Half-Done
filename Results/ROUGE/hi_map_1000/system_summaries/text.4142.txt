scientists have learned that upwards of 25 percent of all people who become infected with ebola show none of the typical symptoms , the ap reports . the finding suggests the recent west african ebola epidemic was more widespread than previously thought , and that new methods need to be developed to diagnose and contain the dreaded virus during an outbreak . the team identified 193 adults and children over age 4 who had lived with or shared a latrine with a confirmed case of ebola during the period of active transmission but were never identified as evd cases . researchers reporting in plos neglected tropical diseases shows , a phd candidate in anthropology at stanford university and a former fellow in the division of infectious diseases and geographic medicine , now confirms this suspicion , while providing an actual estimate for the rate of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections in ebola patients . the researchers collected blood from 187 of these individuals . they then tested the blood samples -- as well as positive and negative controls from known ebola cases and people not exposed to the virus -- for ebola glycoprotein antibodies , the presence of which indicates a past ebola infection .
