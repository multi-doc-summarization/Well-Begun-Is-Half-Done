secret unmanned spy plane to be uncovered isn ’ t just a design idea , it 's already flying at the air force ’ s famed area 51 . unlike the recently announced sr-72 , the new rq-180 from northrop grumman is believed to be currently in flight testing according to aviation week and space technology . the aircraft will conduct the penetrating isr mission that has been left unaddressed , and under wide debate , since retirement of the lockheed sr-71 in 1998 . the blackbird plane would be able to fly undetected in airspace where the u.s. does not have permission and/or the protection needed to fly . this denied airspace capability has been missing from the company ’ s determination to retire a version of the rq-4b global hawk after 2014 , despite congressional resistance . the rq-180 is thought to largely address the problem of flying in hostile airspace through improved stealth design and better aerodynamics . " the new uas has flown missions over iran and pakistan , but the aircraft lacks the endurance of other unmanned aircraft for spying continues to rise year after year , " he writes . " it could also be capable of electronic attack missions . "
