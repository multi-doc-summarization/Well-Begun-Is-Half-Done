it 's not clear what the cold war is over , but it 's a good time for the wood : it 's the ants of the bunker , but the new york times reports . " the ants have nevertheless carried on for years underground , building a nest from soil and maintaining it in typical wood ant fashion . except , of course , that this situation is far from normal . temperatures rarely hit 50 degrees , even in the summer . but do these ants give up in despair ? no , they do not matter . a younger generation is on its way , ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless , pointless labor and observe the animals inside , " writes <unk> <unk> at the los angeles times . " they produce no queens , no males , and mostly barren , the ants seem to live in a state of near-starvation . because conditions in the bunker are so harsh , constantly cold , and no offspring . the massive group tending the nest is entirely composed of non-reproductive female workers , supplemented every year by a new rain of unfortunate ants falling down the ventilation shaft . like most ant species , wood ants are tidy animals who remove waste from their colony . in the case of the nest ants , most of this waste is composed of dead bodies .
