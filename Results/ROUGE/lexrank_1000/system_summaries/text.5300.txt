though it ’ s unclear whether genetics or other factors are responsible , new study suggests that lethal violence is part of our evolutionary history humans are predisposed to murder each other , new research suggests , although it remains unclear if it ’ s down to genetics or other factors . newline_char pinker has previously argued that humans engage in lethal violence as a “ natural condition , ” but that deaths from such violence have decreased with the rise of modern societies with sophisticated institutions and laws . newline_char “ what it is saying , in the broadest terms , is that humans have evolved strategies for solving problems with violence , ” said mark pagel , professor of evolutionary biology at the university of reading , who was not involved in the research . newline_char “ at least to some extent , the way humans organise in societies influences our levels of lethal violence. story_separator_special_tag " as a group , mammals average a lethal violence rate against their own of about three killings of their own species in 1,000 deaths . newline_char the " root " violence rate of early humans and many of our closer primate cousins is about 20 in 1,000 , said study lead author jose maria gomez at the university of granada in spain . newline_char that means that based on other rather murderous species closely related to us , humans have " inherited their propensity for violence . newline_char scientists calculated the rate at which more than 1,000 mammal species kill their own kind , and noticed how closely related species have similar rates of lethal violence . newline_char humans are " in a position within a particularly violent mammalian clade , in which violence seems to have been ancestrally present , " the study in the journal nature says .
