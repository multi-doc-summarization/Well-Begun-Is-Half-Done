e solution we propose for vw and the carb is to , in a legally enforceable form : 1./ release vw from its obligation to fix diesel cars already on the road in california , which represent an insignificant portion of total vehicles emissions in the state , and which cars do not , individually , present any emissions-related risk to their owners or occupants 2./ instead , direct vw to accelerate greatly its rollout of zero emission vehicles , which by their very nature , have zero emissions and thus present zero opportunities for cheating , and also do not require any enforcement dollars to verify 3./ require that this acceleration of the rollout of zero emissions vehicles by vw result in a 10 for 1 or greater reduction in pollutant emissions as compared to the pollution associated with the diesel fleet cheating , and achieve this over the next 5 years 4./ require that vw invest in new manufacturing plants and/or research and development , in the amounts that they otherwise would have been fined , and do so in california to the extent that california would have been allocated its share of the fines 5./ allow vw some flexibility in the execution and timing of this plan by allowing it to be implemented via zero emission vehicle credits . story_separator_special_tag tesla motors chief executive elon musk and more than three dozen others are urging california regulators to push volkswagen ag toward more environmentally friendly vehicles after the german auto giant recently used software to cheat on emissions tests with diesel-powered cars . story_separator_special_tag the letter , which is available in full here , offers a detailed plan , proposing that carb “ release vw from its obligation to fix diesel cars already on the road in california ; ” direct vw instead to “ accelerate greatly its rollout of zero emission vehicles ; ” and to require that vw invest in r & d or new plants “ in the amounts that they otherwise would have been fined , ” with the share of fine dollars that would have gone to california being used for investment specifically in california . newline_char instead of focusing on fixing diesel cars , musk and his colleagues said , volkswagen should be required to put its resources toward becoming a zero-emissions car company .
