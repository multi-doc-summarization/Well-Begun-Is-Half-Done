tory_separator_special_tag in my opinion if you visit this location after this review you have no right to be mad if the food is as bad as i bet it will be . newline_char also , i hope that the manager and cooks of this location go to a restaurant and spend 3 times as much as i did and get burnt food they will have no choice but to pay for it . newline_char i left everything on my plate and had to go to a different restaurant to get decent food . newline_char food was ok , i 've had much better . newline_char i generally tip at least 20 % not even close thi the food is poor and overpriced . newline_char i paid for that mistake because in my opinion the food was old and down right unedible because it came out burnt and dry . newline_char i prefer chick-fil-a myself yelp continues to remove my reviews although they 've been honest and well written . newline_char never thought i 'd like it , since i 'm more of a vegetarian , but i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised . newline_char suffered gastric distress , possibly food poisoning a few hours after dinner . newline_char .the food stinks . newline_char red hen does n't like bad reviews , so they rather have fake reviews . newline_char staff did n't care and acted like it happened all the time . newline_char honestly , it was not as sad of an experience as i thought it would be . newline_char sanders to another restaurant to continue taunting and harassing her . newline_char made the mistake of ignoring the previous reviews and went to this location on 7/10/18 anyways . newline_char i will repost my review when yelp stops its censorship . newline_char thanks yelp for deleting my honest review ... newline_char i left an honest but not complementary review last month but yelp keeps deleting it .
