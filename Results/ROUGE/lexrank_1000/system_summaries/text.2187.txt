 understand this aspect of the water-to-land transition , we surveyed the latimeria genome annotations to identify genes that were present in the last common ancestor of all bony fish ( including the coelacanth ) but that are missing from tetrapod genomes . newline_char more than 50 such genes , including components of fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) signalling , tgf-β and bone morphogenic protein ( bmp ) signalling , and wnt signalling pathways , as well as many transcription factor genes , were inferred to be lost based on the coelacanth data ( supplementary data 7 and supplementary fig . newline_char previous studies of genes that were lost in this transition could only compare teleost fish to tetrapods , meaning that differences in gene content could have been due to loss in the tetrapod or in the lobe-finned fish lineages . newline_char however , homeobox genes , which are responsible for the development of an organism ’ s basic body plan , show only slight differences between latimeria , ray-finned fish and tetrapods ; it would seem that the protein-coding portion of this gene family , along with several others ( supplementary note 9 , supplementary tables 12–16 and supplementary fig . newline_char as vertebrates transitioned to a new land environment , changes occurred not only in gene content but also in the regulation of existing genes . story_separator_special_tag amemiya ’ s team has sifted through the coelacanth ’ s genome for genes that might have helped its cousin species , the ancestor to the first tetrapod , invade dry land some 400 million years ago . newline_char the coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods , meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants , from reptiles and birds to mammals .
