e way that tesla envisions it working is that the car detects the driver 's intent to change lanes or make a turn by using the autopilot hardware at its disposal , it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them , it puts the signal on for the driver . newline_char tesla wants its vehicles to signal automatically without the driver needing to go through the agony that is lifting their finger and moving it up or down by several inches . newline_char if it works , it will be brilliant but given the fact that tesla has remained adamant that it does n't need driver monitoring systems for autopilot , it seems questionable that the vehicle would be able to detect a driver 's intent to turn based solely on external observation . story_separator_special_tag currently , tesla drivers can initiate a lane change on autopilot but they have to make sure the way is clear and activate the turn signal – only then will autopilot drive the car in the next lane . newline_char here ’ s the full patent application : electrek ’ s take it sounds like tesla might have been working on detecting when it should activate its turn signal when the vehicle is driving automatically and figured out that it could also be useful technology when drivers are manually driving their vehicles . newline_char ” here ’ s a flowchart that explains when the system would activate the turn signal for the driver : tesla has applied for an international patent to use its sensors and onboard processor to make this work . newline_char by leveraging its autopilot technology , the automaker thinks it can detect when a driver should activate its turn signal and do it for them if they forget it .
