tory_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag the arrival 36 years ago of a strange bird to a remote island in the galapagos archipelago has provided direct genetic evidence of a novel way in which new species arise . newline_char in this week 's issue of the journal science , researchers from princeton university and uppsala university in sweden report that the newcomer belonging to one species mated with a member of another species resident on the island , giving rise to a new species that today consists of roughly 30 individuals . newline_char " through our work on daphne major , we were able to observe the pairing up of two birds from different species and then follow what happened to see how speciation occurred . newline_char " in 1981 , a graduate student working with the grants on daphne major noticed the newcomer , a male that sang an unusual song and was much larger in body and beak size than the three resident species of birds on the island . story_separator_special_tag there are at least 15 species of darwin 's finches , so named because their diversity helped famed naturalist charles darwin figure out his theory of evolution by natural selection - that is , mutations can help species become better adapted to their environment , and be passed down to subsequent generations . newline_char as one of the larger species of darwin 's finches , and with a different song than the three native daphne major species , the newcomer - a male - stood out . story_separator_special_tag the group of finch species to which the big bird population belongs are collectively known as darwin 's finches and helped charles darwin to uncover the process of evolution by natural selection . newline_char professors rosemary and peter grant noticed that this male proceeded to mate with a female of one of the local species , a medium ground finch , producing fertile young .
