tory_separator_special_tag “ there has been lots of epidemiological information showing a relationship between fibre and obesity , but no one has been able to connect the epidemiological results with actual mechanisms , ” says jimmy bell , a biochemist at imperial college london who worked on the research , published today in nature communications1 . newline_char they fed mice fibre labelled with carbon-13 , which has an additional neutron from the more common carbon-12 that gives its nuclei a magnetic spin and therefore makes it easy to track as it progresses through the body 's  newline_char peter cade/getty a study of mouse metabolism suggests that a product of fibre fermentation may be directly affecting the hypothalamus , a region of the brain involved in regulating appetite . story_separator_special_tag researchers at imperial college discovered that people feel full when eating fruit and vegetables because fibre releases acetate into the gut . newline_char the new study suggests obesity has become an epidemic because we have replaced the healthy diet of the past with processed food , which does not react with gut bacteria to produce acetate . story_separator_special_tag these mice ate less and gained less weight than mice who did not consume inulin , and when the scientists took a deeper look , they discovered that the inulin-eating mice had higher levels of acetate in their gut . newline_char acetate , the researchers discovered , is naturally released when fiber is digested in the gut , and when it ’ s released , it is taken to the brain where it signals us to stop eating . newline_char but this new research published in the journal nature communications shows that the acetate released when we digest roughage lowers our appetites when it gets directly into our bloodstream , colon or brain . newline_char time health for more , visit time health scientists have figured out the reason fiber is such a wonder food : it contains an anti-appetite molecule called acetate .
