e water is stored in the air space between the ice particles , like the juice in a snow cone prof rick forster , university of utah according to the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the ice sheet lost 34 billion tonnes of ice per year between 1992 and 2001 - but this increased to 215 billion tonnes between 2002 and 2011 scientists still have many unanswered questions about the direction and speed and ultimate destination of this melted water . newline_char image caption researchers were surprised to see liquid water coming up through the drill hole as temperatures were below freezing researchers say they have discovered a large reservoir of melt water that sits under the greenland ice sheet all year round . newline_char " instead of the water being stored in the air space between subsurface rock particles , the water is stored in the air space between the ice particles , like the juice in a snow cone . story_separator_special_tag every year , greenland adds 0.03 inches ( 0.7 mm ) of water to global sea level rise from melting snow and ice , forster said . newline_char water from the greenland snow aquifer draining from a drill core extracted 40 feet ( 12 meters ) below the surface of the ice sheet in april , before the summer surface melt , with air temperatures of 5 degrees fahrenheit ( minus 15 degrees celsius ) . newline_char until now , researchers thought most of this water went to the ocean or refroze on the ice . newline_char [ top 10 surprising results of global warming ] where water flows no one yet knows how old the water in the aquifer is , and whether it stays trapped in the snow or reaches the ocean in slow streams or catastrophic floods .
