r atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 vsmow , which would mean that early mars ( 4.5 billion years ago ) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep . story_separator_special_tag a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold , nasa scientists say . newline_char on mars , water containing normal hydrogen is lost to space over time , but the heavier form is left behind . newline_char martian water , like that on earth , contains standard water molecules , made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom , and another form of water made with a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium . newline_char “ a major question has been how much water did mars actually have when it was young and how did it lose that water ? newline_char when normal water is lost on mars , the concentration of deuterium in water left behind goes  newline_char the huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet ’ s surface , as great a portion as the atlantic covers the earth , and was a mile deep in places . newline_char unveiled by nasa on thursday , the compelling evidence for the primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of mars as a warm and wet world in its youth , which trickled with streams , winding river deltas , and long-standing lakes , soon after it formed 4.5bn years ago . story_separator_special_tag but they probably suggest only the minimum amount of water that pooled on the ancient surface of mars , he newline_char but on mars the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into outer space—the planet 's thin atmosphere can be seen in this photo taken by the viking 1 orbiter .
