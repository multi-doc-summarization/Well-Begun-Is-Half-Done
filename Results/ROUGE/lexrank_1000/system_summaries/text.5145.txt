zi ( inset photo ) , a stone age man who died atop a glacier about 5300 years ago , suffered from severe gum disease and cavities . newline_char that gruel may be the culprit behind ötzi 's cavities and gum disease , too . newline_char the results , published this week in the european journal of oral sciences , suggest that ötzi did n't have it easy . story_separator_special_tag now sequencing of his y chromosome places him in the rare g2a4 haplogroup , meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the near east for europe at the beginning of the neolithic era , roughly 1000 years before ötzi himself lived . newline_char the genome analysis , published this week in nature communications , also helps flesh out our picture of ötzi the man : researchers now know he had brown eyes , brown hair , type-o blood , and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among neolithic europeans . newline_char earlier computer scans had revealed ötzi 's severe arteriosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries . newline_char few of our ancestors have been so thoroughly poked and prodded as neolithic tyrolean iceman " ötzi , " discovered melting out of an alpine glacier in 1991 . newline_char burgdorferi genome from ötzi with more modern incarnations of the pathogen , they wo n't have a clear picture of how lyme disease evolves . newline_char the whole genome sequencing also reveals more about ötzi 's ancestors . newline_char earlier research analyzed ötzi 's mitochondrial dna , which is inherited through only the female line , but had found few known matches among modern populations . newline_char ötzi 's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of sardinia and corsica , as well as some of the more remote areas of georgia and russia , says geneticist angela graefen of the institute for mummies and the iceman in bolzano , italy , one of the principal researchers on the paper .
