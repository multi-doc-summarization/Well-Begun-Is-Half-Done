lm reviews eat pray love -- film review " eat pray love " bottom line : a heavily idealized journey of self-discovery with a pretty woman ( julia roberts ) , pretty scenery and a pretty shallow view of eastern spirituality . newline_char in " eat pray love , " julia robert 's character , liz gilbert , takes a holiday from her miserable life as a well-respected , financially secure new york writer , loved by men she can not love back and despairing of her own inner emptiness . newline_char so with julia roberts making one of her increasingly rare starring appearances and the sensual beauty of italy , india and indonesia as backdrop for the romanticized navel-gazing , " eat pray love " should attract a substantial female audience , a demographic ill-served by the summer 's mostly testosterone-fueled movies.working from a screenplay he wrote with jennifer salt , director ryan murphy , the creator of tv series " nip/tuck " and " glee , " never loses track of the story 's bestseller attributes : foreign landscapes photographed at sunset or sunrise , food displayed with mouth-watering intensity , peripheral characters bursting with vitality , all men unnaturally gorgeous -- or at least interesting -- and female self-discovery as the unwavering central focus.reeling from a divorce and an affair that did n't do the trick either , liz tells her best friend and publisher ( viola davis , not given nearly enough to do ) that she intends to chuck everything for a year to research herself in exotic foreign climes . story_separator_special_tag on the other hand , eat pray love , the movie , has julia roberts as liz gilbert ! newline_char if anyone can make chowing down on a plate full of spaghetti look like a joyful , sensual prelude to enlightenment , it 's roberts , who offers herself as our julia as generously as gilbert connects with readers as our liz . newline_char absolutely nothing , that 's what , as millions of readers of elizabeth gilbert 's phenomenally successful 2006 memoir eat , pray , love will attest . newline_char the high-concept structure of gilbert 's confessional story is surely a draw : after a painful divorce , the author ships off on a yearlong international odyssey to pick up the pieces of her shattered self , touching down in italy to eat , india to pray , and bali to fall in love . newline_char eat pray love , the movie , directed by glee co-creator ryan murphy , ca n't muster the sound of elizabeth gilbert being liz .
