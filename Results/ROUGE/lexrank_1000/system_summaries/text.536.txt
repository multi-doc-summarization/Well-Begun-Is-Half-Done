e early evidence , presented at a recent volcanology conference , shows that yellowstone â€™ s most recent supereruption was sparked when new magma moved into the system  newline_char beneath yellowstone national park lies a supervolcano , a behemoth far more powerful than your average volcano . story_separator_special_tag after analyzing minerals in fossilized ash from the most recent mega-eruption , researchers at arizona state university think the supervolcano last woke up after two influxes of fresh magma flowed into the reservoir below the caldera . newline_char if the supervolcano underneath yellowstone erupts again , we may have far less advance warning time than we thought . story_separator_special_tag there 's a supervolcano under yellowstone , capable of shooting 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into the air . story_separator_special_tag credit : credit : usgs in the unlikely event of a volcanic supereruption at yellowstone national park , the northern rocky mountains would be blanketed in meters of ash , and millimeters would be deposited as far away as new york city , los angeles and miami , according to a new study . newline_char an example of the possible distribution of ash from a month-long yellowstone supereruption . newline_char the improved computer model , detailed in a new study published in geochemistry , geophysics , geosystems , finds that the hypothetical , large eruption would create a distinctive kind of ash cloud known as an umbrella , which expands evenly in all directions , sending ash across north america . newline_char ash distribution will vary depending on cloud height , eruption duration , diameter of volcanic particles in the cloud , and wind conditions , according to the new study . newline_char an improved computer model developed by the study 's authors finds that the hypothetical , large eruption would create a distinctive kind of ash cloud known as an umbrella  story_separator_special_tag
