tory_separator_special_tag the tammar wallaby ( macropus eugenii ) is only the third marsupial to have its genome sequenced . newline_char " key marsupial traits dr elizabeth murchison , a marsupial specialist at the wellcome trust sanger institute in cambridge , uk , described the study as " a wonderful tool for studying the evolution of marsupials , and mammals in general , and an impressive piece of work looking at one of australia 's iconic species . newline_char the team says the first kangaroo genome is a milestone in the study of mammalian evolution . newline_char tammar wallaby young spend nine months in their mother 's pouch researchers have laid bare the dna of a kangaroo species for the first time . newline_char this is only the third marsupial genome to be sequenced dr murchison told bbc news : " it 's always really valuable to look at an organism that is a bit different to understand how humans and other mammals have evolved . newline_char an international team of scientists , writing in the biomed central journal , genome biology , say they have even indentified a gene responsible for the kangaroo 's hop . newline_char professor marilyn renfree of the university of melbourne , a lead researcher on the project , said : " the tammar wallaby sequencing project has provided us with many possibilities for understanding how marsupials are different from us . newline_char " it was a very early conceived genome project and it has evolved through various different stages as genome sequencing technologies have changed a lot . newline_char " this is the first genome project to be led by australian scientists , " commented dr murchison . newline_char the researchers also studied the way tammar wallaby genes are turned " on " or " off " at different stages of the animal 's life cycle and in different parts of the body .
