tor george takei took to his facebook page thursday night to explain what he meant by calling supreme court justice clarence thomas a “ clown in blackface , ” saying the term was “ theater lingo ” that “ is not racist. newline_char ” a few fans have written wondering whether i intended to utter a racist remark by referring to justice thomas as a “ clown in blackface. newline_char the people who took offense to your comments knew exactly what blackface is , and the entire ugly racist history behind it . newline_char so blackface “ is not racist , ” but “ is instead part of a racist history in this country. newline_char no , no one cared if you “ intended to utter a racist remark. newline_char ” they cared that you uttered a racist remark . newline_char in traditional theater lingo , and in my view and intent , that is not racist . newline_char it is instead part of a racist history in this country . newline_char of course , i suspect that if someone tried to erase george takei ’ s entire racial ( or sexual ) identity in retaliation for an unpopular view he held , he ’ d have a slightly different take on the matter . newline_char i feel justice thomas has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings . newline_char the outrage stemmed not from the fact that you intended to be racist , but that you seem so utterly clueless that what you were saying was unacceptable . newline_char he understands what it ’ s like to live under the thumb of a racist , oppressive government . newline_char ” takei had several hours to look up and read thomas ’ dissent to know that he was intentionally taken out of context .
