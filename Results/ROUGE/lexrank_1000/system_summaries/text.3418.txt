the chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small , so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing , " said co-author dr alex liu of cambridge 's department of earth sciences , who was one of brasier 's phd students in oxford at the time that studies of the fossil began . newline_char credit : jamie hiscocks an unassuming brown pebble , found more than a decade ago by a fossil hunter in sussex , has been confirmed as the first example of fossilised brain tissue from a dinosaur . newline_char credit : university of manchester according to the researchers , the reason this particular piece of brain tissue has been so well-preserved is that the dinosaur 's brain was essentially 'pickled ' in a highly acidic and low-oxygen body of water - similar to a bog or swamp - shortly after its death . newline_char the fossilised brain , found by fossil hunter jamie hiscocks near bexhill in sussex in 2004 , is most likely from a species similar to iguanodon : a large herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the early cretaceous period , about 133 million years ago . story_separator_special_tag researchers say they 've found a bit of fossilized dinosaur brain enlarge this image toggle caption jamie hiscocks/university of cambridge jamie hiscocks/university of cambridge a rusty-brown rock found on a beach by a fossil hunter might contain a bit of preserved dinosaur brain . newline_char hiscocks showed his unusual fossil to martin brasier of the university of oxford , who was the first to recognize that it might contain preserved brain tissue . newline_char what 's different about this particular example , liu says , is that the outer millimeter or so of this fossil " is actually mineralization of some of the soft tissue structures that were preserved before they decayed away within the original dinosaur brain case . newline_char " there 's a series of bumps to this specimen that are quite characteristic of it fitting into the brain case of a dinosaur .
