is water exists because geothermal heat flow from below , coupled with pressure , movement , and the insulating nature of the ice sheet above , is great enough to maintain some areas at the base of the ice sheet above the freezing point , even in the extreme cold of antarctica . newline_char this season our target is the grounding zone , where the massive west antarctic ice sheet atop land meets the ross sea . newline_char subglacial aquatic environments over the last several decades , by using ground penetrating radar and other remote sensing tools , scientists have discovered that under the massive antarctic ice sheets there lies a vast hydrological system of liquid water . newline_char if the grounding zone is retreating or primed to retreat , rapid changes in ice behavior could follow over the next century . newline_char we will deploy all of the wissard tools during this period and recover sediment and water samples from the water cavity some 750 meters below the surface of the ice . newline_char wissard in order to explore one of these hydrological systems at the margin of the west antarctic ice sheet , we have organized an interdisciplinary project to access the subglacial environment . newline_char radar and seismic equipment is used to profile the overlying ice sheet and the underlying water , sediments , and rock , while gps stations accurately track ice movement . newline_char the work will help scientists assess the stability of the west antarctic ice sheet , most of which sits below sea level . story_separator_special_tag tomorrow 's edition of the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of microorganisms living far beneath antarctic ice . newline_char special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet , where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years . story_separator_special_tag
