ur patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , two of them in permanent completely locked-in state and two entering the completely locked-in state without reliable means of communication , learned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions requiring a “ yes ” or “ no ” by using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fnirs . newline_char if replicated with als patients in clis , these positive results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete locked-in states , at least for als . newline_char brain–computer interfaces based on neuroelectrical technology ( like an electroencephalogram ) have failed at providing patients in a completely locked-in state with means to communicate . newline_char these results are , potentially , the first step towards abolition of completely locked-in states , at least for patients with als . story_separator_special_tag using a device which detects patterns in brain activity , patients paralysed by als can answer ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ – and tell doctors they are ‘ happy ’ with life doctors have used a brain-reading device to hold simple conversations with “ locked-in ” patients in work that promises to transform the lives of people who are too disabled to communicate . newline_char illustration : wyss center , www.wysscenter.ch “ this is the first time we ’ ve been able to establish reliable communication with these patients and i think that is important for them and their families , ” he added . newline_char the groundbreaking technology allows the paralysed patients – who have not been able to speak for years – to answer “ yes ” or “ no ” to questions by detecting telltale patterns in their brain activity . newline_char “ it ’ s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever , because with all of these patients , we can now ask them the most critical questions in life , ” said niels birbaumer , a neuroscientist who led the research at the university of tübingen .
