date ( james joyner ) : taegan goddard summarizes a cnn survey of republicans in three early states : iowa : romney 21 % , huckabee 21 % , palin 18 % , gingrich 7 % new hampshire : romney 39 % , gingrich 19 % , palin 18 % , huckabee 11 % south carolina : palin 25 % , huckabee 24 % , romney 21 % , gingrich 20 % i agree with doug that these mostly measure name recognition and have little bearing on what will happen more than a year from now . newline_char at this point , of course , these polls are little more than a popularity and name recognition contest , and palin , romney , and huckabee have been leading the field in these polls for months now . newline_char on the republican side , it ’ s a dead heat between the ex-governors – mitt romney of massachusetts , mike huckabee of arkansas and sarah palin of alaska , according to a new rasmussen reports national telephone survey of likely gop primary voters . newline_char romney , huckabee , palin lead gop field for 2012 despite votes in the 2010 contest still being counted , polls for 2012 are already pouring out . newline_char asked who they would vote for if the republican presidential primary were held today , 20 % say romney , 19 % huckabee and another 19 % palin . newline_char i can ’ t imaging huckabee beating palin , although he has a track record of hanging around long after his defeat is inevitable and could serve as a spoiler . newline_char my gut tells me that romney is the frontrunner and palin the strongest challenger . newline_char ( … ) rounding out the list of seven candidates chosen by rasmussen reports for the question , with their levels of support , are former house speaker newt gingrich ( 13 % ) , minnesota governor tim pawlenty ( 6 % ) , texas congressman ron paul ( 5 % ) and indiana governor mitch daniels ( 3 % ) .
