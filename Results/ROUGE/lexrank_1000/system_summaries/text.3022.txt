new look at old ice the ancient soil was pulled from beneath the greenland ice sheet in 1993 , during the gisp2 deep-drilling project to reach the bedrock beneath summit . newline_char buried thousands of feet under summit , the highest point on greenland 's ice sheet , is a soil born before humans ever walked on earth . newline_char [ in photos : see greenland 's ancient landscape ] " there was a really stable landscape on greenland before the ice sheet came , " said lead study author paul bierman , a geomorphologist at the university of vermont . newline_char if the soil under summit has been buried for 2.7 million years , then the discovery implies the ice sheet has never fully melted , even when the earth went through an incredible natural warming swing 130,000 years ago â€” one as warm as this century 's predicted climate change . story_separator_special_tag soil frozen for 2.7 million years beneath the greenland ice sheet has provided clues about its history . newline_char study co-author dylan rood , from the scottish universities environmental research centre and the university of california , santa barbara , added : " the ancient soil under the greenland ice sheet helps to unravel an important mystery surrounding climate change . newline_char " findings suggest that even during the warmest periods of history , the ice sheet at the centre of greenland remained frozen , meaning the land has stayed hidden and unchanged for millions of years . newline_char " we found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet for 2.7 million years , " research paul bierman said . newline_char " the beryllium concentrations could only have been found in soils that have developed over hundreds of thousands of years , if not millions : " the soil had been stable and exposed at the surface for somewhere between 200,000 and one million years before being covered by ice , " said ben crosby , a member of the research team from idaho state university .
