 was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as alzheimer 's or parkinson 's . newline_char although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice , including weight loss and mild diabetes , which was caused by damage to the pancreas , professor mallucci said it would “ not be impossible ” to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been “ very promising ” . newline_char in mice with prion 's disease , it restored proteins to protect brain cells “ stopping the disease in its tracks ” , restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss . newline_char without these proteins to protect them , brain cells die off - leading to the symptoms of diseases like alzheimer 's . newline_char “ it 's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease . newline_char ” in debilitating brain diseases like alzheimer 's , the production of new proteins in the brain is shut down by a build-up of “ misfolded proteins ” or amyloids . story_separator_special_tag professor roger morris , from king 's college london , said : " this is the first convincing report that a small drug , of the type most conveniently turned into medicines , stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found , for instance , in alzheimer 's disease . newline_char lead scientist professor giovanna mallucci , from the mrc toxicology unit , said : " we were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells , restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice .
