 the study , nurses who largely stuck to eating a mediterranean diet had longer , healthier telomeres . story_separator_special_tag therefore , the main objective of this study was to examine the association between greater adherence to the mediterranean diet and leukocyte telomere length in us women within the nurses ’ health study cohort . newline_char given that fruits , vegetables , and nuts , key components of the mediterranean diet , have well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects , and that telomere length is affected by both of these processes , we hypothesized that greater adherence to the mediterranean diet would be associated with longer telomere length . newline_char least squares mean telomere length z scores were −0.038 ( se 0.035 ) for the lowest mediterranean diet score groups and 0.072 ( 0.030 ) for the highest group ( p for trend=0.004 ) . newline_char 10 11 telomere length is considered to be a biomarker of aging ; shorter telomeres are associated with a decreased life expectancy and increased rates of developing age related chronic diseases . newline_char conclusion in this large study , greater adherence to the mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres . newline_char results greater adherence to the mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres after adjustment for potential confounders . story_separator_special_tag the study , published in the journal bmj , controlled for body mass index , smoking , physical activity , reproductive history and other factors , and found that the higher the score for adherence to the diet , the longer the telomeres . newline_char they found that the diet was associated with longer telomeres , the protective structures at the end of chromosomes . newline_char the difference in telomere length for each point on the adherence scale , the researchers estimate , was equivalent to an average one and a half years of life .
