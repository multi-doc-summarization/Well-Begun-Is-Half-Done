 wednesday , researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered , the remains of bacteria thriving on earth not long , geologically speaking , after the very birth of the planet . newline_char william schopf , a paleontologist at the university of california , los angeles , and his colleagues found what that they , too , argued were the world ’ s oldest fossils : chainlike blobs in 3.46 billion-year-old rocks made , they said , by bacteria . newline_char other researchers later argued that the structures were just oddly shaped minerals . newline_char they are microscopic artwork : tiny tubes and long filaments , strange squiggles etched into some of the most ancient rocks known . story_separator_special_tag now , a new study led by university college london phd student matthew dodd describes evidence of what the researchers believe to be seafloor bacteria that lived at least 3.7 billion years ago . newline_char if the researchers are right about what they ’ ve found , this would be the oldest direct evidence of life we ’ ve ever seen . newline_char the nuvvuagittuq rocks have proven hard to date , but they are known to be at least 3.77 billion years old , and could even be as old as 4.28 billion years—very early indeed , considering that our planet formed only a little over 4.5 billion years ago . newline_char of course , it ’ s best not to get too carried away in daydreams until we ’ re more certain about what the researchers have found in these canadian rocks . newline_char ” all this , the researchers say , is consistent with iron-oxidizing bacteria that we find at hydrothermal vents today , as well as slightly less ancient fossil examples . newline_char this is all further complicated by the fact that the nuvvuagittuq rocks were metamorphosed under high temperature and pressure about 2.7 billion years ago .
