tory_separator_special_tag there would be no lumos – the charity dedicated to closing child institutions and so-called orphanages – if there hadn ’ t first been this picture . newline_char most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them , or because of a lack of local education and health facilities , especially for children with special needs . newline_char the shocking truth is that the vast majority of these children have parents that could care for them . newline_char where there is investment in inclusive education and health , where vulnerable families receive support for poverty , employment and social and medical problems ; where there are fostering , adoption or other family-based care alternatives for children who can not be with their parents ; and where the culture of institutionalisation is replaced by one that prioritises keeping families together , children can thrive within their own families and communities . newline_char part of our work in lumos is to shed light on the lives of those millions of children separated from their families for reasons of poverty , disability and discrimination . newline_char a crucial point is that these dire effects apply to children from all kinds of institutions , including those that are well resourced . newline_char the minority who do not have parents , or for whom staying at home is not in their best interests , are often placed in institutions because there is no alternative . newline_char the issues they choose to fund , and the principles they promote , greatly influence what support is available to children and families . newline_char there is now a wealth of scientific proof that institutions cause children measurable and sometimes irreparable harm . newline_char the solution is no institutions . newline_char for children in institutions , life too often resembles the darkest of grimms ’ fairytales .
