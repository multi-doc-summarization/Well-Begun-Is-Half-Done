e current study was limited to associating neanderthal dna variants with physical traits ( phenotypes ) included in hospital billing codes , but there is a lot of other information contained in the medical records , such as lab tests , doctors ’ notes , and medical images , that capra is working on analyzing in a similar fashion . newline_char “ our main finding is that neanderthal dna does influence clinical traits in modern humans : we discovered associations between neanderthal dna and a wide range of traits , including immunological , dermatological , neurological , psychiatric and reproductive diseases , ” said john capra , senior author of the paper “ the phenotypic legacy of admixture between modern humans and neanderthals ” published in the feb. newline_char according to the researchers , the pattern of associations that they discovered suggest that today ’ s population retains neanderthal dna that may have provided modern humans with adaptive advantages 40,000 years ago as they migrated into new non-african environments with different pathogens and levels of sun exposure . newline_char ” now , the first study that directly compares neanderthal dna in the genomes of a significant population of adults of european ancestry with their clinical records confirms that this archaic genetic legacy has a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology . newline_char by comparing the two sets of data , they could test whether each bit of neanderthal dna individually and in aggregate influences risk for the traits derived from the medical records . newline_char the discovery spawned a number of hypotheses about the effects these genetic variants may have on the physical characteristics or behavior of modern humans , ranging from skin color to heightened allergies to fat metabolism…generating dozens of colorful headlines including “ what your neanderthal dna is doing for you ” and “ neanderthals are to blame for our allergies ” and “ did europeans get fat from neanderthals ? story_separator_special_tag
