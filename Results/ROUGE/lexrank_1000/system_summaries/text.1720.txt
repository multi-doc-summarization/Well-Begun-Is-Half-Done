uters/dan dry/university of chicago/handout via reuters a microbe that spewed humongous amounts of methane into earth ’ s atmosphere triggered a global catastrophe 252 million years ago that wiped out upwards of 90 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land vertebrates . newline_char “ i would say that the end-permian extinction is the closest animal life has ever come to being totally wiped out , and it may have come pretty close , ” said massachusetts institute of technology biologist greg fournier , one of the researchers . newline_char a fossil of a trilobite , a horsecrab-like creature that thrived in the seas for hundreds of millions of years before becoming one of many kinds of animals wiped out in a mass extinction that befell the planet 252 million years ago , is shown in this handout photo provided by the university of chicago march 31 , 2014 . story_separator_special_tag analysis of geological carbon deposits reveals a significant boost in levels of carbon-containing gases – either carbon dioxide or methane – at the time of the mass extinction . newline_char but volcanic eruptions alone could never have produced the amount of carbon laid down in rock sediments during this period , the researchers claim . newline_char climate-changing microbes may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history 252m years ago , scientists believe . story_separator_special_tag but now in a new analysis , researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology argue that the mass extinction event may have been instigated by microbes . newline_char it is the period when the greatest-ever extinction took place , killing 97 percent of all species . newline_char the end-permian extinction has generally been blamed on massive volcanic eruptions that took place at the same time . newline_char worst of all , it is the only known extinction event where even insects were n't spared .
