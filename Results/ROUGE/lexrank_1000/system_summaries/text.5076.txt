re , the patent application suggests a number of solutions : the movement of a weighted mass within the device ; aeroplane-like foils that extend out from the surface of the device ; and a thrust mechanism such as a small gas-propulsion device . newline_char the “ protective mechanism for an electronic device ” patent application says it aims to prevent some or all of the damage to any electronic device with a processor – such as a tablet or a laptop – but specifically mentions the iphone . newline_char the system needs a sensor to detect when the device is falling and how it is positioned relative to the ground , according to the website appleinsider.com . story_separator_special_tag here , the patent calls for a number of solutions , including the movement of a weighted mass within the device , a means to " grip a plug " to prevent a freefall , lift foils that can be extended out from the surface of a device , and a thrust mechanism such as a can of gas , among other countermeasures.basically , the sensor send signals to the processor , which determines if a device is in a freefall state . newline_char published by the u.s. patent and trademark office , apple 's " protective mechanism for an electronic device " patent filing looks to alleviate some or all of the damage when a device is accidentally dropped . newline_char statistics of various fall heights , speeds and other data can be stored on system memory to aid the processor in making a decision on how best to land the device.finally , the system requires a mechanism to either reorientate the device while in flight , or otherwise protect certain sensitive device components in the event of a fall . newline_char in order to lessen the blow , or avoid it entirely , the protective mechanism can substantially change the angular velocity , device positioning or device rotation.from the patent overview : alternative embodiments focus on using internal motors used to grasp onto inserted cables to break a fall , extend air foils or aerodynamic lift members , and retract vital parts like switches .
