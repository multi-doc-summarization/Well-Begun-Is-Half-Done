ory highlights a star system caught extraterrestrial intelligence experts ' attention in october after an unusual light pattern was observed after monitoring a space anomaly for two weeks , seti says it has not detected radio signals nasa says the star was likely surrounded by comets ( cnn ) an anomaly in deep space that has been the focus of speculation and observation for weeks over possible extraterrestrial life may have just been solved . newline_char but nasa says the kepler telescope only viewed the star in " visible light , " and in this case , they searched by infrared light . newline_char a research team from iowa state university looked at data from nasa 's spitzer space telescope , and found that the strange dips in light , which were initially theorized to be possible structures , were likely a " swarm of comets . newline_char " it 's possible that a family of comets is traveling on a very long , eccentric orbit around the star , " nasa said in a statement . story_separator_special_tag nasa 's kepler mission had monitored the star for four years , observing two unusual incidents , in 2011 and 2013 , when the star 's light dimmed in dramatic , never-before-seen ways . newline_char one way to learn more about the star is to study it in infrared light . newline_char something had passed in front of the star and blocked its light , but what ? story_separator_special_tag researchers at iowa state university think they 've found an explanation for the star 's weird behavior . story_separator_special_tag tiny dips in a star ’ s brightness can indicate a planet is passing in front of the star . newline_char those citizen scientists were highlighting measurements of star brightness recorded by nasa ’ s kepler spacecraft . newline_char so marengo and two other astronomers decided to take a close look at the star using data taken with the infrared array camera of nasa ’ s spitzer space telescope .
