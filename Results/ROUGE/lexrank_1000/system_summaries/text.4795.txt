ittka â€™ s team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward , but they can also learn this trick from other bees , even though they have no experience with such a task in nature . newline_char the only way the bumble bee could get the sugar water was to pull the flower out from under the table by tugging on the string . newline_char video of hints of tool use , culture seen in bumblebees the team put 110 bumble bees , one at a time , next to the table to see what they would do . story_separator_special_tag to test this prediction , we challenged bees ( colony 2 ) to access the reward when a string was attached to only a colorless inverted eppendorf cap containing sucrose solution ( materials and methods ) immediately after their initial stepwise training and then again after extensive experience with blue flowers and strings . newline_char in fact , experienced bees may not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward . newline_char the success of bees learning such a behavior raises the question about the mechanisms by which the demonstrators learned to pull the string . newline_char if so , we would expect bees not to move the string with their legs and fail at the task if the colored target stimulus is not present . newline_char without a colored stimulus , only 2 of 15 bees tested obtained the reward after their initial training . newline_char conversely , after 48 h of extensive training ( 20 instances of string pulling ) , 11 of the 15 foragers solved the task without feedback from the moving blue flower ( s5 video ) . story_separator_special_tag scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward , and then those bees spread the learned technique to others .
