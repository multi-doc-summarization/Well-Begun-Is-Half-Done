hunter stressed that the genetic markers – found only in the snakes ’ mitochondrial dna passed down through the maternal line – do not mean a new species of super-snake has suddenly been unleashed on the everglades . newline_char a genetic study has found that some specimens of the invasive reptile that has decimated local wildlife are a mixture of two asian species which could make it an even more formidable predator from carnivorous giant lizards to toxic climbing tree frogs , the florida everglades have become a haven to invasive species steadily destroying and devouring the flora and fauna of the state ’ s famed river of grass . newline_char sign up to receive the top us stories every morning instead , they were surprised to uncover “ a tangled family tree ” , the genetic signature of the indian rock python present in at least 13 snakes . newline_char “ when two species come together they each have a unique set of genetic traits and characteristics they use to increase their survival and their unique habitats and environments , ” said margaret hunter , a usgs research geneticist and the lead author of the report . story_separator_special_tag what started out as a straightforward genetic study of florida ’ s invasive python population has turned up a surprising plot twist : a small number of crossbred burmese and indian pythons with the potential to become a kind of everglades super snake . newline_char wilfredo lee ap “ if the indian pythons have a wider range , perhaps these everglades snakes now have that capability , ” said lead author and usgs geneticist margaret hunter . newline_char the study originally intended to look at the genetic make-up of south florida snakes to better understand how they spread and how to help control them . newline_char while the vast majority appeared to be closely related burmese pythons — imagine a family reunion packed with first and second cousins — 13 had genetic markers from indian pythons , a different species that unlike the swamp-loving burmese snake prefers high , dry ground .
