groundwater can and should be thought of as a very useful buffer to climate extremes , " gleeson told the thomson reuters foundation in a phone interview from canada . newline_char although water found closer to the surface is being renewed quicker than the water found deeper in the earth , it is more sensitive to contamination and climate change , but it can also serve to temper climate extremes , gleeson said . newline_char " since we now know how much groundwater is being depleted and how much there is , we will be able to estimate how long until we run out , " gleeson said . story_separator_special_tag " with the growing global demand for water -- especially in light of climate change -- this study provides important information to water managers and policy developers as well as scientists from fields such as hydrology , atmospheric science , geochemistry and oceanography to better manage groundwater resources in a sustainable way , he says . newline_char the volume of modern groundwater dwarfs all other components of the active water cycle and is a more renewable resource but , because it 's closer to surface water and is faster-moving than old groundwater , it 's also more vulnerable to climate change and contamination by human activities . newline_char old groundwater is found deeper and is often used as a water resource for agriculture and industry . newline_char young and old groundwater are fundamentally different in how they interact with the rest of the water and climate cycles . newline_char the report shows that less than six per cent of groundwater in the upper two kilometres of the earth 's landmass is renewable within a human lifetime . newline_char for the first time since a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the global volume of groundwater was attempted in the 1970s , an international group of hydrologists has produced the first data-driven estimate of the earth 's total supply of groundwater .
