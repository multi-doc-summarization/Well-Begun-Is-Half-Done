e procedure - based on a new in vitro fertilisation technique that incorporates dna from three parents - was necessary because the baby 's mother carries mitochondrial dna mutations for leigh syndrome , a fatal neurological disorder . newline_char the treatment , which seeks to avoid mothers passing defective mitochondrial dna to their offspring , was performed in mexico . story_separator_special_tag while most people with leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear dna , about 20 percent have a mutation in mtdna . newline_char most genes associated with leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria . newline_char however , some genes are found in dna in specialized structures in the cell called . newline_char in humans , most genes are found in dna in the cell 's , called nuclear dna . newline_char this type of dna is known as mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) . story_separator_special_tag a five-month-old boy is the first baby to be born using a new technique that incorporates dna from three people , new scientist can reveal . newline_char genes for the disease reside in dna in the mitochondria , which provide energy for our cells and carry just 37 genes that are passed down to us from our mothers . newline_char this is separate from the majority of our dna , which is housed in each cell ’ s nucleus . newline_char the boy ’ s mother carries genes for leigh syndrome , a fatal disorder that affects the developing nervous system . story_separator_special_tag alana saarinen is one of only 30 to 50 people in the world who have some mitochondria , and therefore a bit of dna , from a third person . newline_char except she 's not , because every cell in alana 's body is n't like mine and yours - alana is one of a few people in the world who have dna from three people . newline_char but they also contain a little bit of dna .
