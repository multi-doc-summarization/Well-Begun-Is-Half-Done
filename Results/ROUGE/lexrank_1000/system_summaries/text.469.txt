tory_separator_special_tag we retrospectively reviewed 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the national center for catastrophic sports injury research between 1982 and 1998 . newline_char all injuries occurred in male athletes at an average age of 17.5 years ; 31 were catastrophic head injuries and 1 was a thoracic spine fracture that resulted in paraplegia . newline_char the mechanism of injury in the remaining two athletes was unknown . newline_char the purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms of injury so that preventive strategies can be implemented . newline_char the authors discuss other rule and equipment changes that may help reduce the occurrence of future injuries . story_separator_special_tag the odds of injury were 2.7 ( 95 % ci , 1.1-7.1 ) times greater in vaulters with multiple prior injuries . newline_char forty-one percent of vaulters sustained injury , and there were 7.9 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures . newline_char injury incidence was reported as the proportion of injured vaulters and number of new injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures . newline_char thirty percent , including 83 % of low back injuries , occurred during the plant/takeoff phase of the vault . newline_char no head or neck injuries were reported . newline_char injuries were recorded in a standardized form to document diagnosis and event circumstances . newline_char purpose : to describe injury incidence , patterns , and risks in collegiate pole vaulters . newline_char abstract background : although pole vaulting has been a sanctioned collegiate event since the 1920s , little is known about the injury patterns observed in the sport . newline_char the low back was the most common injury location ( 16.7 % ) , followed by the hamstrings and lower leg ( 13.9 % each ) . newline_char overall , 60 % of injuries were to the lower extremities , 21 % to the upper extremities , and 18 % to the back .
