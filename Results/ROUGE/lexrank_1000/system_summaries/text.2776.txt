ey believe that the relationships this species of mosquito has with other mosquitoes have been oversimplified , meaning the insects could intermingle and cause other populations to deteriorate . newline_char a british biotechnology company called oxitec has genetically engineered a new breed of olive tree fly that could stop their natural counterparts from ravaging olive trees in spain . newline_char oxitec 's main focus for now is on the mosquitoes , but they have developed a few more bugs for different purposes , including one that can control populations of cotton-eaters . newline_char but oxitec ceo hadyn parry says that its method is much more practical and safe than , say , using insecticide . newline_char the scientists have engineered dengue-carrying mosquitoes around the city of mandacaru to produce offspring that will all die before they can reproduce . story_separator_special_tag to tackle this , oxitec , a biotech company based in oxford , uk , has submitted an application to the national biosafety commission in spain to release a small contingent of male gm olive flies , in what would be the first field trial of its kind in europe . newline_char the principle is almost the same as with the olive flies â€“ send out an army of male mosquitoes equipped with genes that prevent any offspring , male or female , from reaching breeding age . newline_char and in brazil , gm mosquitoes are already at large as part of the biggest project yet involving engineered insects . newline_char the main benefit of the gm insect method , says tony nolan from imperial college , london , is that it is " strictly species-specific " as the insects only seek out mates of the same species . newline_char the idea is that the male offspring inherit the lethal genes and continue to propagate them through the population , until the number of females dwindles to zero and the species crashes .
