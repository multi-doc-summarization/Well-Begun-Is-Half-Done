ltimore , june 2 ( upi ) -- a discrepancy between galactic distances in the infant universe and more modern measurements suggests the universe is expanding at a faster pace than previously predicted . newline_char the most recent calculation of the universe 's rate of expansion , called the hubble constant , is believed  newline_char " this surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " adam riess , an astronomer with the space telescope science institute and johns hopkins university , said in a news release . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag riess ' team made the discovery by refining the universe 's current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy , reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent . newline_char astronomers using nasa 's hubble space telescope have discovered that the universe is expanding 5 percent to 9 percent faster than expected . story_separator_special_tag measurements taken by hubble space telescope conflict with studies of radiation left over from big bang – fuelling theories of ‘ dark energy ’ and mystery particles the universe is expanding faster than anyone had previously measured or calculated from theory . newline_char nasa and the european space agency jointly announced the universe is expanding 5 % to 9 % faster than predicted , a finding they reached after using the hubble space telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond themilky way . newline_char the rate of expansion did not match predictions based on measurements of radiation left over from the big bang that gave rise to the known universe 13.8bn years ago . story_separator_special_tag the new numbers indicate that the rate of expansion of our universe ( the so-called “ hubble constant ” ) is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec .
