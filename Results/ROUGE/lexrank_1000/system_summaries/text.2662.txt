rm atlantic waters wage a new assault on arctic ice from below a new enemy is undermining ice floating on the arctic ocean : heat from below . newline_char sensors that have plumbed the depths of arctic seas since 2002 have found warm currents creeping up from the atlantic ocean and helping drive the dramatic retreat of sea ice there over the last decade . newline_char across the entirety of the arctic ocean , it ’ s disappearing at an eye-popping rate of 13 % per decade since satellite data was available . newline_char warm atlantic waters , delivered by an offshoot of the gulf stream , have long been known to prevent ice formation north of scandinavia , on the western side of the eurasian basin . newline_char the paper shows “ a massive shift ” in the behavior of the arctic ocean over a short time , says finlo cottier , a physical oceanographer with the scottish association for marine science in oban who was not part of the study team . newline_char deep below the arctic sits a ridge that splits the ocean roughly in half : the amerasian basin sits on the north american side , whereas the eurasian basin lies north of europe and most of asia . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag climate change is melting the sea ice so rapidly that parts of the arctic ocean are beginning to take on characteristics of the atlantic ocean . newline_char when healthy , the arctic ocean exhibits a surprisingly resolute system of stratification — thick layers of ice that provide a natural barrier to nutrient mixing , one of the hallmarks of an ocean like the atlantic . story_separator_special_tag there ’ s a cap of cold , less salty water that covers the eastern portion of the arctic ocean . newline_char new research sheds light on the latest example of the changes afoot , showing that parts of the arctic ocean are becoming more like the atlantic .
