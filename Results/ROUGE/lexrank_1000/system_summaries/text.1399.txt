age copyright getty images image caption as the oil and gas industry has expanded in parts of the us , so have the number of earthquakes massive injections of wastewater from the oil and gas industry are likely to have triggered a sharp rise in earthquakes in the state of oklahoma . newline_char sudden swarm there has been increasing evidence of links between the process of oil and gas extraction and earthquakes in states like arkansas , texas , ohio and oklahoma in recent years . newline_char image copyright cornell image caption there has been a significant increase in the number of tremors in central oklahoma since 2008 researchers have now linked this increase to a near doubling in the volumes of wastewater disposed of in the central oklahoma region between 2004 and 2008 . newline_char " there is a high ratio of water to oil , " said the study 's lead author dr katie keranen from cornell university . story_separator_special_tag in so doing the team determined that a relatively small number of wastewater injection sites used in oil drilling and fracking in oklahoma may have the ability after all to induce relatively strong earthquakes a long distance away , throughout the state . newline_char past research has shown that processes such as wastewater injection at oil drilling and fracking sites throughout the state could induce a small number of earthquakes but scientists have never been able to specifically link some of the more distant or stronger earthquakes with these sometimes faraway wastewater wells . newline_char but like the authors of the new paper , he , too , has found evidence linking the oklahoma quakes specifically to oil and gas activity . newline_char a study published today in science explains how wastewater injection sites—areas where toxic water left over from oil drilling and fracking processes is injected into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting freshwater—could be driving the sharp increase in the sometimes-disastrous earthquake events .
