there is essentially no reason to believe that they [ the hairs ] belong to a species other than the brown bear , " said one the new study 's researchers , eliécer gutiérrez , a postdoctoral fellow of evolutionary biology at the smithsonian 's national museum of natural history in washington , d.c. gutiérrez and a colleague re-examined a finding reported in 2014 in which geneticist bryan sykes and his colleagues looked at two hair samples from the himalayan region : one sample came from an aggressive animal walking on its hind legs that was shot by a hunter about 40 years ago in northern india ; the other had been found in bhutan in a high-altitude bamboo forest , according to that study , published in the journal the proceedings of the royal society b . newline_char it 's likely the hairs came from " a previously unrecognized bear species , " living in the himalayas , the researchers wrote in the study . newline_char after a genetic analysis , sykes ' team said they had linked the " yeti " hair samples to the jawbone of an ancient polar bear ( ursus maritimus ) that lived in norway . newline_char " we made this discovery that basically that fragment of dna is not informative to tell apart two species of bears : the brown bear and [ modern-day alaskan ] polar bear , " gutiérrez told live science . story_separator_special_tag among dr edwards ' previous work was an attempt to carry out dna analysis of a sample taken from bones of a polar bear washed into caves in north west scotland 18,000 years ago . newline_char image copyright thinkstock image caption it had been proposed that hairs said to be from the yeti matched the dna of ancient polar bears a theory that the mythical yeti is a rare polar bear-brown bear hybrid animal has been challenged . story_separator_special_tag
