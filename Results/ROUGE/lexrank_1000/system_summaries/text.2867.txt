cording to brandeis university , perlman is currently shopping his invention to wine bottle manufacturers who may adopt the idea . newline_char an extremely bright gentleman by the name of daniel perlman set his sights on improving the wine bottle , and seems to have succeeded wildly by inventing a wine bottle that doesn ’ t drip when pouring . newline_char perlman , an inventor and patent holder who also happens to be a biophysicist at brandeis university , studied how wine hugs the edge of bottle spouts after being poured . newline_char the grooved tip is just two millimeters wide , but a video showing perlman ’ s alteration in action shows just how well it really works in comparison to the original , very basic wine bottle design . newline_char it typically results in wine running down the neck of the bottle and dripping onto whatever is beneath . newline_char instead of hugging the bottle , the wine fails to bridge the gap and simply falls directly into its intended vessel until it stops coming out entirely . story_separator_special_tag “ i wanted to change the wine bottle itself , ” perlman said . newline_char according to the school , the modern wine bottle design has been around since the 1800s , meaning it was ripe for innovation – and hopefully an end to 200 years of drips . newline_char for some reason , wine dripping down the side of the bottle when you pour it has become as accepted an inevitability as death and taxes ( both of which some people probably consider preferable to dripping wine ) . newline_char “ after many tests , perlman found the perfect width , roughly 2 millimeters , and depth , roughly 1 millimeter , for the groove so that the wine stream ca n't get passed it. newline_char however , in fixing the bottle itself , perlman does create one major hurdle to bringing his solution to the masses : unlike an accessory , which anyone can purchase , perlman ’ s innovation would have to be built-in by bottle manufacturers .
