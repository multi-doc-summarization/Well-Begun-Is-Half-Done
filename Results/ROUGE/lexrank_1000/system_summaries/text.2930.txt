vestigators at the march of dimes prematurity research center ohio collaborative looked at 3,485 nordic women and their babies , and found that maternal height , which is determined by genetic factors , helped shape the fetal environment , influencing the length of pregnancy and frequency of prematurity . newline_char new research has found that a mother 's height directly influences her risk for preterm birth . newline_char that a woman 's height influences gestational length , independent of the genes she passes on that determine fetal size , is a major finding by our research networks , and the first of what we expect to be many genetic contributions , " said joe leigh simpson , md , march of dimes senior vice president for research and global programs . newline_char " a major goal of the nationwide network of march of dimes prematurity research centers is identifying genes that govern fetal growth and length of pregnancy . newline_char more than 450,000 babies are born too soon in the u.s. and the national preterm birth rate is worse than many other high-resource countries , the march of dimes says . story_separator_special_tag in this study , we observed the consistent associations between maternal height and birth length , birth weight , and gestational age in each of the three study cohorts . newline_char the estimated effect sizes of the observed associations were respectively ~0.05 cm/cm for birth length , ~10 g/cm for birth weight , and ~0.34 d/cm for gestational age per 1 cm change in maternal height , which are in the same range as previous reports for fetal growth [ 20 ] and gestational age [ 15 ] . newline_char we observed significant associations of maternal height genetic score with birth length , with birth weight , and , to a lesser extent , with gestational age .
