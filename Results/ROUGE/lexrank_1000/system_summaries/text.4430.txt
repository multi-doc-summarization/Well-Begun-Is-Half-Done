christian charisius/european pressphoto agency ) a group of scientists says it has now reconstructed the history of the planet ’ s sea levels arcing back over some 3,000 years — leading it to conclude that the rate of increase experienced in the 20th century was “ extremely likely ” to have been faster than during nearly the entire period . story_separator_special_tag sea level then increased for 400 y at a rate of 0.6 mm/y , followed by a further period of stable , or slightly falling , sea level that persisted until the late 19th century . newline_char since then , sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.1 mm/y , representing the steepest century-scale increase of the past two millennia . story_separator_special_tag skip ad x embed x share sea level rise is one of the most visible ramifications of global warming and new research published on monday now shows the startling present-day impacts of global warming-related sea level rise . newline_char ( photo : joe raedle , getty images ) sea levels rose faster in the past century than during the previous 27 centuries due to man-made global warming , a pair of studies published monday found . story_separator_special_tag so far as i know , until now , no study has extended the links all the way from burning fossil fuels , to global warming , to sea level rise , to coastal floods that were caused unambiguously by us . newline_char sea level change has a dizzying array of causes , not just global warming . newline_char the link to sea level rise is clear . story_separator_special_tag significance we present the first , to our knowledge , estimate of global sea-level ( gsl ) change over the last ∼3,000 years that is based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions .
