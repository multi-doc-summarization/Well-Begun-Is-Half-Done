esident barack obama 's convention speech ranks as the shortest acceptance speech by an incumbent in 36 years . newline_char while it was roughly 26 minutes shorter than the record-holder since 1972 — bill clinton 's long-winded 1996 speech — obama still fell short of mitt romney 's mark . newline_char according to c-span research , obama 's speech clocked in at 38 minutes and 23 seconds , the briefest nomination acceptance speech by a president since gerald ford in 1976 . story_separator_special_tag if we had a category between winning and losing -- we do n't -- that 's where obama 's speech would fall . newline_char his speech was certainly not among the best he has ever delivered -- the # 1 seed in those rankings is his 2007 iowa jefferson-jackson dinner address -- and , at times , it felt more like a state of the union address than a convention acceptance speech . newline_char the speech will certainly send convention-goers back to their home states excited about the final 60 days of the campaign and there were enough appeals to the political center to make the case that obama is the right home for them . story_separator_special_tag he gave the fourth best speech of the democratic convention , and the three better ones—bill clinton ’ s , michelle obama ’ s , and ( rather surprisingly , at least for me ) joe biden ’ s—weren ’ t spectacular . newline_char the president ’ s convention speech was never going to be a make-or-break moment for him in this campaign : people already have an opinion of him , they basically know his pitch , and unless he planned to offer a major new proposal or argument it wouldn ’ t have been easy for him to move anyone with his convention closer .
