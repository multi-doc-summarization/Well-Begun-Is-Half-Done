study of the technology showed it accurately spotted alzheimer 's in blood samples from six people with the disease , thomas kodadek of the scripps research institute in jupiter , florida , wrote on thursday in the journal cell . newline_char * technology spotted antibodies for disease in blood * findings need to be confirmed by julie steenhuysen chicago , jan 6 ( reuters ) - u.s. researchers have developed a way to harness the immune system to test for alzheimer 's , an approach they say could lead to a blood test for the disease within months . newline_char they also used the test on blood from 200 elderly people not suffering from dementia and found 8 percent had elevated concentrations of the same antibodies found in alzheimer 's patients , which suggests the test may work as an early predictor of disease . story_separator_special_tag 6 ( healthday news ) -- a blood test that screens for antibodies , a protein produced by the immune system , may one day be used to detect alzheimer 's and other diseases , new research suggests . newline_char typically , in developing blood tests for diseases , researchers have searched for antigens -- that is , proteins from a virus , bacteria or other disease process such as cancer or neurological conditions like alzheimer 's -- that set off an immune response . newline_char though the research is still in its infancy , being able to detect alzheimer 's via antibodies would be a simpler and less invasive method of diagnosing the disease , researchers said . newline_char executive health early steps toward an alzheimer 's blood test different immune system proteins exist in the blood of people with the disease , study finds thursday , jan. newline_char but the study 's lead author stressed that the true benefits of such a test for alzheimer 's patients wo n't really arise until scientists develop effective treatments against the disease .
