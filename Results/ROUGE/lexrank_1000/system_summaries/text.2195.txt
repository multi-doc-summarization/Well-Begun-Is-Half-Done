we show that one of the very first modern humans that is known from europe had a neanderthal ancestor just four to six generations back in his family tree , " said geneticist svante pääbo of germany 's max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology . newline_char " he carries more neanderthal dna than any other present-day or ancient modern human seen to date . newline_char " modern humans arrive in europe after 43,000 years ago , and neanderthals went extinct by 39,000 years ago , " reich said . story_separator_special_tag in the new analysis , an international team of researchers , including pääbo and reich , found that 6 to 9.4 percent of oase 1 's nuclear dna ( located inside a cell 's nucleus ) was derived from neanderthals — a higher percentage than has been found in any other modern human genome sequenced so far . newline_char oase 1 lived sometime between 42,000 and 37,000 years ago , making him one of europe 's earliest modern humans . newline_char [ see photos of humanity 's closest relative ] dna extracted from the oase 1 jawbone showed one of its human ancestors interbred with a neanderthal . newline_char one of the earliest modern humans in europe had a surprisingly recent neanderthal ancestor , revealing the two species likely interbred there , according to a new study . newline_char evidence of interbreeding the new finding builds on work led by svante pääbo , of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , germany , and harvard university 's david reich , which , in 2010 , resulted in the first neanderthal genome ever sequenced . newline_char the large spans of neanderthal-like segments in oase 1 's genome indicate that one of his human ancestors interbred with a neanderthal less than 200 years before he lived .
