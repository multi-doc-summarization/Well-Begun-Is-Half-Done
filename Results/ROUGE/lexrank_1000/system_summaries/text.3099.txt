though multiple studies have identified risk factors for the development of escc , notably , exposure to alcohol and tobacco , this research is the first meta-analysis to look at the interaction between alcohol and tobacco in the risk of escc , a class of esophageal cancer that begins in the flat cells lining the esophagus . newline_char " our study suggests that not only do alcohol and tobacco play an important role in the development of esophageal cancer , the combination of their use markedly increases their potency as carcinogens . newline_char " our systematic review confirmed the expected exposure-dependent relationship of both alcohol and tobacco with the risk of escc , as alcohol use and tobacco use were both independent risk factors for the development of escc , " stated dr. story_separator_special_tag in a study of young danes on holiday , almost a third of those who consumed at least 12 units of alcohol ( roughly equivalent to four pints of lager or four 250ml glasses of wine ) avoided hangovers . newline_char the higher the alcohol content , and the faster you drink it , the worse the hangover . newline_char they drank anything between three and six drinks , however much was enough to give them a concentration of 0.11g of alcohol per 100ml of breath . newline_char a review of previous research published in 2000 confirms that the causes of the main symptoms of hangovers are dehydration , changes in the levels of hormones such as aldosterone and cortisol , and the toxic effects of alcohol itself . newline_char to find out the effect of these substances on hangover severity , researchers in the us recruited university students who were regular drinkers , without alcohol problems . newline_char mixing drinks needn â€™ t necessarily increase the overall amount of alcohol consumed , but it may do with cocktails .
