ientists have found a new virus that can be transmitted by blood transfusions and other blood-based products . newline_char ” then they looked at samples from 106 people in another study , and found the virus in two more people . newline_char now that the genetic sequence of this new virus is published , lipkin said , other scientists can start looking for it . newline_char it looks a little like the hepatitis c virus , which can cause permanent liver damage , and a little like the human pegivirus , which appears to be harmless , the team reports in the journal mbio . newline_char both patients appear to have " cleared " the virus and there is no evidence it caused any disease . newline_char “ we have been able to find a new virus . newline_char “ we really don ’ t know if there is ongoing transmission of this virus . story_separator_special_tag based on later blood samples that were analyzed , both of these people subsequently cleared the virus , the team reports online today in mbio . newline_char that ’ s the emphatic message coming from researchers who have discovered a new virus in human blood . newline_char as part of a search for novel human viruses , the group scoured blood samples from a cohort of 46 people that were collected before and after they received a blood transfusion between 1974 and 1980 . newline_char although contamination frequently upends the supposed discovery of a new virus , hhpgv-1 looks real , says michael houghton , a virologist at the university of alberta in edmonton who helped identify the viral cause of hepatitis c. newline_char the newfound virus ’ s genetic sequence shows that it has similarities to hepatitis c , which can cause serious liver damage , and to the harmless—and even helpful—human pegivirus ( formerly dubbed hepatitis g ) .
