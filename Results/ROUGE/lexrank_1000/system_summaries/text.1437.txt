tory_separator_special_tag " and even if quarks and electrons are indivisible , parker said , scientists do n't know if they are the smallest bits of matter in existence , or if the universe contains objects that are even more minute . newline_char " my guess is that [ black hole singularities ] are quite a lot smaller than a quark , but i do n't believe they 're of infinite density , " parker told livescience . newline_char the planck length superstrings , singularities , and even grains of the universe could all turn out to be about the size of the " planck length . newline_char " perhaps all of the universe 's smallest things are roughly the size of the planck length . newline_char in that case , two particles would n't be able to come infinitely close to each other because they would always have to be separated by the minimum size of a grain of space . newline_char according to the uncertainty principle , no instrument should ever be able to measure anything smaller , because at that range , the universe is probabilistic and indeterminate . newline_char these too , seemed like fundamental particles , before scientists discovered that protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each . newline_char in experiments , teensy , tiny particles like quarks and electrons seem to act like single points of matter with no spatial distribution . newline_char black holes are formed when matter is condensed in a small enough space that gravity takes over , causing the matter to pull inward and inward , ultimately condensing into a single point of infinite density . newline_char [ graphic : nature 's tiniest particles ] parker , a professor of high-energy physics at england 's cambridge university , recently hosted a television special on the u.k. newline_char one contender for the smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole .
