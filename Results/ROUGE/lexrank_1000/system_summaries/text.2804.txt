her snakes would take up similar hunting positions as dawn approached , catching the bats as they returned . newline_char dinets considered that the snakes might all just prefer the same areas of the passage , but no snake chose the same segment twice during the entire study , suggesting coordination , not similar taste in locale . newline_char “ visual observations suggested that most bats were able to avoid flying near boas when there were one or two boas present , but with three boas present the bats had to fly either within striking distance from one of them ( often colliding with the boas ) or very low above the passage floor , ” dinets explained in the paper . newline_char ” after 8 days of records , dinets concluded the snakes coordinated their hunts , and published his results in the animal behavior and cognition . newline_char while the snakes coordinated with one another , it ’ s not quite accurate to say they hunted in a “ pack ” like wolves , as that implies a social aspect that dinets didn ’ t see . newline_char vladimir dinets , a research assistant professor at the university of tennessee , knoxville , was guiding a bird- and mammal-watching tour through desembarco del granma national park , cuba , when he first noticed the cavern-hunting snakes . story_separator_special_tag he found that if more than one boa was present , the snakes coordinated their positions in such a way that they formed a wall across the entrance . newline_char to date , only a handful of snakes have been observed to hunt in groups , and coordination among them—or among any other group-hunting reptiles—has never been proven , dinets said . newline_char dinets noticed that the boas hung down from the ceiling of the cave entrance and grabbed passing bats in midair . newline_char such group hunts were always successful , and the more snakes were present , the less time it took each to capture a bat .
