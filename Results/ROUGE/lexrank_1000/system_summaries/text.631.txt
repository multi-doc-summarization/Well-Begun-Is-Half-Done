 the united states , youth have the highest burden of nonfatal self-inflicted injury ( ie , deliberate physical harm against oneself , inclusive of suicidal and nonsuicidal intent ) requiring medical attention.1 one study found that emergency department ( ed ) visits for these injuries during the 1993 to 2008 period varied by age group , ranging from 1.1 to 9.6 per 1000 ed visits , with adolescents aged 15 to 19 years exhibiting the highest rates.1 self-inflicted injury is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide—the second-leading cause of death among those aged 10 to 24 years during 2015.2 this study examined trends in nonfatal self-inflicted injuries treated in hospital eds among us children , adolescents , and young adults aged 10 to 24 years ( hereafter referred to as youth ) . newline_char trends in self-inflicted injury ed visit rates were assessed using joinpoint regression software ( surveillance research program , national cancer institute ) , version 4.3.1.0 . newline_char self-inflicted injury ed visit rates were calculated from 2001 through 2015 by sex , age ( 10-14 , 15-19 , and 20-24 years ) , along with injury method ( poisoning , sharp object , blunt object ) , and 95 % cis using us census population estimates as denominators . newline_char overall age-adjusted rates for females demonstrated no statistically significant trend before 2009 , yet increased 8.4 % ( 95 % ci , 5.6 % -11.2 % ) yearly from 2009 to 2015 . story_separator_special_tag older teen girls had the highest rates — 633 visits per 100,000 in 2015 , but the increase after 2008 was less steep . newline_char nearly 29,000 girls with self-inflicted injuries and about 14,000 boys were treated in emergency rooms during the study years . newline_char rates in girls were also stable until around 2008 .
