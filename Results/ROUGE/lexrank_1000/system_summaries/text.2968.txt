at means that some of our water must predate the sun , when heavy hydrogen was in abundance . newline_char scientists know that water accompanied the sun ’ s birth but wondered if it might have been destroyed in the process of the sun ’ s formation , leaving earth to go it alone in stirring up its own water . newline_char “ by identifying the ancient heritage of earth ’ s water , we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique , and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water , ” said tim harries , a professor at the university of exeter ’ s physics and astronomy department , in england , and an author of the paper , in a statement . newline_char to find out if the water from that dust cloud made it to earth , researchers measured the ratio of deuterium , or heavy hydrogen to hydrogen . newline_char or did water come later , forming as the earth also formed ? newline_char life on earth owes everything to the presence of liquid water here , but , even so , scientists don ’ t have definitive answers for how or when the water got here — or , for that matter , when the water itself was formed . newline_char up to about half of the water on our planet is older than the sun , according to a paper published on thursday in the journal science . newline_char so , if water can survive a star ’ s birthing process , and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did , that means that water might be a common ingredient in the making of other planets far from our own . story_separator_special_tag water with a high deuterium content can only form under specific conditions . newline_char over the past several decades , researchers have come up with two possible — and competing — explanations of how this heavy water took up residence in our solar system .
