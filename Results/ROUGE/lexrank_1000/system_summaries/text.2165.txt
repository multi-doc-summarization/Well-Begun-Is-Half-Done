rlier this year , mitt romney nearly landed in a politically perilous controversy when the huffington post reported that in 1999 the gop presidential candidate had been part of an investment group that invested $ 75 million in stericycle , a medical-waste disposal firm that has been attacked by anti-abortion groups for disposing aborted fetuses collected from family planning clinics . newline_char the stericycle deal—the abortion connection aside—is relevant because of questions regarding the timing of romney ’ s departure from the private equity firm he founded . newline_char but documents filed by bain and stericycle with the securities and exchange commission—and obtained by mother jones—list romney as an active participant in the investment . newline_char responding to a recent washington post story reporting that bain-acquired companies outsourced jobs , the romney campaign insisted that romney exited bain in february 1999 , a month or more before bain took over two of the companies named in the post ‘ s article . newline_char and this deal helped stericycle , a company with a poor safety record , grow , while yielding tens of millions of dollars in profits for romney and his partners . story_separator_special_tag there is no publicly available data showing that either romney or other officials at bain knew of stericycle 's work with planned parenthood and abortion clinics before the investment . newline_char but at a time when romney is attempting to sell south carolina voters on his pro-life record -- running values-themed radio ads and defending himself from attacks that say he governed as pro-abortion lawmaker -- the link between stericycle and bain could still cause him problems . newline_char by the time bain capital had made the investment in stericycle , he had left the firm to run the 2002 winter olympic games . newline_char he maintained ownership in bain and kept holdings in its private equity funds , which included stericycle stock , but he had no say in the managerial or strategic decisions at the firm , according to bain officials .
