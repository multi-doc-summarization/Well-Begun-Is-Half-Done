is study included only women who did not peel their apples before eating them , but the researchers speculate that it " might be interesting to evaluate " whether apple peels play a more specific role in female sexuality . newline_char according to a recent study in archives of gynecology and obstetrics , women who consume apples on a regular basis tend to experience greater overall sexual function , reporting higher levels of arousal and satisfaction . newline_char it 's also possible that the sexual health benefits come more from apple peels -- which have high concentrations of helpful phenolic compound -- than from the apples themselves . newline_char the women were classified into two groups -- those who ate one to two apples daily and those who ate none -- and asked to fill out the female sexual function index ( fsfi ) , which includes more than a dozen questions regarding desire , arousal , lubrication , orgasm , satisfaction and pain . story_separator_special_tag the researchers hypothesize that apples may improve sexual function because , like red wine and chocolate , they contain polyphenols and antioxidants that can stimulate blood flow to the genitalia and vagina , thus helping with arousal . newline_char researchers found that " daily apple use is associated with higher fsfi scores in sexually active female patients , thus increasing their lubrication and overall sexual function . newline_char participants were separated into two groups : regular apple consumption ( one to two apples a day ) and no apple consumption ( 0 to 0.5 apples per day ) . story_separator_special_tag introduction : even if some evidence exists of a positive correlation between regular intake of phytoestrogens , polyphenols , antioxidants and women 's sexual health , there is not a study addressing the potential correlation between daily apple consumption and women 's sexual function .
