e pair used a hefty data set from facebook as their lab : 1.3 million facebook users , selected randomly from among all users who are at least 20 years old , with from 50 to 2,000 friends , who list a spouse or relationship partner in their profile . newline_char instead , it seems , the shape of a person ’ s social network is a powerful signal that can identify one ’ s spouse or romantic partner — and even if a relationship is likely to break up . newline_char their dispersion algorithm was able to correctly identify a user ’ s spouse 60 percent of the time , or better than a 1-in-2 chance . newline_char high dispersion occurs when a couple ’ s mutual friends are not well connected to one another . story_separator_special_tag facebook data scientists have developed a novel method for identifying who among a user 's friends is that person 's partner—and their work puts an empirical stamp on something that is perhaps intuitive : a significant other occupies a unique place in a person 's social network , one characterized not by " embeddedness " —the standard way of measuring a tie 's proximity—but by what the researchers call " dispersion . newline_char using dispersion , backstrom and kleinberg doubled their accuracy : 50 percent of the time , a person was romantic partners with the person who was the most dispersed across his or her social network . newline_char the researchers were able to work with their findings to produce a telling observation about the health of a given relationship : the more dispersion a relationship demonstrated , the more likely it was that that relationship would still be around 60 days later ( the researchers excluded married couples from this analysis , though that would be quite interesting to see too ) .
