stead of counting lake by lake , earlier estimates were statistical guesses , based on the number of lakes in a parcel of land or on average lake size . newline_char one widely cited study from 2006 estimated the lake total at 304 million . newline_char " this study largely puts to rest the long-debated questions of 'how many lakes there are in the world and how much surface area do they cover ? newline_char until now , no one knew for sure how many lakes exist on earth . newline_char with high-resolution satellite data and supercomputers to check every cloudless pixel , researchers now have the best count yet of lakes on earth . newline_char " we knew there problems with the extrapolation methods used to fill the data gap for the small lakes , but previous estimates assumed we had a pretty good handle on the medium- to larged-sized ones , " he told live science in an email interview . newline_char " most lakes are in the far north , and there 's actually quite a few of them , " said seekell , a co-author of the new study . newline_char blame geography â€” most of the world 's lakes are in places where humans do n't live , said david seekell , an environmental scientist at umea university in sweden . newline_char yet the bodies of water cover more land ( 3.7 percent of earth 's surface ) than previous studies had predicted . story_separator_special_tag the nasa images show how by 2000 the lake was already a fraction of what it had been before the irrigation project started in the 1960s the images show how the smaller northern aral sea had separated from the southern aral sea , which itself had broken up into an eastern and a western lobe , the two sides still barely connected at both ends .
