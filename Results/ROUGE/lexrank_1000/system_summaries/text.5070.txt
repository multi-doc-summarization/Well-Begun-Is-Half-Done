ginning in the 1990s , piven and other researchers noticed that children with autism tended to have larger brains than developmentally normal children , suggesting that brain growth could be a biomarker for asd . newline_char but behavioural assessments have n't been helpful in predicting who will get autism , says joseph piven , a psychiatrist at the university of north carolina ( unc ) in chapel hill , who co-led the study , published online in nature1 . newline_char the findings raise the prospect of diagnosing autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) months before children develop symptoms , a goal that has proved elusive . story_separator_special_tag that overgrowth of the brain coincided with the behaviors typical of autism that start to emerge when the child reaches their second year , the researchers say . newline_char in what they say is a first-of-its-kind study , researchers used magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) to examine the brains of infants at high risk for autism – those whose older siblings had the disorder – at 6 months , 12 months , and 24 months of age . story_separator_special_tag images revealed which infants would go on to have an autism diagnosis , raising hopes for earlier care and interventions for those affected babies who are most at risk of developing autism as toddlers have been identified from brain scans in the first year of life . newline_char brain scans of premature babies reveal changes that may raise risk of autism read more scientists studied 106 babies , all of whom had an older brother or sister with autism , and found that telltale features in brain images taken at six and 12 months revealed which infants would go on to have an autism diagnosis . newline_char the images helped doctors spot which of a group of children who were already at risk because of autism in the family would later be diagnosed with the condition .
