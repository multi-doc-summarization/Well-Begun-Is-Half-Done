 a study recently published in the journal primates , jan van hooff and bas lukkenaar re-examine the events of april 10 , when a dutch tv crew was using a camera-equipped drone to film a documentary of chimpanzees at a 1.7-acre enclosure at the royal burgers zoo in arnhem . newline_char 1:32  the researchers note that tushi collected the stick before the drone approached , and carried it to a place where the drone might be swatted . newline_char as the drone got close , tushi swatted at it twice with a 6-foot-long branch she brandished in her left hand . newline_char remember the chimp at a dutch zoo who emphatically swatted a tv crew 's drone out of the sky with a tree branch ? story_separator_special_tag caption : a female chimpanzee named tushi uses a stick to “ attack ” the drone . newline_char tushi made two long sweeps with hers – the second was successful in downing the drone and ultimately broke it . newline_char the idea was to use a drone to film the chimpanzees in their compound from different close-up angles . newline_char the drone already caught the chimpanzees ’ attention during a practice run . newline_char according to van hooff and lukkenaar , the chimpanzees housed at the royal burgers zoo have never explicitly been taught how to use different tools , but have had ample chance to watch humans handle all kinds of implements . newline_char in an article in the journal primates published by springer , jan van hooff and bas lukkenaar explain it as yet another example of chimpanzees ’ make-do attitude to using whatever is on hand as tools . newline_char that ’ s how a chimpanzee living in the royal burgers ’ zoo in the netherlands set out to swat an aerial drone that was filming her group .
