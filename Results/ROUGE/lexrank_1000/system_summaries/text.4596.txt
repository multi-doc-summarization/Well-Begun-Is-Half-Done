r results showed significant positive associations of brain volume and iq ( r=.24 , r ( 2 ) =.06 ) that generalize over age ( children vs. newline_char we show that the strength of the positive association of brain volume and iq has been overestimated in the literature , but remains robust even when accounting for different types of dissemination bias , although reported effects have been declining over time . story_separator_special_tag for centuries , scientists have been investigating the link between human brain size and intelligence , with several studies suggesting inconclusively that the bigger the brain , the smarter a person . newline_char in this instance , researchers from austria , the netherlands , and germany compared iq test results to participants ' brain volumes , measured using brain imaging methods over multiple studies . newline_char to make up for that , scientists came up with a new way to measure brain size , known as the 'encephalisation quotient ' , which explains an animal 's brain size relative to the expected brain size in  newline_char " rather , brain structure and integrity appear to be more important as a biological foundation of iq , whilst brain size works as one of many compensatory mechanisms of cognitive functions . story_separator_special_tag " the presently observed association means that brain volume plays only a minor role in explaining iq test performance in humans . newline_char based on the data from 148 samples comprising over 8000 participants , they report a robust but weak association between brain size and iq . newline_char , mri , pet ) , reliable assessments of in-vivo brain volume and investigations of its association with iq are now possible . newline_char in a meta-analysis of data from more than 8000 participants , they show that associations between in-vivo brain volume and iq are small .
