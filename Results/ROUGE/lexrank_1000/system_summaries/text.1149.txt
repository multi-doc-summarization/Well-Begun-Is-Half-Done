scientists have long been able to reconstruct static photos and images from reading brain patterns , but this is believed to be a first for reading a dynamic visual experience . newline_char " in order for this technology to have wide applicability , we must understand how the brain processes these dynamic visual experiences . newline_char the mri machine recorded the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex , the part of the brain that processes visual information . story_separator_special_tag shinji nishimoto , a neuroscientist in gallant 's lab and the study 's lead author , said the results shed light on how the brain understands and processes visual experiences . newline_char " if you can decode movies people saw , you might be able to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog , like dreams , " gallant said . newline_char the team then used the brain imaging data to develop a computer model that matched features of the videos -- like colors , shapes and movements -- with patterns of brain activity . newline_char researchers from uc berkeley were able to reconstruct youtube videos from viewers ' brain activity -- a feat that might one day offer a glimpse into our dreams , memories and even fantasies . newline_char " once we had this model built , we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backwards through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw , " said gallant . newline_char subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain , measured by functional mri , predicted what was on the screen at the time -- whether it was steve martin as inspector clouseau or an airplane . newline_char the reconstructed videos are blurry because they layer all the youtube clips that matched the subject 's brain activity pattern .
