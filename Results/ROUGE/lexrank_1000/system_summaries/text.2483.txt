f researchers at eth zurich university took cues from the deadly beetle and built two chemical filled honeycomb chambers . newline_char taking design cues from mother nature herself , researchers are building atms that fend off thieves with a spray of hot , steaming foam . newline_char the oozing foam from the reaction will be laden with dye , marking the banknotes ( rendering them useless ) as well as the thieves themselves . newline_char the inspiration for this dastardly defense mechanism comes from none other than the bombardier beetle , which sprays near-boiling acid at any foes who coming knocking . story_separator_special_tag two separately stored chemicals are mixed in a reaction chamber in the beetle 's abdomen . newline_char he and his team therefore looked to the bombardier beetle for inspiration and developed a chemical defence mechanism designed to prevent vandalism – a self-defending surface composed of several sandwich-like layers of plastic . newline_char when threatened , the bombardier beetle releases a caustic spray , accompanied by a popping sound . newline_char the bombardier beetle inspired the researchers of eth zurich . newline_char the beetle produces the explosive agent itself when needed . newline_char ( photo : jayvee18 – fotolia ) its head and pronotum are usually rusty red , and its abdomen blue or shiny green : the bombardier beetle is approximately one centimetre long and common to central europe . story_separator_special_tag it ’ s my fault because i voted for clinton when she ran against sanders in the 2016 primary , and i didn ’ t tell anyone because again she was the unpopular choice . newline_char it ’ s my fault because i voted for clinton when she ran against obama in the 2008 primary , but i didn ’ t tell anyone because she was the unpopular choice . newline_char it ’ s my fault because during the long months of the primary and the general election i didn ’ t tell anyone how strongly i felt about clinton .
