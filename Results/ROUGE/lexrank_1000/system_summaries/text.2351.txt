th its a350 xwb jet , airbus integrates the latest design and engineering tricks to quell many of the headaches for flyers , carriers , and pilots . newline_char " the design process was about optimization , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program at airbus , says . newline_char with $ 15 billion worth of research and development under its belt , airbus is hoping that its no-nonsense approach to design and engineering will help it best the competition—namely the boeing 787 dreamliner and 777 long-distance planes . newline_char these measures—plus ultra-efficient rolls royce engines—result in fuel economy that airbus claims is 25 % better than similarly sized planes from competitors . newline_char the manufacturer debuted the design in early 2015 , but the first aircraft to land in the united states arrived courtesy of qatar airways last week . story_separator_special_tag larger and wider wings , together with flaps that follow the flight path direction rather than the wind , combine to create a 25 percent improvement in the plane 's fuel economy over comparable models currently in the sky , according to airbus . newline_char but commercial aircraft companies airbus and qatar airways think they might have found a solution to the perennial jetlag problem with their latest aeroplane . newline_char again , airbus says this should improve comfort for passengers and minimise the effects of jetlag once they step back onto the ground . newline_char if you find jetlag a particular problem when flying between countries , you might want to look out for the new plane in the airport schedules . newline_char the interior design of the cabin can be adapted by individual airlines , depending on how they want to make use of the space ( and how many business class passengers they 're expecting ) .
