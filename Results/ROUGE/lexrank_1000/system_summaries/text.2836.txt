 experiments involving a simulation of the human esophagus and stomach , researchers at mit , the university of sheffield , and the tokyo institute of technology have demonstrated a tiny origami robot that can unfold itself from a swallowed capsule and , steered by external magnetic fields , crawl across the stomach wall to remove a swallowed button battery or patch a wound . story_separator_special_tag " the origami capsule could be used to remove swallowed batteries from the stomach it 's also difficult to steer something precisely around the body using only external magnets , but rus had a relatively simple first task for the robot : removing a swallowed battery from the stomach . newline_char researchers from mit have designed a new ingestible " robot " that could one day be used to patch internal wounds , deliver medicine , or remove accidentally swallowed objects from the stomach . newline_char " for applications inside the body , we need a small , controllable , untethered robot system , " said rus in a press release . newline_char the researchers suggest that the origami meat robot could be deployed in these scenarios to find the magnet , pulling it free from the tissue and guiding it toward the colon for evacuation . story_separator_special_tag enlarge image melanie gonick/mit a pill that unfolds into a little robot could one day give parents everywhere a little more peace of mind . newline_char " for applications inside the body , we need a small , controllable , untethered robot system , " rus explained in a statement . newline_char developed by an international team of researchers from mit , the university of sheffield in the uk and the tokyo institute of technology in japan , the origami robot is the latest developed by mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory director daniela rus , who has been building and researching origami robots for years .
