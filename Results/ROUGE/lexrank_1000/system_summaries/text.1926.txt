 2016 an estimated 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 445,000 people died , mostly children in the african region . story_separator_special_tag differing levels of insecticide resistance between two african malaria vectors , anopheles coluzzii and anopheles gambiae , have been attributed to assortative mating between the two species . newline_char we report that during a recent period of hybridization between two major african malaria mosquitoes , anopheles gambiae and anopheles coluzzii , an island of divergence on chromosome 2 introgressed from the a. story_separator_special_tag disease burden in 2013 there were an estimated 198 million cases of malaria worldwide ( range 124–283 million ) in 2013 , and an estimated 584 000 deaths ( range 367 000–755 000 ) . newline_char 90 % of all malaria deaths occur in africa . newline_char between 2000 and 2013 , an expansion of malaria interventions helped to reduce malaria incidence by 30 % globally , and by 34 % in africa . newline_char during the same period , malaria mortality rates decreased by an estimated 47 % worldwide and by 54 % in africa . newline_char in high-risk areas , more than one malaria case occurs per 1000 population . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag interbreeding of two malaria mosquito species in the west african country of mali has resulted in a " super mosquito " hybrid that 's resistant to insecticide-treated bed nets . newline_char interbreeding of two malaria mosquito species in the west african country of mali has resulted in a " super mosquito " hybrid that 's resistant to insecticide-treated bed nets . newline_char " what we provide in this new paper is an example of one unusual mechanism that has promoted the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in one of the major malaria mosquito species . newline_char " anopheles gambiae , a major malaria vector , is interbreeding with isolated pockets of another malaria mosquito , a.
