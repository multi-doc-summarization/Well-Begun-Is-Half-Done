nce cases of rocky mountain spotted fever , which is spread by the lone star tick , also arise in the same southeastern region , researchers are pretty sure that it ’ s the tick bites that are causing the allergies to meat and cetuximab . newline_char mammal meat — pork and beef — contains a sugar called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose ( alpha-gal for short ) , and in people with the allergy , alpha-gal triggers an immune response that includes a massive release of histamines , much like your body would respond to other allergies . newline_char since cetuximab and mammal meat both contain alpha-gal , and the affected people ’ s blood contained alpha-gal antibodies , the researchers hypothesized that the sugar was behind the allergy . newline_char researchers don ’ t know exactly how the tick spreads the allergy , but they have identified which component of meat causes the allergic reaction . newline_char , identified the alpha-gal connection after examining blood work from people that experienced strange reactions not to meat but to a cancer drug called cetuximab . story_separator_special_tag he ’ d been hearing tales of the meat allergy since the ’ 90s—people waking up in the middle of the night after a big meal , sweating and breaking out in hives . newline_char in the last decade and a half , thousands of previously protein-loving americans have developed a dangerous allergy to meat . newline_char he discovered that all the patients who experienced an allergic reaction had pre-existing antibodies to alpha-gal , and cetuximab was full of the stuff , thanks to the genetically modified mice from which it was derived . newline_char for years , physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star tick calls home , namely the southeastern united states . newline_char scientists are racing to trace its spread , to understand if the lone star tick is expanding into new territories , or if other species of ticks are now causing the allergy .
