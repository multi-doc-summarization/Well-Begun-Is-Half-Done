mited evidence suggested swaddling risk increased with infant age and was associated with a twofold risk for infants aged > 6 months . newline_char study selection : observational studies that measured swaddling for the last or reference sleep were included . newline_char swaddling risk varied according to position placed for sleep ; the risk was highest for prone sleeping ( or , 12.99 [ 95 % ci , 4.14–40.77 ] ) , followed by side sleeping ( or , 3.16 [ 95 % ci , 2.08–4.81 ] ) and supine sleeping ( or , 1.93 [ 95 % ci , 1.27–2.93 ] ) . newline_char it has been reported that swaddling infants for sleep is gaining popularity in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states,1–3 with several reported benefits to the practice . newline_char abstract context : swaddling is a traditional practice of wrapping infants to promote calming and sleep . newline_char limitations : heterogeneity among the few studies available , imprecise definitions of swaddling , and difficulties controlling for further known risks make interpretation difficult . newline_char the overall age-adjusted pooled odds ratio ( or ) for swaddling in all 4 studies was 1.58 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.97–2.58 ) . story_separator_special_tag researchers pooled data from four observational studies of sids and swaddling that included 760 sids cases and 1,759 controls . newline_char photo swaddling a baby may increase the risk for sudden infant death syndrome , or sids , a new analysis concludes . newline_char the practice of swaddling — wrapping an infant with a light cloth , with the head exposed — has grown in the united states with reports that it promotes better sleep . story_separator_special_tag the researchers do suggest parents stop swaddling before a child turns six months old and should place a baby on its back to sleep .
