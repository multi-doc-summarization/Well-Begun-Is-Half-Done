rothy hall , who studies the surface temperature of greenland at nasa 's space flight centre in greenbelt , maryland , confirmed that the area experienced unusually high temperatures in mid-july , and that there was widespread melting over the surface of the ice sheet . newline_char " zwally , who has made almost yearly trips to the greenland ice sheet for more than three decades , said he had never seen such a rapid melt . newline_char scientists attributed the sudden melt to a heat dome , or a burst of unusually warm air , which hovered over greenland from 8 july until 16 july . story_separator_special_tag [ giant ice : photos of greenland 's glaciers ] instruments on two other satellites proved out nghiem 's findings — the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer ( modis ) on nasa 's terra and aqua satellites data from the special sensor microwave imager/sounder on a u.s. air force meteorological satellite also confirmed the mind-blowing melt . newline_char extent of surface melt over greenland ’ s ice sheet on july 8 ( left ) and july 12 ( right ) based on data from three satellites . newline_char that 's a record for the largest area of surface melt on greenland in more than 30 years of satellite observations , according to nasa and university scientists . newline_char digirolamo , ssai/nasa gsfc , and jesse allen , nasa earth observatory nghiem had reason to be baffled , as this record ice-melt is well above average : about half of greenland 's surface ice tends to melt every summer , with the meltwater at higher elevations quickly refreezing in place and the coastal meltwater either pooling on top of the ice or draining into the sea . newline_char the images , snapped by three satellites , showed that about 40 percent of the ice sheet had thawed at or near the surface on july 8 ; just days later , on july 12 , images showed a dramatic increase in melting with thawing across 97 percent of the ice sheet surface .
