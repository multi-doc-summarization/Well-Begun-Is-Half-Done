 investigate if ice inside high-latitude antarctic notothenioid fishes could melt seasonally , we measured its melting point and obtained a decadal temperature record from a shallow benthic fish habitat in mcmurdo sound , antarctica . newline_char antarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins ( afps ) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth . newline_char our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome afp-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice . newline_char superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified afps , and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 Â°c above their eqfmp for at least 24 h , and at a lower temperature for at least several days . newline_char abstract antifreeze proteins ( afps ) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that , by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of internalized environmental ice crystals , they prevent death by inoculative freezing . story_separator_special_tag they discovered the antifreeze proteins ' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens . newline_char that 's right , the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting . story_separator_special_tag the proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish , but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting . newline_char the notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the antarctic region . newline_char now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies .
