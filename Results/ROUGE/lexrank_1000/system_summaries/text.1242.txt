sults : total nut intake was related to lower overall and cause-specific mortality ( cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular , respiratory , neurodegenerative diseases , other causes ) in men and women . newline_char abstract background : nut intake has been associated with lower mortality , but few studies have investigated causes of death other than cardiovascular disease , and dose-response relationships remain unclear . newline_char peanuts and tree nuts were inversely related to mortality , whereas peanut butter was not . newline_char when comparing those consuming 0.1− < 5 , 5− < 10 and 10+ g nuts/day with non-consumers , multivariable hazard ratios for total mortality were 0.88 , 0.74 and 0.77 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 0.66–0.89 ] , respectively ( p trend = 0.003 ) . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag daily consumption of nuts and peanuts linked to lower mortality rates 11 june 2015 nuts and peanuts , but not peanut butter , may protect against death from cancer , heart disease , respiratory disease and other major causes , new study finds a paper published today in the international journal of epidemiology confirms a link between peanut and nut intake and lower mortality rates , but finds no protective effect for peanut butter . newline_char peanuts show at least as strong reductions in mortality as tree nuts , but peanut butter is not associated with mortality , researchers from maastricht university ( the netherlands ) found . newline_char however , in this new study , it was found that mortality due to cancer , diabetes , respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases was also lowered among users of peanuts and nuts . newline_char project leader and epidemiologist professor piet van den brandt commented : “ it was remarkable that substantially lower mortality was already observed at consumption levels of 15 grams of nuts or peanuts on average per day ( half a handful ) .
