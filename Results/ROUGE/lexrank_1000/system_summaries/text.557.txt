searchers say methane rising to the surface of the ocean could explain the sudden loss of ships in the western north atlantic . newline_char some say that the magnetic properties of the rocks might scramble compass readings , others that giant bubbles of methane might sink ships when they reach the surface . newline_char well , according to vincent gaddis , who first coined the phrase in a pulp magazine article in 1964 , the bermuda triangle is an area of the western north atlantic where ships and planes are strangely likely to vanish without trace . story_separator_special_tag methane bubbles from the sea floor could , in theory , sink ships and may explain the odd disappearances of some vessels , australian researchers reported tuesday . newline_char “ sonar surveys of the ocean floor in the north sea ( between britain and continental europe ) have revealed large quantities of methane hydrates and eruption sites , ” may and monaghan wrote in their report , published in the american journal of physics . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag however , other scientists not involved in the new report say the weird sinkhole mechanism likely does n't explain vanishings in the bermuda triangle — a place that has never been proven to exist . story_separator_special_tag sea bed gas blasts could explain bermuda triangle huge craters on the sea floor , found off norway , suggest giant blowouts of methane ( alamy ) scientists have found giant craters on the sea bed around the coast of norway , marking spots where huge bubbles of methane have apparently exploded . newline_char one idea is that they may explain the disappearance of ships in areas such as the bermuda triangle . story_separator_special_tag newly-found craters off the coast of norway suggest the sea ’ s potential for enormous blowouts of methane gas , the scientists said , adding some credence to an idea that has been floated before . newline_char the theory is that gas bubbles rising to the surface could sink an unfavorably-positioned ship , some scientists have
