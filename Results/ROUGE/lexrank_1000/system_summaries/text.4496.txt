tory_separator_special_tag " call it chick nonfiction , if you will ; this book is not about politics , it ’ s about marriage , or at least one marriage , and a notably successful one at that . newline_char " —douglas brinkley reviewing jodi kantor 's surprisingly controversial book the obamas . story_separator_special_tag in a largely positive review of jodi kantor ’ s book the obamas in the new york times book review , douglas brinkley—a historian who has published books about several presidents—wrote , “ call it chick nonfiction , if you will ; this book is not about politics , it ’ s about marriage , or at least one marriage. newline_char while the obamas ’ primary subject is the marriage itself , kantor is a white house reporter for the times , and the book broke several bits of news concerning michelle obama ’ s frustration with a perceived failure to enact her husband ’ s agenda—particularly with regard to health care and immigration reform—and her indirect conflict with chief of staff rahm emanuel and press secretary robert gibbs . newline_char kantor declined to comment for this story , and sam tanenhaus , the editor of the times book review , did not reply to a request for comment . newline_char here , that alleged lack of respect—and to call a book “ chick nonfiction ” is to call it unserious—extends not only to the woman who is the author but also to the woman who is the subject . newline_char the book documents the first marriage , with an emphasis on the first lady and how she was able to influence white house policy . newline_char it ’ s a little outside my ordinary purview—though kantor , a new york times reporter , is jewish—but the line struck me as newsworthy , particularly given recent discussion accusing the times book review of giving short shrift to woman authors .
