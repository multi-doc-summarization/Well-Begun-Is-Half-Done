e ventrolateral frontal cortex area of the brain is involved in many of the highest aspects of cognition and language , and is only present in humans and other primates . newline_char the researchers were then able to compare the 12 areas in the human brain region with the organization of the monkey prefrontal cortex . newline_char the psychologists behind a new mri study say it is key components in the ventrolateral frontal cortex area of the human brain , and how these components were connected up with other brain areas . newline_char we wanted to look at this very important region of the frontal part of the brain and see how many tiles there are and where they are placed . newline_char we 've identified an area of the brain that appears to be uniquely human and is likely to have something to do with these cognitive powers , " says senior researcher professor matthew rushworth of oxford university 's department of experimental psychology.the brain is a mosaic of interlinked areas . story_separator_special_tag the combination of scans allowed the scientists to work out in exquisite detail how each part of the ventrolateral frontal cortex ( vlfc ) , a region crucial for language and cognitive flexibility , was connected with any other part of the brain . newline_char ball of tissue named lateral frontal pole found to be crucial in analysing alternative decisions â€“ and may be unique to humans a new brain region that appears to help humans identify whether they have made bad decisions has been discovered by researchers . newline_char one scan , called diffusion-weighted mri , revealed the neural pathways that connect different parts of the brain . newline_char the other , called functional mri ( fmri ) , showed which areas of the brain were most active when the patients were resting .
