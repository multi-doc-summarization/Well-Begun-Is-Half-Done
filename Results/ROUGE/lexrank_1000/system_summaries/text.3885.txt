oser examination of the animals ' anatomy revealed that the sea slugs had a large part of their penis coiled up in a spiral inside their bodies , which they would then use to replenish their missing part . newline_char image caption all sea slugs have complicated mating behaviour , but chromodoris reticulata has surprised scientists with its ability to lose and then re-grow its penis a sea slug that is able to detach , re-grow and then re-use its penis has surprised scientists . newline_char it was not clear once the internal penis was used up after these attempts whether the animal 's sex life - at least the male part of it - was effectively over or - after a few weeks or months - the organ could regrow . story_separator_special_tag sea animal has grow-again penis paris â€” scientists reported wednesday on the bizarre sex life of a sea slug that discards its penis after copulation . newline_char " in another revelation about the sea slug 's sex life , the scientists found its penis was covered with spines -- and suggested these may be used to remove the sperm of previous partners being held in store by their mate . newline_char after each coupling , which lasted between dozens of seconds and a few minutes , every slug discarded its penis -- a thread-like organ that it projects from its side into a partner 's vagina . newline_char the team also examined the microscopic structure and function of the male organs -- observing an internal spiral structure they believe grows into a replacement penis . newline_char the spines are backward-pointing , making it difficult to withdraw the penis after copulation . newline_char " chromodoris reticulata may compensate for the short-term cost of decreased reproductive opportunities caused by the loss of a penis with the reproductive advantage gained by sperm displacement , " wrote the study authors .
