ey 'll have two days to make a decision before the 20th week of alisha 's pregnancy ends , and , with it , her last chance to get an abortion . newline_char pete told us over the phone that on that day he plans to check polldaddy 's records to make sure there has n't been any double-voting or other evidence of fraud and then he and alisha will use the results to decide whether to keep the baby . newline_char during the second pregnancy , the couple bought the birthornot.com domain , and were in the process of deciding whether to put the birth up to a vote when they lost the baby . newline_char " pete and alisha arnold , both 30 , both tech professionals , live in the minneapolis suburb of apple valley and have been married for 10 years . newline_char " " give birth " has 46 percent of the vote at the moment , with " have an abortion " at 54 percent . story_separator_special_tag abortion is a personal decision : just like i ca n't tell some woman she should have 10 children because she and her spouse are beautiful and intelligent ( and have phds from ivy league schools ) , i ca n't tell someone they should n't have children because they ca n't afford it . newline_char some facts the arnolds have probably missed : pro-choice does n't mean pro-abortion : one can support every woman 's right to make her own choice while also finding abortion to be an unfortunate and painful choice . newline_char abortion is n't easy : if they do support a woman 's right to choose , as they say they do , then they 're doing it a major disservice . newline_char just because i think abortion should be legal does n't mean i support it in general .
