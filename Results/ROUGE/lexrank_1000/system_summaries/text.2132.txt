e discovery raises the possibility that other tadpoles may produce sound . newline_char the researchers found that when horned frog tadpoles come into contact with , or are prodded by , an external object such as a metal spatula , they let out a brief , metallic sound consisting of a short series of higher frequency pulses . newline_char the tadpoles produce the sound by pushing air out of their lungs , which develop very early ; tadpoles that are just three days old are capable of emitting loud distress signals . newline_char horned frog tadpoles are naturally aggressive and carnivorous , often eating the tadpoles of other frogs , and it is possible that the scream is mainly emitted when another horned frog tadpole moves to attack it as a measure to avoid cannibalism . story_separator_special_tag the discovery that frog tadpoles can make sounds also raises the possibility that a host of aquatic larvae communicate in a similar way . newline_char frog facts watch an 'alien scene ' of feasting tadpoles the first truly monogamous amphibian was discovered this year toads , close relatives of frogs , may be able to predict when an impending earthquake will strike watch more videos of bizarre frog and toad behaviour here each " scream " lasts for just 0.05 seconds . newline_char advertisement tadpoles of one frog species let out an audible " scream " when they come under attack , scientists have discovered . newline_char they continue to emit distress calls underwater both as tadpoles and after they have begun metamorphosis ( when they become froglets ) . newline_char the distress calls are made by tadpoles of the horned frog ceratophrys ornata which lives in argentina , uruguay and brazil , researchers report in the journal acta zoologica . newline_char the lungs develop very early in this species ; tadpoles that are just three days old are capable of emitting loud distress signals .
