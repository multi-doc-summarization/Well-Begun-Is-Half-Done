tory_separator_special_tag , the mathematical basis of the spectral-temporal asymmetry ) to frame mustached bat literature , we show that recent findings in bat ac ( 1 ) support the notion that hemispheric specialization for speech and music is based on hemispheric differences in temporal and spectral resolution , ( 2 ) discredit closed-system , handedness , and brain-volume theories , ( 3 ) underscore the importance of sex differences , and ( 4 ) provide new avenues for phonological research . newline_char hemispheric lateralization for language : a multi-faceted controversy the finding that damage to the left cerebral hemisphere in humans impairs receptive language ( e.g. newline_char mustached bats have smaller brains , but greater ethological pressures to develop such a spectral-temporal asymmetry , than humans . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag washington -- researchers from georgetown university medical center and american university have shown that , like humans , mustached bats use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds . newline_char the scientists say their study , published in frontiers of neuroscience , opens a pathway to studying bat brains in order to understand certain human language disorders and potentially even improving computer speech recognition . newline_char washington says the findings of asymmetrical sound processing in both human and bat brains make evolutionary sense . newline_char " bats need to use the fast timing of the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds from each other , because their communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency . newline_char " it is therefore reasonable to understand why humans needed to evolve this asymmetry in their brains . newline_char aside from humans , no other animal that has been studied , not even monkeys or apes , has proved to use such hemispheric specialization for sound processing -- meaning that the left brain is better at processing fast sounds , and the right processing slow ones .
