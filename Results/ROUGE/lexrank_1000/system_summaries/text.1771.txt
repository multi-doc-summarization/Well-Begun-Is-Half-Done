e researchers estimate that at least several hundred thousand ants , possibly a million , call the bizarre barren mound home . newline_char but the researcher saw no ants on the ceiling , and no evidence that any of them had ever returned to the mother colony above . newline_char in the bunker , the ants find themselves in total darkness , with very little food to eat . newline_char in the summer , the ants climb the walls of the bunker , perhaps in an effort to touch the warmer air coming from above . newline_char and every year hundreds of thousands of ants soldier off and fall down a ventilation pipe into the weapons storage bunker below ground , never to see the light of day again . story_separator_special_tag like most ant species , wood ants are tidy animals who remove waste from their colony . newline_char eventually a massive colony of wood ants took up residence in the soil over the bunker . newline_char because conditions in the bunker are so harsh , constantly cold , and mostly barren , the ants seem to live in a state of near-starvation . newline_char what they found , over two seasons of observation , was a group of almost a million worker ants whose lives are so strange that they hesitate to call them a " colony " in the observations they just published in the journal of hymenoptera . newline_char there was just one problem : the ants built their nest directly over a vertical ventilation pipe . newline_char every year when the nest expands , thousands of worker ants fall down the pipe and can not climb back out . newline_char in the case of the bunker ants , most of this waste is composed of dead bodies . newline_char the massive group tending the nest is entirely composed of non-reproductive female workers , supplemented every year by a new rain of unfortunate ants falling down the ventilation shaft .
