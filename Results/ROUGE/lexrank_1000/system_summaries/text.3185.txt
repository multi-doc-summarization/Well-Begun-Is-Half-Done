evious research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would , dickinson said , but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would . newline_char in his lab , dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies , also known as drosophila hydei , are very similar to those of a fighter jet . newline_char “ these flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and , in almost a single wing beat , the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate , ” muijres said in the uw release . newline_char more like a plane than a boat “ one of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly , ” dickinson said . newline_char once they sense danger , fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight , rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat , new research shows . story_separator_special_tag ” the scientists watched the flies fly through two crossing laser beams , newline_char [ updated at 5:15 p.m. pdt april 10 : tracking how these insects fly in response to a threat should help researchers understand the fruit fly 's inner life , said cornell university physicist jane wang , who was not involved in the research . newline_char dickinson and his colleagues captured 3,566 wing beats involved in 92 separate fruit fly escapes , which was no easy task . newline_char " ] when trying to escape from a threat , the drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that ’ s five times faster than their normal turning speed , according to researchers from the university of washington .
