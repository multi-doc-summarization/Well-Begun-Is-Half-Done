tory_separator_special_tag the new study analyzed the food waste issue by focusing on the amount of seafood lost annually at each stage of the food supply chain and at the consumer level . newline_char " " it would generally be preferable for the fish that becomes bycatch to be left alive in the water rather than eaten , and due to seafood 's short shelf life , it may be particularly challenging compared to other food items to get the remaining seafood eaten or frozen before it decays , " she says . newline_char in the u.s. and around the world , people are being advised to eat more seafood , but overfishing , climate change , pollution , habitat destruction and the use of fish for other purposes besides human consumption threaten the global seafood supply . newline_char the researchers offer several approaches to reduce seafood waste along the food chain from catch to consumer . newline_char the findings , published in the november issue of global environmental change , come as food waste in general has been in the spotlight and concerns have been raised about the sustainability of the world 's seafood resources . newline_char the researchers found the greatest portion of seafood loss occurred at the level of consumers ( 51 to 63 percent of waste ) . newline_char to illustrate the magnitude of the loss , the authors estimate this lost seafood could contain enough protein to fulfill the annual requirements for as many as 10 million men or 12 million women ; and there is enough seafood lost to close 36 percent of the gap between current seafood consumption and the levels recommended by the 2010 u.s. dietary guidelines . newline_char waste reduction has the potential to support increased seafood consumption without further stressing aquatic resources , says roni neff , phd , director of the food system sustainability & public health program at clf and an assistant professor with the bloomberg school of public health .
