the lincoln researchers carefully adapted the ainsworth strange situation test ( sst ) , which has been widely used to demonstrate that the bond between young children or pet dogs with their primary carer can be categorised as a ‘ secure attachment ’ – where the carer is seen as a focus of safety and security in potentially threatening ( or unfamiliar ) environments.the study observed the relationships between a number of cats and their owners , placing the pets in an unfamiliar environment together with their owner , with a stranger and also on their own . newline_char “ although our cats were more vocal when the owner rather than the stranger left them with the other individual , we didn ’ t see any additional evidence to suggest that the bond between a cat and its owner is one of secure attachment . story_separator_special_tag a cross-over design experiment with 20 cat-owner pairs ( 10 each undertaking one of the two versions of the sst first ) and continuous focal sampling was used to record the duration of a range of behavioural states expressed by the cats that might be useful for assessing secure attachment . newline_char the ainsworth strange situation test ( sst ) has been widely used to demonstrate that the bond between both children and dogs to their primary carer typically meets the requirements of a secure attachment ( i.e . newline_char although cats vocalised more when the owner rather the stranger left the cat with the other individual , there was no other evidence consistent with the interpretation of the bond between a cat and its owner meeting the requirements of a secure attachment . newline_char given these findings and the tendency of owners to consider pet cats as part of the family [ 36 ] , it seems reasonable to examine whether the typical bond shown by pet cats towards their owners also involves a form of secure attachment that provides additional safety and security .
