r study certainly does not rule this out , but it suggests that there is likely to be an association in the other direction as well – that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use , " said robert power , who led the study at the institute of psychiatry at king 's college london . newline_char the results chime with previous studies linking schizophrenia and cannabis , but suggest the association may be due to common genes and might not be a causal relationship where cannabis use leads to increased schizophrenia risk . story_separator_special_tag today , these findings are more nuanced , but researchers still think that cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in people who are predisposed to the disease — meaning those with family histories of the disorder . newline_char " " there is a well-established link between people who use cannabis and schizophrenia , " says robert power , lead author of the study and a genetic psychiatrist at king 's college london . newline_char this , researchers say , demonstrates that the causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia might not be clear-cut , and that at least a small part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap , where the same genes that predispose certain people to enjoying weed might also predispose others to developing schizophrenia — or both . newline_char " these findings are very valuable , " says eden evins , a psychiatry professor at harvard university who was not involved in the study , " and suggest that increased genetic risk for schizophrenia increases the chance that someone will use cannabis , and use it heavily . newline_char moreover , the genetic variants associated with schizophrenia were predictive for cannabis use in healthy individuals , so there appears to be some genetic overlap between the two .
