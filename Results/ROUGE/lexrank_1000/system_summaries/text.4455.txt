ree years ago this week , an intoxicated christine o'donnell showed up at the apartment of a 25-year-old philadelphian and ended up spending the night in his bed . newline_char we 'd met for the first and only time three months earlier when my two roommates and i signed the lease on our apartment : christine 's aunt owned the place we were moving into , and she happened to be up from delaware visiting at the time . story_separator_special_tag he was one of several journalists and bloggers to criticize gawker for posting an anonymous account by a philadelphia man claiming to have gone home with delaware senate candidate on halloween night three years ago , following a night of drinking . newline_char but editor remy stern told the upshot that gawker ran the item because it 's " a great story " and pushed back against the misogyny charge , arguing that the alleged incident was worth noting because o'donnell 's private actions -- according to the anonymous writer -- run counter to her public persona as an advocate of christian conservative values . newline_char stern said gawker paid in the " low four figures " for the o'donnell story , but also did its due diligence in checking the accuracy of the man 's claims . story_separator_special_tag i am no fan of o'donnell but what gawker has done is disgusting and vile and once again not showcasing the real issues in this election . newline_char twitter is abuzz with reactions to a tell-all posted anonymously today by a man claiming to have had a one-night stand with christine o'donnell three years ago . newline_char over at the upshot , michael calderone spoke with gawker editor remy stern , who defended the piece as " a great story " that had " nothing to do with her being a woman .
