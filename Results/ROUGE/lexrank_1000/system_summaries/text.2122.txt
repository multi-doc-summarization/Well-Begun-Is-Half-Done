mpared to a more familiar flying shape , such as an airplane wing scaled down to snake size , " you 'd find the snake is actually comparable , " socha said . newline_char while birds , and even humans using glider wings , are much better at their airborne maneuvers , the snake 's performance compares favorably to that of other gliding animals , such as flying squirrels , lizards and even ants , socha said . newline_char it turned out that the flying saucer cross-section was a surprisingly good shape to take — much better than the cylindrical shape the snake would have if it did n't compress itself . newline_char now , the team has to solve another mystery : why the snake undulates once or twice every second while gliding , socha said . newline_char a flying snake flattens out into a weird flying-saucer shape in order to get some extra airtime , new research suggests . story_separator_special_tag the results , published january 29 in the journal of experimental biology , showed that at most angles , the snake model ’ s undulating shape generated enough lift to account for the animal ’ s gliding ability . newline_char now scientists have discovered the secret behind how these snakes stay airborne—they twist their bodies into an s shape that resembles an alien ’ s flying saucer from the side . newline_char ) the researchers added that real flying snakes appear to glide even better than their findings from the 3-d printed model would suggest . newline_char as frightening as the idea of a 4-foot ( 1.2-meter ) flying snake might be to some , these mildly venomous reptiles are harmful only to small prey . newline_char clues from 3-d printing to learn more about the aerodynamic forces the snakes generate , socha and his colleagues used a 3-d printer , which works by depositing layers on top of layers to create 3-d objects .
