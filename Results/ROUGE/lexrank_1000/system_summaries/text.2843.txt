in conjunction with the rewilding europe group , the tauros , bred from a number of current species with auroch ancestry , have been released into areas of spain , portugal , croatia , the czech republic and romania , where they have had to contend with wolves and other predators . newline_char now conservationists who believe the bovine ancestor was key to preserving the continent 's ecosystem have said they are 'rewilding ' the fourth generation of their experimental auroch replacement as part of the tauros project . newline_char the auroch roamed the grassy plains of europe for 250,000 years until it died out in poland in 1627 , and adolf hitler 's followers tried to breed a similar beast as part of their aryan mythology . story_separator_special_tag " you could see from the first generation that apart from the horn size , there was enough wild in the breed to produce animals far closer to the auroch than we would have expected , " says goderie . newline_char geneticists advised breeding certain species together to produce offspring closer to the qualities of an auroch , and then breed the offspring . newline_char the animals get closer with each generation , and the team have the advantage of being able to test the offspring 's dna against the complete genome of an auroch , which was successfully sequenced at university college dublin . newline_char " auroch genes remain present in various breeds of cattle around the continent , and the team identified descendants in spain , portugal , italy and the balkans . newline_char rewilding europe was able to provide protected land across the continent ; in croatia , spain , portugal , the czech republic , and romania , where goderie 's cross-breeds could test themselves in the wild . newline_char in the wild the tauros programme connected with rewilding europe early on , a group that supports the restoration of natural processes through projects that range from rebuilding rivers to introducing apex predators .
