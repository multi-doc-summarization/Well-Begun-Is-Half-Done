iting in a british scientific journal , michael dillon of the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california , has now come up with a mathematical model for the “ optimal shelter exit time ” to minimise radiation risk . newline_char “ these methods are intended to assist emergency planning officials in the development of an optimal low-yield nuclear detonation response strategy , ” wrote dillon . newline_char more than a fifth of american households lack basements or are considered too lightweight to offer shelter in the fallout phase of the emergency , the study said . newline_char based on his calculations , if adequate shelter is 15 minutes away , individuals should remain in their initial , poor-quality shelter no longer than 30 minutes after detonation . story_separator_special_tag underground concrete shelters are best , as they put the largest amount of mass between a person and fallout , but the core of large buildings — such as large offices or schools — can also provide adequate shelter , dillon said . newline_char through his analyses , dillon determined that people within poor-quality shelters can reduce radiation poisoning by staying within those shelters for only up to 30 minutes after the detonation before seeking out adequate shelter , as long as that shelter is reachable within 15 minutes . newline_char [ the top 10 largest explosions ever ] the best way to protect against the radioactive dust and ash of nuclear fallout is to seek shelter underground , but more than 20 percent of u.s. households do not have basements , according to a 2009 survey from the u.s. energy information administration . newline_char people living within about 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) of a small-scale nuclear attack have up to half an hour to seek out adequate shelter safely , as long as travel time to that shelter is no more than 15 minutes away , according to a recent report on the optimal escape strategies for small-scale nuclear explosions .
