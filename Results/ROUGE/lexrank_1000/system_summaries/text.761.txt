 conducted experiments to test whether chronic exposure to a maximally environmentally relevant concentration of fluoxetine ( 2.7 μg day−1 ) altered courtship behaviour and female reproductive physiology in wild-caught starlings ( sturnus vulgaris ) , a species commonly found foraging on invertebrates at wastewater treatment plants . newline_char like other human pharmaceuticals , the antidepressant fluoxetine ( prozac ) enters the environment via sewage and has been detected at wastewater treatment plants . story_separator_special_tag that ’ s significant , arnold said , because singing is an important part of birds ’ courtship rituals , and is used to judge potential mates . newline_char complicating the question is the fact that birds aren ’ t just being exposed to prozac — they ’ re also potentially ingesting a whole slew of other drugs that have ended up in the sewage system . newline_char to figure out the effect that these pharmaceuticals have on birds , the researchers first had to figure out how much fluoxetine is typically found in worms and bugs at sewage treatment plants . newline_char male starlings were also much more aggressive toward female starlings that had been exposed to low doses of prozac , the researchers found . newline_char they then replicated that , dosing worms with a low concentration of prozac — less than 10 percent of what a human would be given for therapeutic purposes , arnold said . newline_char when paired with female starlings that had been eating the prozac-laced worms , males only sang half as often and for half as long as they did when they were paired with a female that hadn ’ t been exposed to the drug . newline_char but the amount of these drugs that end up in sewage plants may also have an impact on the mating habits of wild birds , a new study from the university of york shows .
