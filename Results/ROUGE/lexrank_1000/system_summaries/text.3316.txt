edit : nasa " the sun 's polar magnetic fields weaken , go to zero , and then emerge again with the opposite polarity , " stanford solar physicist phil scherrer said in a statement . newline_char editor 's note : see our update on what the sun 's magnetic flip means for earth here : sun 's magnetic field flip wo n't doom earth , scientists say the sun is gearing up for a major solar flip , nasa says . newline_char the flipping of the sun 's magnetic field marks the peak of the star 's 11-year solar cycle and the halfway point in the sun 's " solar maximum " â€” the peak of its solar weather cycle . newline_char these dark regions on the sun 's surface can give birth to solar flares and ejections , but there have been fewer observed sunspots this year than in the maximums of previous cycles . newline_char " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , the director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement . story_separator_special_tag nearing the mid-point of the sun 's 24th observed solar cycle , the star 's south pole will soon follow the north 's lead and change its magnetic sign . newline_char clarification : the sun has gone through 24 solar cycles since scientists began recording solar activity . newline_char the 11-year cycle governs the level of solar activity on the sun . newline_char while the field reversal is a big event for the solar system , the change in polarity is rather routine . newline_char the magnetic flip takes place at the peak of each solar cycle every 11 years . newline_char " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , a solar physicist and director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement released by the agency .
