rlier this month , nasa published the below video introducing its concept submarine designed to explore kraken mare , one of the methane seas on titan , the remarkably strange moon circling saturn . newline_char in addition to floating or diving around checking out the chemistry of titan 's sea and sea floor composition , the sub could also study the moon 's tides , weather , shoreline , disappearing islands and keep an eye out for any evidence of really weird life forms that like to hang out in super chilly , gassy locales . newline_char the titan sub concept is very preliminary at this point , but there 's plenty of time to work on it . newline_char getting the sub to titan presents a bit of challenge since it wo n't fit into the sphere-cone shaped landers that have typically been used for planetary exploration in the past . story_separator_special_tag nasa engineers estimate the titan submarine would weigh in at about one ton and make use of electrically-powered turbines to get around the liquid methane lake . newline_char this is the target for nasa ’ s titan submarine as it would provide the most opportunities for exploration . newline_char data from the voyager , cassini , and huygens ( deployed by cassini ) probes have confirmed that there are three large polar seas on titan ’ s surface , and the largest of them is known as kraken mare . newline_char titan is about 80 light minutes away , so that means nasa would have to wait 160 minutes to get a response after each command was sent . newline_char the aptly ( though unimaginatively ) named titan submarine phase i conceptual design could some day go for a dip in the hydrocarbon lakes of saturn ’ s moon titan . newline_char there aren ’ t many details on exactly what sort of instruments the titan sub would carry , but the data obtained would be transmitted back to earth in an unusual way .
