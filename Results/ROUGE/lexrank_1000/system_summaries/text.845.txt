the mississippi river discharge levels and associated nutrient data , supplied in may by the usgs , pointed to an average size hypoxia area based on the inputs which fuel mid-summer 's dead zone algal growth , " rabalais said in a separate news release issued monday by noaa . newline_char based on the 2014 results , the five-year average size of the low-oxygen area is 5,543 square miles , which is almost three times larger than the target set by a federal/state mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force in 2001 as part of a national effort to reduce the size of the dead zone . newline_char this year 's low-oxygen " dead zone " along louisiana coast covers 5,052 square miles , an area the size of the state of connecticut but about 800 square miles less than the 2013 dead zone , according to a week-long survey released monday . story_separator_special_tag the elongated gulf zone typically hugs the louisiana coastline from the mississippi river delta to the state 's border with texas , and some years extending offshore of texas and mississippi , rabalais said . newline_char the gulf dead zone , which fluctuates in size but measured 5,052 square miles this summer , is exceeded only by a similar zone in the baltic sea around finland , turner said . newline_char turner said the zone has at least twice in recent years reached the size of massachusetts , about 8,200 square miles ( 21,000 sq km ) . story_separator_special_tag share this story the gulf dead zone is a huge swath of the gulf of mexico just west of the mississippi river delta that is nearly devoid of oxygen and proportionally saturated with nitrogen and phosphorus pollution . newline_char and while this growth falls into recent models based on current nitrogen measurements , it is still three times larger than the environmental target set by a federal task force in 2001 , dedicated to keeping the zone controlled .
