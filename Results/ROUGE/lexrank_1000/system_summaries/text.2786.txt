s model simulations showed that only the carb-restricted diet would lead to changes in the amount of fat burned by the body , whereas the reduced-fat diet would lead to greater overall body fat loss , but he needed the human data to back it up . newline_char in a paper published august 13 in cell metabolism , the researchers show how , contrary to popular claims , restricting dietary fat can lead to greater body fat loss than carb restriction , even though a low-carb diet reduces insulin and increases fat burning . newline_char to keep the variables simple , the two observation periods were like two sides of a balance scale : during the first period , 30 % of baseline calories were cut through carb restriction alone , while fat intake remained the same . story_separator_special_tag nih study finds cutting dietary fat reduces body fat more than cutting carbs in a recent study , restricting dietary fat led to body fat loss at a rate 68 percent higher than cutting the same number of carbohydrate calories when adults with obesity ate strictly controlled diets . newline_char those results suggest the body may eventually minimize differences in body fat loss when diets have the same number of calories . newline_char the researchers had previously simulated the study with a math model of human metabolism , whose body fat predictions matched the data later collected in the study . newline_char “ compared to the reduced-fat diet , the reduced-carb diet was particularly effective at lowering insulin secretion and increasing fat burning , resulting in significant body fat loss , ” said kevin hall , ph.d. newline_char then for six days , they were fed diets containing 30 percent fewer calories , achieved by cutting either only total carbs or total fat from the baseline diet , while eating the same amount of protein .
