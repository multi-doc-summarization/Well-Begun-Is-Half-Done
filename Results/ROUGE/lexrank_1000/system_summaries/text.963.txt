earlier studies in the 4,200 km2 chernobyl exclusion zone showed major radiation effects and pronounced reductions in wildlife populations . newline_char " it 's very likely that wildlife numbers at chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident , " says jim smith of the university of portsmouth in the uk . newline_char now , researchers reporting in the cell press journal current biology on october 5 have found that the chernobyl site looks less like a disaster zone and more like a nature preserve , teeming with elk , roe deer , red deer , wild boar , and wolves . story_separator_special_tag a new study shows that wildlife in the chernobyl disaster zone is thriving , indicating that the presence of humans is more damaging to wildlife than is radiation poisoning after a fire and explosion destroyed the chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 , more than 100,000 people were permanently evacuated from the area to avoid radiation levels that were twenty times greater than the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings . newline_char according to a letter published today in the journal , current biology , scientists report that the chernobyl disaster area is home to a rich and varied wildlife community , indicating that the mere presence of people is more damaging to wildlife than is radiation poisoning . newline_char people were evacuated after the chernobyl accident , but what happened to the local wildlife ? story_separator_special_tag image copyright v yurko image caption the team carried out a long-term survey of mammals including wild boar removing humans from what is now the exclusion zone around the damaged chernobyl nuclear reactor has allowed wildlife to return , researchers say . newline_char " the numbers of animals we see in chernobyl is similar to the populations in uncontaminated nature reserves , " prof smith said .
