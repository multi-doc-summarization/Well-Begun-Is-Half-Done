e extreme depth of the wind river earthquake poses some interesting questions now scientists have evidence that the wind river earthquake actually occurred deeper within the earth , in its mantle , rather than within the earth ’ s crust . newline_char earthquakes usually occur as tectonic plates in the earth ’ s crust grind into each other along fault lines , releasing pent up energy , or as slabs of crust descend deeper into the earth ’ s hotter and more viscous mantle . newline_char “ this earthquake occurred well within the mantle , and likely over 20 km deeper than the base of the crust , ” report the researchers in the journal . newline_char that would make it among the three deepest earthquakes yet identified to have occurred in a region covered by a stable continental crust . newline_char a mysterious earthquake that struck the centre of the us was one of the deepest earthquakes of its type ever recorded , say scientists . newline_char in the local area , known as the wyoming craton , the earth ’ s crust is no deeper than 40-50 km , forming part of the cold , stable lithosphere that underlies much of north america . newline_char earthquakes that occur near the surface produce more shaking , and those occurring at a depth of less than 70 km ( 43 mi ) are classified as shallow-focus earthquakes . story_separator_special_tag if you want to learn a bit of the science behind earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruptions , tsunamis , rogue waves , cyclones and hurricanes , and tornadoes , this is an introduction that weaves together stories of various disasters -- some barely known to much of the world -- their causes and dynamics , and some suggested actions we can take to protect ourselves . newline_char " review in science by donald turcotte " photos enhance the drama of this highly accessible look at disasters .
