w , researchers have made a significant advance toward replacing large pieces of bone in humans by growing a pig ’ s own cells into bone in the lab and then using it to restore a piece of missing jaw . newline_char growing new bone in the scaffold for weeks before implanting it could have advantages , says gordana vunjak-novakovic , a biomedical engineer at columbia university and senior author on the new paper . newline_char next , the researchers sucked some fat from the pigs ’ backs and isolated precursor cells that can become bone , known as mesenchymal stem cells . newline_char by simply soaking the scaffold in the medium , “ you ’ d get something that looks like m & m candy , ” vunjak-novakovic says : healthy bone cells might coat the outside , but they would n't penetrate to the center . newline_char in the new study , vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues tested that idea in 14 pigs with facial bone damage . newline_char but these approaches have involved adding precursor cells or growth factors to the scaffold right before it ’ s implanted and allowing the bone to develop inside the body . newline_char it would give growth in the scaffold a kind of head start , so that the synthesis of bone matrix is more likely to keep up with the body ’ s natural process of degrading bone . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag from cow bone , they sculpted a “ scaffold ” — a three-dimensional copy of the pig bone . newline_char vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues have managed to create living bone from stem cells . newline_char there was no problem with rejection , and the new bone integrated with the pig ’ s own tissue . newline_char the cells attached to the scaffold , forming a new bone identical to the original .
