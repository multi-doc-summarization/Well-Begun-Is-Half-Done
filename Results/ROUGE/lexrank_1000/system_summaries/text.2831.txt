cording to a fascinating new study led by columbia ’ s earth institute and published today the journal the cryosphere , which finds that greenland ’ s “ albedo , ” or reflectivity , has been decreasing since the mid 90s . story_separator_special_tag the surface energy balance and meltwater production of the greenland ice sheet ( gris ) are modulated by snow and ice albedo through the amount of absorbed solar radiation . newline_char analysis of mar outputs indicates that the observed albedo decrease is attributable to the combined effects of increased near-surface air temperatures , which enhanced melt and promoted growth in snow grain size and the expansion of bare ice areas , and to trends in light-absorbing impurities ( lai ) on the snow and ice surfaces . story_separator_special_tag greenland 's ice is getting darker , increasing risk of melting feedback loops from melting itself are driving changes in reflectivity greenland 's snowy surface has been getting darker over the past two decades , absorbing more heat from the sun and increasing snow melt , a new study of satellite data shows . story_separator_special_tag greenland ’ s ice sheet has been darkening for the past two decades , and new research delves into the processes behind this phenomenon . newline_char in a study that used satellite images stretching back decades , scientists have delved into the processes causing 'darkening ' of the greenland ice sheet – its diminishing ability to reflect the sun 's radiation . newline_char the study , published thursday in the cryosphere , a journal of the european geosciences union , considers the processes by which an ice sheet loses its ability to reflect sunlight – its albedo – terming this diminishing capability as “ darkening. newline_char greenland 's surface is absorbing more solar radiation as melting increases grain size and brings old impurities to the surface .
