new genomic study , published today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , offers up strong evidence that domesticated dogs originated in central asia , around modern day nepal and mongolia . newline_char all of this contrasting evidence has understandably created not a small amount of debate , but one thing that can be agreed upon is that all dogs came from eurasian gray wolves at least 15,000 years ago . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag ” village dogs therefore carry a more authentic genetic signature of original dog populations than the modern-day breeds created in the past 200 years , mainly in europe . newline_char the work looked at dna from thousands of living dogs to piece together their ancestry and geographical origins . newline_char ” that departs from earlier studies that pinpointed europe as where dogs were domesticated , although more recent work puts the location in southern china , just 1000 kilometres from the area boyko ’ s team proposes . newline_char boyko ’ s team took dna samples from 549 village dogs in 38 countries all over the globe . newline_char advertisement the team broke new ground by analysing dna samples from so-called “ village dogs ” , which have lived alongside humans throughout the world since dogs first evolved from wolves and were domesticated around 15,000 years ago . newline_char “ we find a clear pattern of genetic diversity focused on central asia , suggesting the first domesticated dogs came from this region. story_separator_special_tag dogs are the most diverse animal on the planet - a legacy of thousands of years of selective breeding by humans . newline_char " the fact that we looked at so many village dogs from so many different regions , we were able to narrow in on the patterns of diversity in these indigenous dogs , " dr boyko told bbc news .
