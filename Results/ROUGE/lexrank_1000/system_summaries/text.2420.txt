 2012 mochizuki posted a 500-page paper online that claimed to solve the puzzle , but it required a dense framework of new maths dubbed " inter-universal teichmüller theory " that even experienced mathematicians found difficult to follow . newline_char mochizuki is a highly-respected mathematician and his work is taken seriously , says minhyong kim of the university of oxford , but in the years since he posted the proof no one has been able to give a definitive answer on whether it is correct . newline_char now mochizuki has posted a new report describing his efforts to explain his theory to others . newline_char shinichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan , has tried to prove the abc conjecture , a long-standing pure maths problem , but now says fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work . newline_char it is n't really sustainable for mochizuki to teach people one-on-one , he adds , and any journal would probably require independent reviewers who have not studied under mochizuki to verify the proof . newline_char he has also criticised the rest of the community for not studying his work in detail , and says most other mathematicians are " simply not qualified " to issue a definitive statement on the proof unless they start from the very basics of his theory . story_separator_special_tag now , he has released a report in which he says that mathematicians working with him studying his theory have yet to find a flaw , but he criticized the community , saying that most researchers are “ simply not qualified ” to issue a definitive statement on the proof because they don ’ t truly understand his theory – and haven ’ t tried hard enough . newline_char shinichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan claims he has proven the abc conjecture , one of the longest standing mysteries of mathematics .
