ppose you dug a tunnel through the center of earth , jumped in , and let gravity pull you through . newline_char for decades , physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes . newline_char students assume that , like a billiard ball , earth has the same density throughout : roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter . newline_char the gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of isaac newton 's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion . story_separator_special_tag abstract this paper examines the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of earth as ascertained from seismic data . story_separator_special_tag the accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into account the constantly changing impact that gravity will have ( and ignoring drag due to the presence of air ) on the person falling , becoming less and less of a factor as the center of the earth is approached then growing stronger and stronger as the person heads " up " against gravity on the other side . newline_char credit : nasa ( phys.org ) —alexander klotz a student at mcgill university in canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question , how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the earth ? newline_char but klotz argues that it is time to start taking the different densities of the earth 's layers into consideration—after all , a lot of research has shown that our planet is a lot denser at the center than at the crust for example—and that of course would have an impact on the person falling through . newline_char that is a physics question put to students every year , and those who give it expect the answer to be 42 minutes .
