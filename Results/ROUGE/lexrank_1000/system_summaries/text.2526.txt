amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton of nasa 's goddard space flight center and the study 's lead author said in a press release . newline_char despite this seemingly low-key presence , however , understory fires can damage large areas because amazon trees are not adapted to fire and the long , slow burn can claim anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of the burn area 's trees . newline_char in all , the study shows that between 1999 and 2010 , understory forest fires burned more than 33,000 square miles ( 85,500 square kilometers ) , or 2.8 percent of the entire forest . newline_char called “ understory fires , ” they have long remained hidden because of their location far below the forest treetops ; however , using a new method , researchers have developed the first regional estimate of understory fire damage across the southern amazon . story_separator_special_tag " amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton , a researcher at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , md. newline_char these fires destroy several times more forest than is taken out by deforestation each year , according to a new study , published recently in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b . newline_char signs of damage appear in the year after the fires occur , and then gradually disappear as the rain forest recovers , the nasa statement said . newline_char but between 1999 and 2010 , these forest fires burned more than 33,000 square miles ( 85,500 square kilometers ) , an area larger than the state of south carolina , according to a nasa release .
