tory_separator_special_tag the new study suggests that pyroclastic flows from the ancient eruption took the form of slow , dense currents -- and not fast-moving jets as some experts previously thought . newline_char the research combines recent laboratory experiments with field data from the 1980s -- some of it captured in colorful kodachrome slides -- to show that the rivers of ash and gas emanating from the silver creek caldera likely traveled at modest speeds of about 10 to 45 miles per hour . newline_char when this supervolcano erupted 18.8 million years ago , it flooded parts of all three states with river-like currents of hot ash and gas called pyroclastic flows . story_separator_special_tag " it 's really interesting how you can have such a violent eruption producing such slow-moving flows , " said valentine , co-author of the new study . newline_char by analyzing rocks trapped in volcanic ash , valentine and his colleagues discovered the lethal ash flow spread at street speeds — about 10 to 45 mph ( 16 to 72 km/h ) . newline_char new evidence from an ancient eruption suggests the answer is a surprising yes . story_separator_special_tag the common response is that everyone within hundreds of kilometers of the volcano would be killed almost instantly thanks to the fast moving pyroclastic flows that can rush outward from the caldera volcano for more than 150 kilometers ( ~100 miles ) . newline_char pierre were wiped out mere moments after an eruption thanks to these avalanches of hot volcanic debris and ash . newline_char imagine being near a volcano when it unleashes a gigantic eruption . newline_char that idea is based on what we can see from these flows at smaller eruptions , where they race down the sides of the volcano at speeds over 500 kilometers per hour ( 300 mph ) . newline_char i ’ m not talking something fairly piddling like the 1980 eruption of mount st.
