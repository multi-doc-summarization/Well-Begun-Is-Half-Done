wever , substantial differences emerged at the relearning session : participants in the sleep group recalled an average of 10 word pairs on their first attempt , whereas those in the wake group could only muster up about 7 ; in addition , those that had slept took only about three cycles through the list to finish relearning , whereas those that had not slept needed twice that amount . newline_char in the wake group , the initial learning session occurred at 9 am and the relearning session occurred at 9 pm on the same day ; in the sleep group , the initial learning session occurred at 9 pm and the relearning session occurred at 9 am on the next day , after a night of sleep . newline_char in the study , 40 french-speaking adult participants learned a list of 16 swahili-french word pairs ( for example , nyanya-tomate ) , relearned those word pairs after a period of 12 hours that did or did not include sleep , and were tested on their memory for the word pairs after one week and after six months . newline_char however , new research by st√©phanie mazza and colleagues at the university of lyon , recently published in the journal psychological science , suggests another potential benefit of sleep : improved relearning . newline_char during the initial learning session there were no observed performance differences between the sleep and wake groups , which suggests that a similar degree of learning occurred in both groups . newline_char to date , most sleep and learning research has focused on recall , which is the capacity to remember information . newline_char sleep appears to be important for long-term potentiation , a strengthening of signals between neurons that is widely regarded as a mechanism of learning and memory . story_separator_special_tag we found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention .
