ught in the grip of their titanic forces , the artificial earthbound sun will be suspended , under tremendous pressure , in the pristine nothingness of iter ’ s vacuum interior . newline_char the machine , called the international thermonuclear experimental reactor , or iter , will stand a hundred feet tall , and it will weigh twenty-three thousand tons—more than twice the weight of the eiffel tower . newline_char iter is being built a mile or  newline_char even the iter organization , a makeshift scientific united nations , assembled eight years ago to construct the machine , is unprecedented . newline_char thirty-five countries , representing more than half the world ’ s population , are invested in the project , which is so complex to finance that it requires its own currency : the iter unit of account . newline_char no one knows iter ’ s true cost , which may be incalculable , but estimates have been rising steadily , and a conservative figure rests at twenty billion dollars—a sum that makes iter the most expensive scientific instrument on earth . newline_char eventually , physicists hope , commercial reactors modelled on iter will be built , too—generating terawatts of power with no carbon , virtually no pollution , and scant radioactive waste . story_separator_special_tag iter , the international fusion reactor project in france , is reeling from an assessment that found serious problems with the project 's leadership , management , and governance . newline_char : the executive summary of the report on management of the international iter fusion reactor project was published today by the new yorker . newline_char the report is so damning , science has learned , that after a 13 february special session that reviewed and accepted the report 's conclusions and recommendations , the iter council—the project 's governing body—restricted its readership to a small number of senior managers and council members .
