 all goes well , the curiosity rover will be on the mars surface at about 1:17 a.m. eastern time , and 13 minutes , 48 seconds later ( the time it takes for a radio signal to travel 154 million miles to earth from mars ) , there will be confirmation and cheering in the control room at 1:31 a.m. newline_char that is not powerful enough to be picked up by antenna on earth , but a nasa orbiter , mars odyssey , will act as a relay , re-transmitting the data to earth in real-time . newline_char if odyssey misses curiosity ’ s messages , a second orbiter , the mars reconnaissance orbiter , will also be listening . newline_char nasa engineers said it is quite possible for curiosity to land successfully and that they would not find out for hours . newline_char but , a couple of minutes before landing , the landing site at gale crater will rotate out of view from earth – that means the direct communications path will be blocked , too . story_separator_special_tag nasa ’ s chief scientist john grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty , in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board , curiosity is “ the most important nasa mission of the decade. newline_char ” worldwide spectacle the curiosity landing is shaping up to be an international spectacle . newline_char if no signal arrives from curiosity via three mars orbiters and the deep space network after 18 hours , nasa officials said , then they would start to worry about its safety . newline_char reaching , orbiting and landing on mars is notoriously hard . newline_char the landing , which could never be tested in full on earth , includes a hovering rocket stage , a kind of sky crane , to lower it to the ground .
