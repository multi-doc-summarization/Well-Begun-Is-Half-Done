tory_separator_special_tag the study found that , in the presence of vitamin b12 , the skin bacteria that are commonly linked to acne start pumping out inflammatory molecules known to promote pimples . newline_char looking for a mechanism by looking at the gene expression patterns , li 's team first found that the pathway that produces vitamin b12 was significantly altered in the skin bacteria of people with acne , compared with the skin bacteria of people without  newline_char in the study , scientists investigated the differences between skin bacteria from people prone to acne and bacteria from people with clear-skinned faces . story_separator_special_tag " so it ’ s exciting that we found that the potential link between b12 and acne is through the skin bacteria . newline_char a vitamin found in meats and dairy products may be linked to acne , a study published today in science translational medicine suggests . newline_char scientists have shown that the production of sebum — the oily , waxy stuff your skin makes — and a disorder of the cells that line the inside of hair follicles are both involved in acne development , but the role of bacteria in those pimples we all dread still holds some mysteries . story_separator_special_tag but it turns out that vitamin b12 could be causing acne , the skin disorder that results in spots , pimples and blackheads , scientists have found . newline_char researchers led by dr huiyang li , from the university of california , los angeles , write in the journal science translational medicine : " our findings suggest a new bacterial pathogenesis pathway in acne and provide one molecular explanation for the long-standing clinical observation that vitamin b12 supplementation leads to acne development in a subset of individuals . newline_char the new study solved the mystery by showing that the vitamin alters the metabolic activity of the skin bug responsible for acne , propionibacterium acnes .
