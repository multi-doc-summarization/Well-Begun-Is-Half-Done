tory_separator_special_tag pig remains in particular have often been used in past decomposition studies because of their similarities to human bodies ( which are often hard to come by ) : they have the same microbes in their  newline_char she set up other jars with pig , mouce , mole , rabbit , turtle , frog , sturgeon , or bird remains . newline_char the jars ’ screw caps , which let in some air , had stoppered holes that allowed her to periodically take samples of the gases building up inside . newline_char cuypers ’ s graduate student elien rosier started by putting tissue samples and organs from six autopsied corpses in jars in a lab closet . newline_char a new study reveals how they might have done it : decomposing humans seem to release a singular chemical cocktail , one that scientists might be able to use to better train cadaver dogs and even develop machines that could do the same job . story_separator_special_tag in this study , a validated method using a thermal desorber combined with a gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment during a period of 6 months . newline_char we found a combination of 8 compounds ( ethyl propionate , propyl propionate , propyl butyrate , ethyl pentanoate , pyridine , diethyl disulfide , methyl ( methylthio ) ethyl disulfide and 3-methylthio-1-propanol ) that led to the distinction of human and pig remains from other animal remains . newline_char in this study , we sampled the headspace of 6 human and 26 animal remains that decomposed for 6 months . newline_char therefore , it is difficult to compare results of research groups that study the decomposing remains outdoors . newline_char furthermore , it was possible to separate the pig remains from human remains based on 5 esters ( 3-methylbutyl pentanoate , 3-methylbutyl 3-methylbutyrate , 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate , butyl pentanoate and propyl hexanoate ) .
