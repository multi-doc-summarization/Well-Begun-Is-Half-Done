ven a radius of 1.20 ± 0.09 and a mass of 1.69 ± 0.41 , the planet ’ s mean density of 5.3 ± 1.8 g cm−3 is similar to earth ’ s , suggesting a composition of rock and iron . newline_char most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique , by which the planet ’ s size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star . newline_char here we report doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the earth-sized planet kepler-78b , which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours ( ref . newline_char planets of size 2–4 have proved to have a wide range of densities , implying a diversity of compositions4,5 , but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as earth . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag " this is the planet that , in many respects , is the most like earth that 's been discovered outside our solar system , " said andrew howard , of the university of hawaii at manoa 's institute for astronomy and lead author of one of the studies . newline_char aguilar ( cfa ) view full size image a puzzling alien planet is the closest thing to an earth twin in size and composition known beyond our solar system , though it 's far too hot to support life , scientists say . newline_char an artist 's illustration of the strange earth-like rocky planet kepler-78b , which orbits a sun-like star 400 light-years from earth . newline_char the planet is 20 percent wider and 80 percent more massive than earth . newline_char the planet was found by nasa 's prolific kepler space telescope , which has spotted nearly 3,600 potential exoplanets since its march 2009 launch . newline_char the exoplanet kepler-78b , whose supertight orbit baffles astronomers , is just 20 percent wider and about 80 percent more massive than earth , with a density nearly identical to that of our planet , two research teams report in separate papers published online today ( oct.
