sa announced monday that after 35 years of exploration , its voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new , unanticipated region of space near the edge of the solar system -- a " magnetic highway " where charged particles take the " exit ramp " to interstellar space . newline_char the region connects the sun 's magnetic field lines to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing " lower-energy charged particles that originate from inside our heliosphere ... newline_char the heliosphere is the " immense magnetic bubble containing our solar system , solar wind , and the entire solar magnetic field , " according to nasa . story_separator_special_tag the voyager team infers this region is still inside our solar bubble because the direction of the magnetic field lines has not changed . newline_char " although voyager 1 still is inside the sun 's environment , we now can taste what it 's like on the outside because the particles are zipping in and out on this magnetic highway , " said edward stone , voyager project scientist based at the california institute of technology , pasadena . newline_char -- nasa 's voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new region at the far reaches of our solar system that scientists feel is the final area the spacecraft has to cross before reaching interstellar space . newline_char " since december 2004 , when voyager 1 crossed a point in space called the termination shock , the spacecraft has been exploring the heliosphere 's outer layer , called the heliosheath . story_separator_special_tag they hope this road will lead voyager out of the heliosphere , away from the influence of the sun ’ s magnetic field… eventually . newline_char ed stone , voyager project scientist , based at caltech , explained that this highway is connected to interstellar space , but is still inside the magnetic field of the sun .
