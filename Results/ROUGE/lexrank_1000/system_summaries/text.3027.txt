 martin and his colleagues report in today ’ s issue of nature microbiology , these genes aren ’ t randomly scattered throughout modern organisms , but fall into distinct groups that reflect luca ’ s likely metabolism . newline_char the results suggest that luca was a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen , bolstering strong suspicions that life on earth formed in and around hydrothermal vents such as those found near undersea volcanoes . newline_char most evidence suggests that , like modern cells , luca stored genetic information using dna . newline_char genetic studies to date have revealed some tantalizing clues about luca . newline_char that made the 355 gene families likely luca candidates . newline_char now , researchers report that they ’ ve used this sort of genome mining to reveal new insights about the daily life of our last universal common ancestor , or luca . newline_char most notably , they reveal that luca was an anaerobe that grew in an environment devoid of the oxygen that most cells today require . story_separator_special_tag the concept of a last universal common ancestor of all cells ( luca , or the progenote ) is central to the study of early evolution and life 's origin , yet information about how and where luca lived is lacking . newline_char we investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of luca . newline_char the 355 phylogenies identify clostridia and methanogens , whose modern lifestyles resemble that of luca , as basal among their respective domains . story_separator_special_tag it is known as luca , the last universal common ancestor , and is estimated to have lived some four billion years ago , when earth was a mere 560 million years old .
