sn estimates that the quantity of ruthenium 106 released was major , between 100 and 300 terabecquerels , and that if an accident of this magnitude had happened in france it would have required the evacuation or sheltering of people in a radius of a few kilometers around the accident site . newline_char paris ( reuters ) - a cloud of radioactive pollution over europe in recent weeks indicates that an accident has happened in a nuclear facility in russia or kazakhstan in the last week of september , french nuclear safety institute irsn said on thursday . newline_char peres said that in recent weeks irsn and several other nuclear safety institutes in europe had measured high levels of levels of ruthenium 106 , a radioactive nuclide that is the product of splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor and which does not occur naturally . newline_char the irsn said that the concentrations of ruthenium 106 in the air  newline_char the ruthenium 106 was probably released in a nuclear fuel treatment site or center for radioactive medicine , peres said . story_separator_special_tag map showing the plausibility of the origin of the release : for the most plausible zone of release , the quantity of ruthenium 106 released estimated by irsn simulations is very important , between 100 and 300 terabecquerels . newline_char based on the meteorological conditions provided by météo france and the measurement results available in european countries , irsn carried out simulations to locate the release zone , to assess the quantity of ruthenium released , as well as the period and the duration of the release . newline_char as soon as it became aware of the first detections of ruthenium 106 in the atmosphere in europe , irsn mobilized all its means of radiological monitoring of the atmosphere and conducted regular analysis of the filters from its monitoring stations .
