stract to discover interordinal relationships of living and fossil placental mammals and the time of origin of placentals relative to the cretaceous-paleogene ( k-pg ) boundary , we scored 4541 phenomic characters de novo for 86 fossil and living species . story_separator_special_tag humankind ’ s common ancestor with other mammals may have been a roughly rat-size animal that weighed no more than a half a pound , had a long furry tail and lived on insects . newline_char but as researchers reported thursday in the journal science , the animal had several anatomical characteristics for live births that anticipated all placental mammals and led to some 5,400 living species , from shrews to elephants , bats to whales , cats to dogs and , not least , humans . story_separator_special_tag estimates based on dna , or so-called molecular evidence , suggest that placental mammals appeared in the mid-cretaceous period when dinosaurs like tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops still trod the earth . newline_char in a paper published this week in the journal science , an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data , as well as dna evidence , to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals . newline_char the scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago — a concept at odds with some current thinking . newline_char " placental mammals , including humans , make up the largest branch of the mammalian family tree . newline_char a tiny theoretical creature dubbed the " hypothetical placental mammal ancestor " is stealing the hearts of some evolutionary biologists — and annoying others — as it raises new debate over just when our early mammal ancestors began diversifying across the globe .
