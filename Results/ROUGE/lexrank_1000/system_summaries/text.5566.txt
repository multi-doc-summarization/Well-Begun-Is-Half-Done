alysis : hubble ’ s bizarre x-shaped slow-motion asteroid collision apart from the fact that p5 appears to have jets of gas and dust projecting in all directions — like spokes on a bicycle wheel — between the sept. newline_char ” in a nutshell , the yorp effect heats up the sun-facing side of an asteroid , but as the asteroid rotates , it radiates heat into space from the dark side . newline_char news : dying space rock : asteroid-comet hybrid discovered the asteroid belt , that is located between the orbits of mars and jupiter , is home to a huge population of asteroids . newline_char this heat radiation is carried away by infrared photons that themselves exert a tiny amount of momentum , or recoil , as they depart the asteroid . story_separator_special_tag 7 , 2013 : astronomers viewing our solar system 's asteroid belt with nasa 's hubble space telescope have seen for the first time an asteroid with six comet-like tails of dust . newline_char they do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once . newline_char if that happened , dust could slide toward the asteroid 's equator , shatter and fall off , and drift into space to make a tail . newline_char when hubble looked at the asteroid again sept. newline_char " this nasa hubble space telescope set of images reveals a never-before-seen set of six comet-like tails radiating from a body in the asteroid belt , designated p/2013 p5 . newline_char scientists using the pan-starrs survey telescope in hawaii announced their discovery of the asteroid aug. newline_char the asteroid 's nucleus , which measures 1,400 feet wide , is thousands of times more massive than the observed amount of ejected dust . newline_char jewitt said the spin rate could have increased enough that the asteroid 's weak gravity no longer could hold it together .
