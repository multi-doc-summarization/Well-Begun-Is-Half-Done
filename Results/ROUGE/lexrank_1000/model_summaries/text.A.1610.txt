some big news in america 's public health arena : the number of new cases of diabetes is clearly falling for the first time in 25 years , reports the new york times . stats released tuesday by the cdc show a nearly 20 % drop from 2008 to 2014 in what the newspaper calls " the first sustained decline " since diabetes began booming in the 1990s . specifically , the us saw 1.4 million new cases in 2014 , down from 1.7 million in 2008 . there 's still plenty of major trouble spots : the decline is pronounced among white people and less so for africanamericans and hispanics , and a notable gap remains in regard to education levels . " it 's not yet time for a parade , " says the head of the diabetes program at massachusetts general hospital . but , he adds , " it has finally entered into the consciousness of our population that the sedentary lifestyle is a real problem , that increased body weight is a real problem . " cbs notes that 10 % of adults in the us are believed to have type 2 diabetes and that more than a third have prediabetes—a condition that can lead to the full disease—which makes any sign that the numbers have peaked welcome . a cdc researcher calls the results " a little surprising " given the decades-long increases . but " it seems pretty clear now that incidence rates have actually started to drop . " ( meanwhile , a novel new treatment could one day make daily insulin injections a thing of the past . )
