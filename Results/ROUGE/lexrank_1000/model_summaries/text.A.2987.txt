" at no point did i mean that in an offensive way , " he said through an interpreter afterward . “ yesterday i was commenting that i ’ d never had any success against darvish , and the gesture was saying that i wish he would look at me like one of them and maybe he ’ d throw me an easy pitch so i can do something . " darvish , for his part , called the gesture " disrespectful , " but was n't making a big deal about it . " i have a lot of respect for him , " he said of gurriel , who played for a while in japan , " so i try not to think about it too much against him . " later , the pitcher tweeted : " since we are living in such a wonderful world , let 's stay positive and move forward instead of focusing on anger . i 'm counting on everyone 's big love . " gurriel could face league discipline , though it was unclear whether that might mean missing a world series game .
