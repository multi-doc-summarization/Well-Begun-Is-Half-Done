the soil under the highest point of the greenland ice sheet , scientists have learned , is 2.7 million years old , livescience reports . in other words , the silt buried under thousands of feet of ice " has been preserved from beyond the dawn of humankind , " says paul bierman , who determined the soil 's age through a geochemical dating process . the findings also suggest greenland was n't always as frosty as it is today : instead , it was a tundra for between 200,000 and one million years before it was encased in ice . it was once home to bits of forest , the scientists found using offshore plant dna . in other words , as the international business times has it , " greenland really was green . " the greenland ice sheet that 's there now , however , has been remarkably durable : the findings imply that it made it through a strong period of warming some 130,000 years ago . " it 's unlikely the ice sheet has disappeared for significant periods of time in the last three million years , at least at this one pinprick on this big island , " bierman says . " now human activity may spell the end of it . " ( what else lies under greenland 's ice ? a canyon that dwarfs the grand canyon , an aquifer holding 100 billion tons of water , and two huge lakes . )
