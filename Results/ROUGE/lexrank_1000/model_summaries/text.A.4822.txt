eight years ago , a much-discussed study estimated that there were 304 million lakes on earthâ€”but a careful count reveals that the number is closer to a third of that . the planet holds 117 million lakes , researchers find in what livescience calls the " best count yet . " and while they may be fewer in number , they take up more of the earth 's surface than scientists had thought : some 3.7 % of it , it turns out . experts used computers to count the bodies of water using high-resolution satellite images . " this is something one would have assumed had been done long ago , and was in a textbook somewhere , " says a researcher . one reason it was n't : most lakes are far from human residences , and millions are so small they have n't appeared on maps , livescience reports . indeed , 90 million of the lakes counted were between 0.5 to 2.5 acres , or less than two football fields . the new figure measures the lakes around today , a number that can easily change ; indeed , the aral sea , once the fourth-biggest lake on earth , is now almost dry , the independent reports . so what 's the point of all this counting ? " if we are to be able to make realistic estimates of the collected effects of the different processes in lakes , for example their contribution to global warming , we first need a good map , " a researcher says in a press release . ( of course , we 're not the only planet with lakes . )
