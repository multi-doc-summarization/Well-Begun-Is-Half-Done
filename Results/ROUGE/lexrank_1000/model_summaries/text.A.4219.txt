the butter was the surprise , not the simulated rape . that 's what director bernardo bertolucci is adding to the conversation on the recent dustup about one of his most famous movie scenes . outrage ensued after an interview with him from 2013 emerged in which he said he and marlon brando decided the morning of shooting to use a stick of butter ( as lubricant ) on actress maria schneider during the rape scene in last tango in paris , but bertolucci says the scene itself was n't a shock to schneider , the ap reports . " some people thought , and think , that maria was n't informed about the rape , " he said monday , per ansa . " false ! maria knew everything because she had read it in the script , where it was described . the only novelty was the idea of the butter . " schneider , who died in 2011 , was 19 when the scene was shot with 48-year-old brando ; she said in 2007 that she " felt a little raped " by both men . the movie 's cinematographer , vittorio storaro , weighs in , telling the hollywood reporter that schneider loved being in the film and that the element of surprise was part of bertolucci 's moviemaking mo . " i was there with two cameras and nothing happened , " he says . " nobody was raping anybody . that was something made up by a journalist . " he adds bertolucci likely felt " a little guilty and nothing more than that " for not completely explaining the butter to schneider before the scene was shot . bertolucci also calls anyone who thought schneider was actually raped " naive " and the controversy " ridiculous . " " those who do n't know that in film , sex is [ almost ] always simulated , probably also think that every time john wayne fires , someone actually dies , " he said in the statement . he admitted in the 2013 interview that schneider " hated me for all of her life , " per the express . more from storaro .
