a 21-year-old former stanford student killed his 19-year-old ex-girlfriend and then himself with a " ghost gun , " say police . that phrase refers to a firearm that has no serial number , and the two " ghost guns " found on the scene in walnut creek , calif. , were homemade firearms built with parts bought online , the san francisco chronicle reports . police say scott bertics shot and killed clare orton on july 21 at her home ; the 19-year-old was on summer break from san diego state university , the mercury news reports . there was no serial number on either gun found at the scene . ( the chronicle notes that lower receivers on homemade guns normally bear the numbers , though " incomplete ones can be bought as just simple pieces of metal . " ) yesterday police revealed the firearms had been built by bertics—an engineering major who took a leave of absence from stanford in the fall—using parts he ordered off the internet . a person " can buy 80 % of a gun " online , says lt. lanny edwards , who added there is no evidence bertics did anything illegal to get the parts . the chronicle points out that california gov . jerry brown last year vetoed a bill that would have required any gun part sold online to have a serial number and background checks for anyone buying those parts , saying he did n't believe the bill would " significantly advance public safety . " police have so far not identified a motive in the killing of orton ; the two last dated in 2013 , the mercury news reports .
