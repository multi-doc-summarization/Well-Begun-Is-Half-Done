one reason it took the women in the cleveland kidnapping case so long to escape to the world just outside their door ? ariel castro would " test " them for just such a scenario , reports cnn . according to a law enforcement source , he would pretend to leave the house then return suddenly to check if any of the women had moved , punishing them if they had . even though the women watched the search efforts and vigils held for them on tv , they eventually " succumbed [ to ] their reality , " says the source . additionally , berry 's child , jocelyn , was not told michelle knight 's or gina dejesus ' real names , in case she mentioned them when castro took her out of the house , wkyc reports . when berry did make her brave escape , she was afraid to break the locked storm door open in case this was another " test . " a police report details their rescuers ' arrival on the scene : " as we neared the top of the steps , officer espada hollered out , 'cleveland police , ' at which time ... knight ran and threw herself into ( officer ) espada 's arms , " says the report . " we then asked if there was anyone else upstairs with her , when ( dejesus ) came out of the bedroom . " wkyc notes that a public fund has been set up to provide services for the women . castro , who has been formally charged , is due in court today .
