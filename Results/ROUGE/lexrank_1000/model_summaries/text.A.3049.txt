emma watson did n't even take her top all the way off , and people are freaking out . the beauty and the beast star posed for vanity fair wearing a sheer top that bared part of her breasts , and as sky news reports , the backlash was swift . " emma watson : 'feminism , feminism ... gender wage gap ... why oh why am i not taken seriously ... feminism ... oh , and here are my t -- s ! ' " tweeted daily mail columnist julia hartley-brewer in a typical example of the criticism that arose . in response to hartley-brewer 's tweet , times editor giles coren wrote ( but has apparently since deleted ) , " that dim-witted , attention-seeking hoyden does n't just give feminists a bad name , she gives the human race a bad name . " but others were quick to defend watson . " your mole would like to point out the irony in attempting to undermine the actor â€™ s feminist credentials by objectifying her body and criticising her choices , " the new statesman 's media mole blog states . " as if we needed any further proof of the need for feminism . " over at metro , olivia waring does have a problem with watson , but it has nothing to do with her choice of attire : " walt disney was famously conservative and actually pretty archaic in his views of what women should do with their lives , which was reflected in all of the traditional fairytales his company made . " not much has changed recently , she writes , so if we 're going to criticize watson about anything related to her feminist credentials , it should be her choice to work with disney . ( here 's why watson wo n't take selfies with fans . )
