another bain capital controversy for mitt romney : he may have still been involved with the private-equity firm when it invested $ 75 million in stericycle , a medical-waste disposal company that disposes of aborted fetuses , thus making it a target of anti-abortion activists . the huffington post first revealed the romney-stericycle connection , but bain kept it from blowing up into a controversy by claiming that romney left the firm in february 1999 , before the deal was made . but sec documents obtained by mother jones list romney as " sole shareholder , chairman , ceo , and president " of bain and as a definite participant in the deal—a deal that made him and his partners millions ; one document even includes his signature . the documents are relevant not only because of the abortion controversy , but because of romney 's departure from bain . he has used the official account of the timing of his exit to defend himself—not just with regard to the stericycle deal , but also with regard to the recent article about bain 's connections to major job outsourcing . in that case , the romney campaign noted that his february 1999 exit came at least a month before bain acquired two of the companies that outsourced jobs . but these documents indicate romney was still playing a role at the company until the end of that year . mother jones has a detailed look at the documents—as well as stericycle 's troubled safety record .
