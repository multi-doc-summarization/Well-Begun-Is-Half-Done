tmz is venturing well off the justin bieber beat with a potentially serious story about the behavior of marines during the iraq war . the site has published eight grisly photos that it says show us troops burning the corpses of iraqi insurgents in fallujah in 2004 , rifling through pockets , and mugging for the camera . it turned over the full set of 41 photos to the us military last week , and a pentagon spokesman says an investigation is under way , first to determine the veracity of the images and then to possibly identify any of the marines . if true , the behavior would violate the uniform code of military justice on the handling of bodies . " we have no details beyond the photos themselves , " a pentagon spokesperson tells the wire . in a fuller statement , the spokesperson says " the actions depicted in these photos are not what we expect from our service members . " charges could still be filed , even if any of the marines are no longer in the military . you can see the images at tmz , but , be warned , they are graphic . ( the development comes as fallujah continues to fall under the sway of al-qaeda . )
