the race between ted cruz and beto o'rourke in texas is emerging as one of the must-watch races of the midterms . cruz , of course , is the republican incumbent hoping to keep his senate seat , while o'rourke is a 45-year-old three-term congressman mounting a surprisingly strong challenge . a new poll by emerson college out this week has the race in a statistical dead heat , reports the hill , which notes that texas has not elected a democrat to the senate in three decades . here 's a look at the latest , including o'rourke 's growing national profile : rock star : the texas gop tweeted an old photo of o'rourke this week showing him back in the '90s with his old punk band , foss . the photo was meant to mock o'rourke , and some republicans think it did just that . " wearing a dress ? " tweeted one strategist . but an analysis at the washington post thinks the photo actually endeared o'rourke to far more people than it alienated . his " rock-star status is cemented by texas gop , handing dems an icon they desperately need , " reads the headline . oh , he skateboards , too .
