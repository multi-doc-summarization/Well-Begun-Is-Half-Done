president trump unleashed a twitter attack on mexico over the weekend , and he picked up right where he left off on monday morning . in multiple tweets , trump said mexico must do more to stop " caravans of people " heading into the us , blasted democrats for weak border laws , and again demanded his wall . in regard to those " caravans , " a reference to reports about a large group of central americans working their way northward through mexico : " they must stop them at their northern border , which they can do because their border laws work , not allow them to pass through into our country , which has no effective border laws , " trump wrote . the president made a point to include democrats in the blame game . " congress must immediately pass border legislation , use nuclear option if necessary , to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people , " he wrote . " border patrol agents ( and ice ) are great , but the weak dem laws don ’ t allow them to do their job . act now congress , our country is being stolen ! " he again brought up the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and reiterated that he was through trying to resurrect it . " daca is dead because the democrats didn ’ t care or act , and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon , " he wrote . " no longer works . must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation . democrats want no borders , hence drugs and crime ! "
