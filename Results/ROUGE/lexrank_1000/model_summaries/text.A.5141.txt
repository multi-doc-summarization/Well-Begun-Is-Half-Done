everyone knows smartphones can steal hours from a day , but employees are turning to their mobile devices while on the clock , too . a new survey by staffing firm officeteam finds that office workers spend an average of 56 minutes a day on their cell phones while at work , and another 42 minutes a day doing other personal tasks . that 's nearly five hours of personal phone time a week , and a total of more than eight hours of broader personal time , notes wtop . not only that , but most bosses underestimate the time waste on phones to be closer to 39 minutes a dayâ€”and workers younger than 35 are averaging a whopping 70 minutes of their day on their phones and 48 minutes on other personal matters . " it 's understandable that employees may occasionally use their mobile devices or attend to personal tasks during business hours , " officeteam 's ' district president says . " but these activities can easily become big distractions . " fortune reports that most of the personal time on phones is spent on social media and non-work email ; in distant third , fourth , and fifth places come sports sites , mobile gaming , and shopping . beyond this , the survey found that 58 % of office workers visit pages their company prohibits , but there 's a breakdown between the sexes : 68 % of men do this , compared to just 43 % of women . ( in the uk , some women get time off to cope with menstrual pain . )
