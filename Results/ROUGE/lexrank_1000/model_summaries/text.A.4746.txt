one of the two brothers who detonated a suicide bomb in brussels on monday was clearly worried about getting caught just prior to the attacks . authorities revealed a note written by ibrahim el bakraoui , 29 , that reads : " being in a hurry , i do n't know what to do , being searched for everywhere , not being safe . if it drags on it could end up with me in a prison cell next to him . " the " him " is believed to refer to salah abdeslam , the suspected terrorist ringleader arrested last week , reports usa today . the note was found on a computer that had been dumped into a street trash can outside an apartment building in brussels , reports abc news . a taxi driver led police to the building after realizing that he had driven el bakraoui and two others to the airport on monday morning . also on tuesday , authorities clarified some confusing earlier accounts of the investigation : they now say that ibrahim el bakraoui is the man seen in the middle of two others in a surveillance photo from the airport . on the left is a fellow suicide bomber , still unidentified , and on the right is another suspect , clad in white , who remains at large . some media reports have identified him as najim laachraoui , who is suspected of paying a role in the paris attacks , but authorities have not officially identified laachraoui as a suspect in brussels . ibrahim el bakraoui 's brother , khalid , 27 , meanwhile , is accused of detonating a suicide bomb on the brussels subway train . in another development , a turkish official says ibrahim el bakraoui was arrested in june at the turkey-syria border and deported to the netherlands . turkey then warned both the netherlands and belgium that he was a " foreign terrorist fighter , " reports ap .
