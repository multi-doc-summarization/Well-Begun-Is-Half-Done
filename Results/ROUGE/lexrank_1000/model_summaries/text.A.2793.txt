banks loaned ted cruz as much as $ 1 million during his first senate campaign in texas back in 2012 , but you would n't know it from campaign finance reports . while cruz eventually disclosed the loans from citibank and goldman sachs—each valued at $ 250,000 to $ 500,000—to senate officials , he failed to inform the federal election commission as required , reports the new york times . at the time , cruz spoke of how he and his wife put " our entire net worth " into the campaign . nbc news reports he used $ 1.43 million in personal funds . but " a review of personal financial disclosures that mr. cruz filed later with the senate does not find a liquidation of assets that would have accounted for all the money he spent on his campaign , " per the times . a cruz rep admits the goldman sachs loan was used for the senate race and a failure to disclose it was " inadvertent . " she did n't comment on the citibank loan , which the times notes would have freed up other assets even if it was n't used on cruz 's campaign . the times notes , too , that disclosing the loans might have hurt cruz 's campaign , given that he was criticizing wall street bailouts and big banks . cruz , who says the loans were borrowed against the couple 's own assets , cites a " filing error , " per nbc . " those loans have been disclosed over and over and over again on multiple filings , " he adds , per the wall street journal . " if it was the case that they were not filed exactly as the fec requires , then we 'll amend the filings . "
