researchers experimented with lsd in psychiatric treatment until such research was effectively banned in the us in 1966â€”but now a swiss psychiatrist has conducted the first controlled trial of the hallucinogenic drug in more than four decades , with us fda approval . dr. peter gasser 's study involved 12 people who were dying , most of terminal cancer , and suffering from " deep anxiety , " the seattle times reports . after undergoing talk therapy , eight of the patients were given a 200-microgram dose of lsd designed to " produce the full spectrum of a typical lsd experience " on two occasions ; the other four received a 20-microgram " active placebo " that was n't expected to have an impact . they took their 10-hour " trips " in gasser 's office , and , he says , " their anxiety went down and stayed down . " specifically , subjects who received full doses of lsd saw a 20 % improvement in their anxiety symptoms , and for those who were still alive a year later , the improvement had lasted , the new york times reports . those who took the placebo reported increased anxiety . it does n't sound like a comforting experience at first : the verge says the purpose of administering the psychedelic drug was to " facilitate discussions about the patients ' fears of dying , " and one patient reports that " the major part was pure distress at all these memories i had successfully forgotten for decades . these painful feelings , regrets , this fear of death . " but he talked about all that with gasser , something he 'd found difficult prior to the trip ; the times refers to such distress as " therapeutically valuable , " and many subjects had similar experiences . other than that , no serious side effects were seen .
