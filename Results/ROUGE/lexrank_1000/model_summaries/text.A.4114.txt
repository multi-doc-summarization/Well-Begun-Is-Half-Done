heartburn is a big problem in the us . in fact , proton pump inhibitors ( ppis ) , which are used to treat acid reflux and heartburn , are among the most prescribed drugs in the country , with millions taking them , and they 're becoming more widely available over-the-counter , reports cnn . but a preliminary report just released by the american heart association is concerned that the drug—already associated with a higher risk of heart attack and other vascular problems , as the aha reported earlier this year—may also increase one 's risk of ischemic stroke , the most common type caused when a clot cuts off blood flow to the brain . " at one time , ppis were thought to be safe , without major side effects , " the study 's lead author says . “ this study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs . " researchers followed nearly a quarter-million patients in denmark who were suffering from stomach pain and indigestion and had an endoscopy . their average age was 57 , and six years later those taking one of four ppis ( prilosec , protonix , prevacid , or nexium ) had a 21 % higher risk of stroke than those not taking one . lowest-dose ppis did n't increase the risk much if at all , while highest-dose increased it , from 30 % for prevacid to 94 % for protonix . another type of acid-lowering meds called h2 blockers ( think pepcid and zantac ) showed no elevated risk . " as a culture , we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems , when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals , drinking less alcohol , or not smoking , " one doc told cnn in 2010 . ( ppis are also associated with a higher risk of dementia . )
