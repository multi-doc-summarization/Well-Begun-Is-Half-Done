police have released surveillance video of kenneka jenkins , the chicago teen whose death in a walk-in hotel freezer after a party last weekend has led to protests and theories that she was murdered . the footage , which appears to be from a motion-activated camera at the crowne plaza hotel in rosemont , ill , does n't capture the moment the 19-year-old entered the freezer , but it shows her walking , alone and apparently disoriented , through a disused hotel kitchen on the way there , reports the chicago tribune . the video shows that nobody else entered the kitchen area until her frozen body was found early sunday morning , almost 24 hours after friends said she was missing . video from early in the evening shows jenkins with friends , but a later clip shows her emerge from an elevator alone and so unsteady that she had to hold on to a wall , the new york daily news reports . another shows her wandering down a hotel hallway . police say they have interviewed 25 party guests and they have no reason to believe jenkins was murdered , the chicago sun-times reports . sam adam jr. , an attorney for the jenkins family , says lawyers will carry out their own investigation . the hotel " never searched , they never did anything while a young , 19-year-old disoriented girl was sitting in their freezer , " he told reporters friday . " now there has to be an answer to how that happened . better yet , there has to be an answer to why that happened . "
