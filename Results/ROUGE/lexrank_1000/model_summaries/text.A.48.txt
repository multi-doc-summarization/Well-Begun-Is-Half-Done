millions of people flock to jerusalem 's church of the holy sepulchre each year . many believe it to house the tomb of jesus christ , though scientists have thus far been unable to date the tomb to the time when the romans built a church around it . now , however , a new series of tests " corroborates our historical accounts " as a national geographic writer puts it to nbc news . it 's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history : around ad 325 , experts believe roman emperor constantine the great arrived in jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to jesus ; his team identified the cave that they believed jesus was buried in and built a shrine ( known as the edicule ) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it . that church was destroyed in 1009 , recounts national geographic . it was rebuilt , and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuildingâ€”proving it was at most about 1,000 years old . the tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in october 2016 to allow for the edicule to be restored . a marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding , and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around ad 345 . national geographic 's take : " while it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual jew known as jesus of nazareth ... [ the ] results put the original construction of today 's tomb complex securely in the time of constantine . " ( scientists have issued a dire warning about the site . )
