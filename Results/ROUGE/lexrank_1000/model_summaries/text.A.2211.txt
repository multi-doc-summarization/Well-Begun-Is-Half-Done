winemakers have long understood that things like the soil in which grapes are grown can affect the flavor of the grapes and , ultimately the wine . now scientists have proof that a microbial component of " terroir " —wine lingo for the individual regional conditions—has an impact , too . reporting in the journal scientific reports , researchers say they isolated the six major related strains of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae ( yeast is a microbe , which the afp describes as a " brainless , single-celled organism " ) found at all six of new zealand 's wine-producing regions and inoculated those 36 strains into sterilized sauvignon blanc grape juice to begin the process of fermentation . " we controlled for absolutely everything else other than these microbes , " one researcher tells the scientist , " and then we asked : what are the wines that result from those strains ? " the intention was to see whether the genetic differences in the strains had an impact on the wine 's taste and smell , but instead of using subjective taste testing , the researchers chemically profiled the resulting wines . and while these signatures showed tons of overlap , they also betrayed regional distinctiveness , with the profiles of wines produced by yeast strains from the same region clustering together . it was n't the result study co-author matthew goddard was expecting . " the idea that microbes might play a role in terroir is new , " he tells afp , " and we think this is the first time that it has been experimentally shown that this is the case . " the researchers further determined that " most of the 'fruity ' notes in wine are in fact derived from yeast not the fruit . " ( read about three really detestable wine habits . )
