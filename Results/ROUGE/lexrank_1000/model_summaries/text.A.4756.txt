isis has reportedly lost one of its more unlikely members : sally jones , a former punk singer from britain who traveled to syria to become a recruiter for the group in 2013 . a british intelligence source tells the sun that jones was killed in june by a drone strike near syria 's border with iraq . " the americans zapped her trying to get away from raqqa . quite frankly , it 's good riddance , " the source says . jones , 50 , left the uk with her son to marry 21-year-old isis hacker junaid hussain , reports usa today , which describes her as britain 's most-wanted female terrorist . she became known as the " white widow " after hussain died in a drone strike in 2015 . jones ' death has not been confirmed , though the social media accounts she used to offer western women advice on joining isis and traveling to syria have been silent for months , the guardian reports . " you christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at raqqa ... come here i ’ ll do it for you , " she said in one post . jojo , jones ' 12-year-old son , may also have been killed in the airstrike . he was radicalized in syria and his grandparents identified him last year as an executioner seen in an isis video . authorities say they 're not sure if he was with jones—and the brainwashed boy was too young to be declared a target in any case .
