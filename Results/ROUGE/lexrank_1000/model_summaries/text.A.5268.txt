it 's only about 3 inches long , but the oregon chub is about to achieve a first among fish : it 's coming off the endangered species list , reports popular science . the fish and wildlife service announced the move yesterday , though it wo n't become official until after a 60-day period for public comment . that 's largely a formality , however . the minnow went on the list about 20 years ago , when only about 1,000 existed in eight locations in oregon . today , the population is at 180,000 in 80 locations throughout the state . " we 're not saying it wo n't need management , " says a fish and wildlife official . " but they can leave the hospital and get out to be an outpatient . " the fact that the chub is so small contributed to the success story , reports the ap . wildlife officials could find small places throughout the willamette valley to re-introduce it , unlike the larger-scale methods needed to protect , say , salmon . when the fish comes off the list , it will join 26 others animals that have done so , including the gray wolf , notes the verge .
