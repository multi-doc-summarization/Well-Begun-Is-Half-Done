over the weekend , tom hanks ' son used the n-word . twice . today he helpfully explained why no one should be upset about that . gawker , not surprisingly , was quick to report both incidents ( and to point out that chester hanks , or " chet haze , " as the self-styled rapper goes by , is in fact white ) . the rundown : on sunday , chet posted a photo of himself to instagram with a caption that said , among other things , " fuck yall hating ass [ n-word ] i 'll never stop chasing my dream . " the day prior to that , he had posted a photo of himself and a friendâ€”or , as he called it , " me and my [ n-word ] . " controversy ensued . ( sample headlines : " we need to talk about chet , " " chet haze , pretend rapper , is now spouting the n-word on instagram , " and " chet haze drops n-bombs on instagram , continues to suck . " ) this morning , haze posted another photo of himself to instagram along with his explanation . it starts : " if i say the word [ n-word ] i say it amongst people i love and who love me . " he goes on to explain the constitution : " i do n't accept society getting to decide what anybody can or ca n't say . that 's something we call free speech . " the history lesson continues : " now i understand the older generation who grew up in the jim crowe era might have strong feelings against this . " but , as he explains , it 's 2015 now and the n-word is " a word that unifies the culture of hip-hop across all races , which is actually kind of a beautiful thing . "
