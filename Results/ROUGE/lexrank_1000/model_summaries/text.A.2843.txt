" we see progress not only in looks and behavior but also in de-domestication of the animals , " says goderie , noting one herd has learned to defend itself against wolves . the hope is that they will become part of the ecosystem to maintain land for other animals . but a rep for the international union for the conservation of nature says it 's unclear " whether primarily wetland forests like the aurochs used to inhabit still exist , whether it could negatively impact wild or domestic plants or animals , and if it might endanger people . " indeed , a british farmer had to kill some of his aurochs-descended cattle in 2015 because they tried to kill him , per the independent . that species , however , came from a nazi breeding program that used spanish fighting cattle .
