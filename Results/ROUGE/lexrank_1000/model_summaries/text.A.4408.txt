a " gun joke " involving palace sis-in-law pippa middleton is causing a royal stir . the driver of a car that pippa , 28 , was riding in smilingly pointed what looked like a gun at pestering paparazzi in paris over the weekend . now he says he was just goofing around , and the gun was n't real . " it was not a real gun . it was just a stupid joke , " said a representative . the french are n't laughing , though , especially in the wake of the shocking shootings in toulouse last month . paris authorities warned that everyone in the car ( including grinning pippa ) could face arrest and even two years in prison . " anybody involved in the illegal use of a handgun in public is liable to arrest and interrogation , " a source told the sun . but so far , no one has filed a complaint , and the " targeted " photographer did n't feel threatened , reports abc . the driver has n't yet been identified . her royal hotness was in the front passenger 's seat , and sitting in the back were two men , including aristocrat fashion designer viscount arthur de soultrait , whose wild birthday party pippa attended ( for photos , check here ) . buckingham palace reps are keeping mum , saying pippa is a " private individual " and not their concern .
