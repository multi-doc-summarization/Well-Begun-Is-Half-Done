" prankster " may not be the first word that comes to mind when describing a scientist , but a group of them at switzerland 's european organization for nuclear research ( aka cern ) may have just elevated the term in an odd and creepy way . the guardian reports the research organization is looking into a video that popped up online last week showing what appears to be a mock human sacrifice , filmed in the dead of night at cern 's geneva headquarters ( where the large hadron collider is housed ) . the blair witch-style tape , shot from the pov of a person watching from a window above one of the lab 's main squares , shows a woman in white being pretend-stabbed amid a group of black-cloaked mysteriosos ( the independent notes one appears to be wearing hiking boots ) in front of a statue of the hindu deity shiva . " these scenes were filmed on our premises but without official permission or knowledge , " a cern rep informed afp via email , adding the organization frowns upon such a " spoof " as it can " give rise to misunderstandings about the scientific nature of our work . " snopes notes cern and the large hadron collider have become " conspiracy magnets " because of the complicated research there , with some even insisting that scientists are plotting to take over the earth or open a portal to hell . although the video raises concern about campus security , the lab 's rep stresses that entry to the campus is secure and that the disguised occult wannabes must have had access badges . " cern welcomes every year thousands of scientific users from all over the world , and sometimes some of them let their humor go too far , " she says . ( cern has been trying to keep satan at arm 's length . )
