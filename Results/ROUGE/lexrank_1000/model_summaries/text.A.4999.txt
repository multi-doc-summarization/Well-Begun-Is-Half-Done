talk about being too good at your non-job . a harvard university junior lost his facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network 's messenger system . aran khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in harvard 's technology science journal . " from 2011 to the start of this study in may 2015 , facebook messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the android mobile app , " he writes . the flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat , even if the person who sent the message was n't friends with everyone else in the group . and so khanna developed a browser app called marauder 's map that exposed , on a map , the geo-location data that was being shared . he tweeted about his chrome extension and posted about it on medium on may 26 . by the 28th , cnn , the washington post , and many others had covered his findings ; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times . that same day , facebook asked khanna to disable the app ; he did . the company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a june 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing . it also withdrew khanna 's internship , which was to start on june 1 . the official reason given was a violation of the " high ethical standards expected of interns , " according to boston.com . " this mapping tool scraped facebook data in a way that violated our terms , " a facebook rep tells the site . khanna says his app was created using his own messenger history , not data scraping . " i did n't write the program to be malicious , " he says . khanna ended up securing an internship with another silicon valley firm . ( this alleged intern tale of woe involves the olsen twins . )
