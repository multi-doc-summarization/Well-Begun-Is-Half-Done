researchers think they 've at long last solved , at least partially , the mystery of so-called " flying snakes . " the five species of chrysopelea do n't actually fly , but they 're impressive gliders , capable of sailing up to 100 feet through the air . until now , scientists did n't know how they managed it , but now they think they do : as the snakes jump , they flatten out their ribs and contort themselves into an s-shape that sorta kinda resembles a flying saucer , livescience reports . " you never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer ; you do n't find it in engineered flyers , " says one study co-author . " we did n't know if that was a good shape to have . " the snake 's body develops a curve a little like an airplane wing , the bbc explains , which coupled with its undulating movements generates lift . researchers hit on the discovery using 3d-printed models in tanks of water , national geographic reports . but observations of real snakes indicate that they 're even better gliders than the model suggested , meaning some aspect of their prowess remains unexplained . ( in another recent animal-kingdom discovery , meet the world 's new toad . )
