for anyone encouraged by north korea 's slight softening toward the south , chun in-bum essentially dumps a bucket of cold water it . the retired south korean general , who the financial times reports led his country 's special forces , spoke to a london-based think tank wednesday and outlined exactly what american forces would encounter should we decide to bloody the country 's nose—or something more significant . he does n't mince words : " i try to explain to the americans—if we have to go into north korea , ... it ’ s not going to be like toppling [ saddam ) hussein ] . this would be more like trying to get rid of allah . " he describes the country as " one huge barracks " and the population as militarized far beyond the [ west 's ] imagination . " a 14-year-old child in north korea probably gets more than 100 hours of military training a year , " the times of london quotes chun as saying . " by age 14 , a child knows how to fire an ak47 , fire an rpg , throw a grenade , pitch a tent and march 24 hours . " and even things that may seem promising on their face—the north 's estimated 1,000 fighter jets are aged—are n't , per chun , who says those planes would be used kamikaze-style , usa today reports . and there 's not just the physical battlefield to contend with , per the brisbane times : " north korean cyber capability is right below nuclear capability in terms of threat , " says chun . he also describes an extreme system designed to root out any dissent , whereby the country 's families are grouped in units , and if one person " misbehaves , the entire five or 10 families go to the gulag or are executed . so everybody spies on everybody else .
