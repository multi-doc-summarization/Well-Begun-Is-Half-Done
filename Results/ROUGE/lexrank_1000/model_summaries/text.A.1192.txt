if i stay tells the story of a teen girl with a big future who 's nearly killed in a car crash . informed by out-of-body experiences , she must decide whether to stick around on earth or head to heaven . it 'll make you cry , but it does n't offer much otherwise , critics say . ( audiences , however , seem to disagree : 80 % like it at rotten tomatoes , twice the figure for critics ) . some examples : it 's up to audiences " whether the movie 's many moments of genuine sweetness and affecting tenderness can survive the persistent silliness of mia 's out-of-body excursions , " writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal . " at its best , if i stay evokes the primacy of friendship , the warmth of family … and the urgency of adolescent love . but the production as a whole is awfully clumsy . " " full disclosure : i went through half a pack of kleenex watching if i stay , " writes elizabeth weitzman in the new york daily news . " but know this : those tears are no more honestly earned than if director rj cutler had merely been chopping onions in front of me . … the movie is designed not to explore the experience of illness , or first love , or adolescence , but merely to make us swoon , sigh , and sob . " the movie " hews largely to the same formula as the fault in our stars , " another book-based film dealing with teens facing death , notes ann hornaday in the washington post . but if i stay offers " the perfect bookend to a tear-stained summer " : " even at its most wrenchingly painful , the film readily delivers generous dollops of pleasure . " in the los angeles times , kenneth turan calls the film " a flat-out , all-in fantasy romance , an unashamed tear-jerker that is unafraid of glossy emotions . " sure , " every moment in if i stay is not all that it might be " —but when its leads " are looking into each other 's eyes , you are not going to care . "
