there 've been no shortage of complaints about how the media is handling the candidacy of donald trumpâ€”but now one media outlet is putting its advertising revenue where its mouth is and axing a deal to run ads this fall from the republican national committee . that outlet is buzzfeed , and in an email to employees monday morning , company ceo jonah peretti outlined the reasons it has nixed what a source tells politico was a $ 1.3 million ad buy promoting trump . " the trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the united states and around the world and in some cases , such as his proposed ban on international travel for muslims , would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs , " peretti writes , explaining the deal was originally signed in april , before trump became the presumptive nominee . although peretti notes that buzzfeed staff " certainly do n't like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company , " he adds that " the tone and substance of his campaign are unique in the history of modern us politics " and that an exception must be made . " we do n't run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health , and we wo n't accept trump ads for the exact same reason , " he writes . ben smith , buzzfeed 's editor-in-chief , says that editorial coverage of trump will continue as usual , noting in his own email : " this was jonah 's call , and the prerogative of a publisher .
