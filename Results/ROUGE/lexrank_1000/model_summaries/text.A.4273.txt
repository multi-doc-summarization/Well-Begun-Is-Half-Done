a new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads : higher iqs . more specifically , they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the " geek index , " reports the guardian . and this is clearly seen as a positive : " if you look at who does well in life right now , it ’ s geeks , " says magdalena janecka at king ’ s college london . the geek index , she explains , is determined by such factors as ability to focus , non-verbal iq scores taken at age 12 , and social aloofness . the latter trait may sound like a negative , but the bbc frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in . a mother 's age appears to have no impact . the team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the uk . the average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39 . it goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44 , and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older . the impact was less pronounced on girls , and more pronounced when measuring science , tech , engineering , and math scores . kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32 % more likely to earn at least two a 's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25 , the researchers report in translational psychiatry . they calculate that 57 % of the geek index score is inherited , with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism . “ our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘ geeky ’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves , " janecka tells newsweek . " men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits , and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘ geekiness. ’ ” ( younger fathers are also likelier to die younger . )
