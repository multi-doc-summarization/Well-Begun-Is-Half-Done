an australian school teacher says she 's had 136 dates over 17 months but never a second dateâ€”because the mutual attraction just is n't there , e ! news reports . " i know who i am and what i want and i just ca n't find a man who is worthy of my time and attention , " says 35-year-old belinda stuckey . " now that is not meant to sound aggressive . it is more about being confident in who i am and knowing myself . " after a four-year relationship , stuckey says she joined eharmony and became one of its most popular members , matching with 4,700 men since 2013 . but either they do n't call her after dates , the mirror reports , or she 's just not interested . " i have found that men here are becoming more and more feminine not just in looks , but in demeanor too , " she says . " i need and want a man 's man . someone who can make a decision at least ! " either that , she says , or they just want to fool around : " they are more concerned about finding someone to sleep with than someone to get to know and love . what has happened to society ? " she asks . " in sydney at least . " but she seems to be keeping a positive attitude , concluding that " rejection is inevitable and think of each date as a new experience and a learning tool . " ( meanwhile , we seem to really love going to chain restaurants on first dates . )
