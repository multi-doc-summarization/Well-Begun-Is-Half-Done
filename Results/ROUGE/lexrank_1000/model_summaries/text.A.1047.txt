a councilwoman in tempe , ariz. , thought her dog fell off the bed sunday nightâ€”but the cause of the rumble and thud she heard turned out to be more earthshaking than that . at least three earthquakes startled the grand canyon state sunday night , with the largest weighing in at a 4.1 magnitude , the arizona republic reports . the tremors , a relatively rare occurrence in arizona , were all near black canyon city , about 45 miles north of phoenix , notes cnn . even though a us geological survey rep says the 4.1 quake was " relatively small , " two things made it stand out , per the republic : the fact that a 3.2-magnitude temblor came right before it , and that the quakes hit close to the earth 's surface . " this is definitely not common , " he says . ( meanwhile , the bay area has been shaken by 408 quakes in two weeks . )
