the us open broadcast on fox sports took a strange turn friday when a microphone inadvertently picked up a guy bragging about rough sex with his " ex , " the sporting news reports . announcer joe buck was setting up a shot by golfer patrick reed at around 1:45pm est when the surprise voices emerged . " here at one , it 's patrick reed , " said buck , and a mic picked up a man talking to his male companion , per awful announcing . " we were -- -ing so hard , and i headbutted her in the head , " the man said , among other things , but the other does n't sound convinced : " yeah , what actually happened , pal ? " the first one protests , " no , straight up ... " and his words soon turn indistinct . buck 's voice returned with " second shot , " as if all was normal , and the broadcast continued . " from the sound , it seems likely this was a radio conversation that somehow got picked up onto the actual feed , rather than just crowd chatter , but we don â€™ t know for sure , " says awful announcing . ( you can hear the actual exchange at deadspin . ) now fox sports and the united states golf association are apologizing for the unexpected interlude . " we deeply regret the inappropriate language and sentiment expressed by a few fans that was unfortunately picked up by a microphone , " says a usga spokeswoman .
