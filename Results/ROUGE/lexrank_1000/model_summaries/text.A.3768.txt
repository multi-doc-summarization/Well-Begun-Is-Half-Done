if you were thinking of designing an aircraft shaped sort of like an enormous doughnut , we have some bad news for you : airbus has already called it . the company has filed a patent application for a passenger aircraft in that very shape , the financial times reports . why go for the doughnut look ? well , current aircraft face heavy pressure on their front and rear ends , requiring special support . " the purpose of the invention is particularly to provide a simple , economic , and efficient solution to these problems , " airbus says . the new design , which you can view here , also offers more room for passengers , cnbc reports . the " doughnut " does , of course , have its drawbacks . boarding hatches—in the doughnut 's " hole " —do n't clearly fit emergency exit rules , fortune notes , and the aircraft 's shape might require airport redesigns . either way , do n't expect dunkin ' donuts to start an airline anytime soon . " it ’ s just one of many ideas , ” an airbus rep tells fortune . " it doesn ’ t mean that we ’ re going to be working on making it a reality . " in fact , the company seeks more than 600 patents yearly , the rep tells the publication ( though the financial times puts the figure at 6,000 ) . for instance , airbus recently sought a patent for standing " seats " that are basically bike saddles . ( if that 's not quite your desired comfort level , maybe try a flying three-room suite . )
