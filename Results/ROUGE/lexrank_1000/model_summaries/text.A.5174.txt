the jimmy kimmel-bill cassidy dust-up over health care circled back to kimmel thursday , the third night in a row that the late-night host has taken on the louisiana senator over the latter 's bill with sen. lindsey graham to replace obamacare . per ew , kimmel addressed president trump at the outset , noting that the commander in chief 's aim is dumping obamacare , " which he hates , primarily because obama 's name is on it . â€¦ he 'd sign copies of the koran at the barnes and noble in fallujah if it meant he could get rid of obamacare . " kimmel did have praise to offer for cassidy , a doctor who started a community clinic in his home state . " he 's done good things ; i just want him to keep doing good things . this plan is not a good thing , " said kimmel , who then rattled off the doctor-tied organizations , including the ama , that have come out against the bill . although some media sources have given kimmel a thumbs-up for his understanding of the legislation , the national review has jumped into the fray , calling the host a " policy wonk wannabe " and asserting that " comedians are not public intellectuals . " " does kimmel want a career change ? " writes theodore kupfer . " or does hollywood simply want to feel better about its propensity to wax earnest about complicated public-policy questions ? " some are coming to kimmel 's defense with clips of the conservative-leaning fox news interviewing other celebrities on various topics . kimmel wrapped up his latest launch against cassidy by addressing critics . " some people tell me i should give him the benefit of the doubt , " he said . " and you know what , i do give him the benefit of the doubt : i doubt all the benefits he claims are part of the new health care bill . " the whole clip here .
