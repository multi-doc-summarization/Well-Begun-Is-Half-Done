the cause of jane austen 's death at age 41 in 1817 has been an enduring mystery of the literary world . the legendary author 's own letters complain of ill health , and experts have used them to suggest a number of possible culprits , from stomach cancer to hodgkin 's lymphoma , the washington post reports . now , a trio of eyeglasses found in austen 's desk could hold a more intriguing answer . the spectacles of increasing strength indicate austen suffered from progressive eye problems ; indeed , the pride and prejudice author notes her " weak " eyes in her missives . austen may have suffered from an underlying health problem that attacked her vision , writes british library curator sandra tuppen , who theorizes slow-growing cataracts might have been caused by accidental arsenic poisoning . the toxic metal was common in 19th-century england , tainting medicine , water , and even wallpaper . other causes such as diabetes would have killed austen more quickly , says tuppen . the debate over austen 's death dates back to 1964 , when an english doctor argued the culprit was the adrenal disorder addison 's disease . then crime writer lindsay ashford floated the arsenic theory in a 2011 novel , citing the skin discoloration that austin notes late in her life . " i think it â€™ s highly likely she was given a medicine containing arsenic , " says ashford . " when you look at her list of symptoms and compare them to the list of arsenic symptoms , there is an amazing correlation . " but austen scholar janine barchas , who has her own forthcoming report on the glasses , calls the arsenic theory " reckless , " per the new york times . " we look forward to further discussions and debate on this topic , " writes tuppen . ( an unfinished austen manuscript sold for $ 1.6 million . )
