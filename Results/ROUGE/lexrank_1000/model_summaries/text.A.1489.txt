ron desantis swears he meant nothing racist by his " monkey this up " comment , but a new robocall in the florida gubernatorial race definitely did : set to the background of jungle music and screeching monkeys , the new york times reports that the minute-long audio clip begins with a man saying , " i is andrew gillum . we negroes . . . done made mud huts while white folk waste a bunch of time making their home out of wood an stone . " the call , which went out to an unknown number of recipients , is apparently the work of an idaho-based white supremacist , anti-semitic group called the road to power . the group is also behind an effort in iowa to drive anti-immigration policy in response to the killing of mollie tibbetts . a rep for desantis called the ad " appalling and disgusting . hopefully , whoever is behind this has to answer for this despicable action . " the gillum camp called it " reprehensible , " while asking the washington post to " please do n't give it undeserved attention . " current gov . rick scott joined the men seeking to replace him in denouncing the ad in a tweet : " there is no room for any racial politics here in florida â€” none . florida is a melting pot of people from all over the globe , and we are proud of it . no attempts to divide people by race or ethnicity will be tolerated , from anyone . this . stops . now . "
