jcpenney , drunk tweeter ? nah , it turns out the company 's retail twitter account was just pulling our collective leg—and attracting a little attention—by tweeting silly things , adweek reports . but it 's kinda funny to see how the tweets drew the doritos and kia social media teams into taking potshots : jcpenney : who kkmew theis was ghiong tob e a baweball ghamle . # lowsscorinh 5_0 jcpenney : toughdown seadawks ! ! is sseattle going toa runaway wit h this ? ? ? kia : hey @ jcpenney need a designated driver ? doritos : slow down , @ jcpenney . have some # doritos . jcpenney : oops ... sorry for the typos . we were # tweetingwithmittens . was n't it supposed to be colder ? enjoy the game ! # goteamusa . yes , it was all to promote mittens . very clever , jcp . but they 're not always so funny : the twitter stunt comes right after the retailer raised prices just to lower them for valentine 's day , reports latin times . jcpenney has been accused of such " price anchoring " several times over the years .
