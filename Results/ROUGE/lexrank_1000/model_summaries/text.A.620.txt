it 's been awhile since " brian williams " and " controversy " have been uttered in the same sentence , but might as well take a crack at it again now that we 're solidly in 2017 . the msnbc newscaster was among those providing commentary thursday night after the us launched dozens of tomahawk missiles at a syrian airfield , and while responses to the strike ran the gamut from " decisive " to " unlawful , " williams used a descriptor that few ( if any others ) did , per adweek . " i am tempted to quote the great leonard cohen : ' i am guided by the beauty of our weapons , ' " williams waxed poetic ( variety notes it 's a line from cohen 's " first we take manhattan " ) , as a video in the background showed the missiles hurtling from the us warships toward land . " they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments making what is for them what is a brief flight over to this airfield , " he continued . but instead of swooning over his lyrical analysis , most of the internet came down on williams for what appeared to be a glamorization of a wartime maneuver . one commenter called it " obscene enjoyment , " while matt pearce of the los angeles times called the segment " surreal . " others called williams a " dope " or said he should be fired again . one person who did n't seem to mind williams ' take : malcolm nance , the intel expert who was on air with williams during his soliloquy-like sermon . " he has an extremely calming effect in serious crises , " tweeted nance . ( congress members are split on how they feel about the strike . )
