elon musk 's dream of building a hyperloop that can move people between washington , dc , and new york city in 29 minutes may be a small step closer to becoming a distant reality . a nov. 29 permit issued by dc 's department of transportation allows musk 's boring company to dig at an abandoned lot beside a mcdonald 's in northeast washington that the company says might eventually become a station on a hyperloop connecting nyc , philadelphia , baltimore , and washington . the system would speed up travel times , using electricity and electromagnetic levitation to send people and cars whipping through tunnels in pods . but before you ditch your car , the washington post points out the permit is only for " some preparatory and excavation work " at the site , and more permits are needed before any real construction begins . dc mayor muriel bowser has visited a test tunnel musk is constructing under los angeles . but though " we 're open to the concept of moving people around the region more efficiently ... we 're just beginning , in the mayor 's office , our conversation to get an understanding of what the general vision is for hyperloop , " says bowser 's chief of staff , john falcicchio . still , the permit " is comparable to an athlete stretching before a race " and shows musk is serious about moving forward with his plans for high-speed travel since claiming " verbal " government support for an east coast hyperloop last july , reports techcrunch . he 's also received a conditional permit to build a tunnel beneath maryland route 295 in hawthorne , per the post , with maryland officials saying a leg linking washington and baltimore will come first .
