50 cent might have stretched the truth a bit in court when he told a lawyer all his lamborghinis , bentleys , and rolls royces were rented . new bankruptcy filings show he actually owns seven cars , including a rolls royce and three chevy suburbans , worth $ 500,000 , report people and page six . but apparently he still does n't have a ton of cash to throw around—relatively speaking , anyway . the ap reports the rapper pulls in about $ 185,000 per month but has $ 108,000 in monthly expenses , including $ 72,000 a month for the utilities , mortgage , property tax , and insurance on his 50-room hartford mansion . where else is his money going ? he spends $ 9,000 on security , $ 5,000 on gardening , $ 1,000 on grooming , and $ 3,000 on his wardrobe each month . another $ 5,745 goes toward a car lease , while $ 14,600 is used to support his two children and grandfather . on top of all that , he reportedly owes his stylist $ 5,245 in back pay , as well as unspecified debts to his barber and personal trainer . his biggest debt of all : $ 18 million to electronics company sleek audio—the result of a lawsuit over a failed headphones deal—in addition to the $ 7 million 50 cent has been ordered to pay in a sex-tape lawsuit . the rapper is due back in court tomorrow .
