research led by an oxford scientist has suggested there could be something to legends of the yeti , even if it 's not quite the creature legends would suggest . bryan sykes has argued , based on genetic analysis , that two hair samples collected by yeti enthusiasts in the himalayas could indeed point to an animal we did n't know existed today , though it would be something like an ancient polar bear rather than something like bigfoot . but eliécer e. gutiérrez of the smithsonian institution and ronald pine at the university of kansas are now raining—or perhaps snowing—on sykes ' parade , nbc news reports . they write in a study at zookeys that there 's not enough information to suggest the hairs were from an unknown species : " we have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than brown bears . " gutiérrez and pine were bothered by sykes ' use of just a " very short fragment " of the sequenced gene to arrive at his conclusion . livescience reports they determined the samples could have come from a brown bear or polar bear ; based on the himalayan location , the brown bear is the likely source , they maintain . theirs is the second study to question sykes ' findings : the bbc reported in december that another group of researchers found that a brown bear subspecies was the source of the hairs . but sykes is n't giving up just yet . he calls the new research " entirely statistical , " noting " the only way forward is to find a living bear that matches the ( genetic material ) and study fresh material from it . which involves getting off your butt , not an activity i usually associate with desk-bound molecular taxonomists , " he tells nbc . read more on where sykes got his samples .
