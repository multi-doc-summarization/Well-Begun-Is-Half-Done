lincoln chafee is saying what everybody was thinking : he 's out of the race for president . the former rhode island governor made it official friday morning in an address to the women 's leadership forum . " as you know i have been campaigning on a platform of 'prosperity through peace , ' " he said , per cnn . " but after much thought i have decided to end my campaign for president today . i would like to take this opportunity one last time to advocate for a chance [ to ] be given to peace . " two big reasons he dropped out : he was somewhere between 0 % and 1 % in the polls , and he 'd raised only $ 30,000 , reports the new york times . unlike jim webb , chafee is n't interested in an independent bid , and his departure leaves hillary clinton , bernie sanders , and martin o'malley in the democratic contest . ( clinton seems only to have strengthened her campaign after thursday 's marathon grilling over benghazi . )
