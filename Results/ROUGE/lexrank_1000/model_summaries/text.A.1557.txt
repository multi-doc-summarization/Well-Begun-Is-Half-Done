on some 20 acres of the 164-acre university of mississippi medical center campus , there 's something unexpected underfoot : bodies . the clarion-ledger reports there are as many as 7,000 bodies buried on the campus , and they likely belong to patients of the mississippi state lunatic asylum , which in 1855 opened as the state 's first mental institution . during the course of 2012 road construction , 66 bodies were uncovered on campus . " in size , they are fairly uniform , " wrote the school of the pine coffins that were discovered , " about six feet long but alarmingly narrow , as if each held a pair of stilts instead of a human skeleton . " the newspaper in 2014 reported a subsequent 1,000 were found when the school did radar testing in preparation for the construction of a parking garage in a wooded area near the dental school . the number of coffins verified by radar is now double that figure , with estimates topping out at 7,000 . the number is the problem : engaging an outside company to handle the exhumations and reburials would cost $ 3,000 each , or up to $ 21 million . so ummc is weighing doing it itself in an 8-year effort that would cost closer to $ 3 million . it 's possible that in addition to a memorial , a lab would be created that would allow researchers to study the remains and gain insight into asylum living ; the asylum was operational until 1935 , and the school opened 20 years later .
