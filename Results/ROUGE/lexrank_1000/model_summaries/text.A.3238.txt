james carville offered an entertainingly disparaging take on the gop presidential race today , saying that nothing stood in mitt romney ’ s way to getting the nomination—he may be a “ serial windsock , ” constantly changing his positions , but his opponents are inept . “ the best thing rick perry can do for himself and his family and his friends is get out of the race and go back to texas , ” carville told george stephanopoulos on good morning america . “ this man is evidently not up to this. ” as for herman cain , carville said , he “ says funny things ” but “ is not gon na be the republican nomination for president. ” politico was especially struck by carville ’ s reaction to cain ’ s bizarre smoking aide ad . “ if that guy wasn ’ t drunk , i haven ’ t taken a drink in my life ! ” carville declared . “ he was drunk or stoned . you know , some kind of chemical , i guarantee you that. ” stephanopoulos just laughed—as mediaite notes , the two were cohorts during bill clinton 's campaign and administration , so there 's a whiff of liberal bias here .
