anthony weiner 's sexting wrecked his political career , his comeback attempt , his media career , and his marriage—and now even his freedom could be at stake . the ap reports that the former congressman 's alleged online relationship with a 15-year-old girl is being investigated by authorities in new york and in north carolina , where the girl lives . a spokeswoman for the us attorney 's office in north carolina says they 've " begun investigative efforts , " and sources tell cnn that prosecutors in new york have already subpoenaed the 52-year-old 's phone records and other communication . an fbi task force in new york is also looking into the matter , a law enforcement source says . according to the daily mail , which first reported weiner 's communication with the underage girl , weiner 's explicit messages included one where he told the high school sophomore he would " make her limp for a week . " the girl says weiner—who allegedly called himself " t dog " this time instead of " carlos danger " —asked her to undress and touch herself , and the new york daily news notes that encouraging a child under 17 to " engage in a sexual performance " can carry a 15-year sentence in new york . weiner has admitted communicating with the girl and demonstrating " terrible judgment " online , but he also claims to have been " the subject of a hoax .
