as texas still deals with the devastation from harvey , another weather system churning in the atlantic , and moving west toward the us , has some worried . cnn reports on irma , currently a category 3 hurricane that experienced " rapid intensification " from wednesday into thursday , meaning its wind speed ramped up at least 35mph in that period—though the national hurricane center on thursday noted the " remarkable " increase measured 58mph . a national hurricane center alert issued early friday pegs maximum sustained winds at 115mph , with higher gusts . the storm is expected to approach the caribbean by tuesday or so as a category 4 storm , then possibly the us—though meteorological models with wildly different scenarios show it 's too early to make any definitive predictions on where the storm will land . irma is what 's called a " cape verde " hurricane , meaning one that forms off the coast of africa then shoots across the atlantic ; cnn notes these storm systems can turn into particularly powerful ones ( hurricane hugo is one example ) . what 's emboldening irma is a lack of the " hurricane kryptonite " known as wind shear , which often acts to tamp down hurricanes . a powerful high-pressure ridge is pushing irma westward and keeping wind shear low . what one of the models is showing that has some concerned , per reuters : irma could head straight into the gulf of mexico , which could be bad news for areas still struggling after harvey . " all interests in the eastern caribbean will need to monitor the progress of this evolving and dangerous hurricane , " an accuweather hurricane expert notes , reiterating he ca n't say " with certainty " how the us will be affected .
