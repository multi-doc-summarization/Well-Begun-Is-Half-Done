sometimes goliath beats david—or vernon , as the case may be . seventy-six-year-old farmer vernon hugh bowman has lost his supreme court battle with monsanto over his use of patented soybean seeds , the new york times reports . the court upheld an $ 84,000 lawsuit brought against bowman by the agribusiness giant for growing and saving its seeds without paying a fee . bowman had obtained the seeds from a grain elevator intended for animal feed , and argued that a doctrine called " patent exhaustion " allowed him to do as he pleased with the grain once he had purchased it . this may be true if he wanted to eat the seeds , but justice elena kagan ruled that it does not extend to growing more seeds and replanting them without paying monsanto for their use . but this case was about more than a few soybeans . other industries with self-replicating products—from biotechnology to software—were paying close attention to see if their patents would remain safe , usa today reports . but kagan warned the outcome of this one case did not necessarily assure their futures . " our holding today is limited , " she wrote . " we recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent , complex , and diverse . in another case , the article 's self-replication might occur outside the purchaser ’ s control . or it might be a necessary but incidental step in using the item for another purpose .
