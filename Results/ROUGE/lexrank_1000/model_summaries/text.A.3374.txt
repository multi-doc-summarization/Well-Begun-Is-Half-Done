last year , an american artist living in germany bought rosa parks ' dilapidated home in detroit and reassembled it in berlin as an art project . now ryan mendoza says it 's time for the home to return to the us , per the detroit free press . he cites the recent racial violence in virginia and the rippling effects of the removal of confederate statues around the us , making the case that parks ' home would provide a powerful counterpoint . " there are very , very few monuments to the civil rights movement , " he tells the free press . the big hitch , however , is getting someone , or some institution , to pay for its relocation . mendoza says that detroit 's cultural institutions do n't seem interested , raising the prospect that the home could end up in a museum elsewhere in the country . so far , one group—the nash family foundation in new york—has pledged up to $ 40,000 , but while other institutions have expressed interest in displaying the 21-by-21-foot-long home , actual monetary offers are n't following . mendoza says he 's spent about $ 130,000 to move and restore the house , though the interior work is n't yet complete . " i 'm fond of the house , " he tells nbc news , " but this house has to go back to the united states , and now is the time . " ( the late founder of little caesar 's quietly paid parks ' rent for years . )
