president trump is about to dredge up what the guardian says was a " low point " in his relationship with kim jong un , but this time around as a wry attempt to suggest " no harm , no foul " to the north korean leader . at least , that 's what appears to be the reason behind a gift trump is reportedly giving kim , to be delivered via secretary of state mike pompeo while he 's in north korea this week : a cd with elton john 's song " rocket man , " per the chosun ilbo 's sources . late last year , trump often referred to kim—and not in a complimentary way—as " rocket man " or " little rocket man " in tweets and speeches , leading kim to fire back that trump was a " mentally deranged us dotard . " apparently the " rocket man " epithet came up when the two leaders met at last month 's summit in singapore , and trump discovered that kim had never heard the elton john song . and so the cd ( reportedly signed by trump ) ended up in pompeo 's luggage , along with a letter to kim . gizmodo , which calls " rocket man " a " damn good song , " notes trump seems fixated on the 1972 hit , which became a staple of sorts at his rallies while he was campaigning for the presidency . on thursday , trump once again referenced the british superstar , per billboard , noting at a rally in montana that " i 've broken more elton john [ attendance ] records , and i do n't have a musical instrument . … this is my only musical instrument—the mouth—and hopefully the brain is attached to the mouth . the brain is so much more important .
