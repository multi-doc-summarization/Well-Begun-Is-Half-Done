thanks to a team of researchers from belgium , we may be close to synthesizing and , yes , possibly even bottling and selling the smell of human death , discovery reports . eva cuypers and her team at the university of leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals , placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months . by collecting the gases building up in the jars , researchers identified 452 organic compounds , according to science . eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs , and five of them were unique to humans . these five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles , carbohydrates , and fat , discovery reports . the esters create a " singular chemical cocktail " in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells , including other dead animals , science reports . cuypers and her team published their findings last week . they believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job . and discovery points out the synthetic smell of decomposing human bodies could prove popular at halloween parties . experts have questioned components of the research—including the separation of tissue and organs—and cuypers plans a follow-up study using full bodies buried in a field , science reports . ( the smell of corpses can also reveal when a person died . )
