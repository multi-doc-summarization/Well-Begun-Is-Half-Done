about a year after hollywood reporter journalist gary baum profiled angelyne , the mysterious billboard bombshell he describes as la 's " modern myth , " a hobbyist genealogist contacted him claiming to have proof of a compelling back story : that she was born in poland to holocaust survivors . now , also for the hollywood reporter , baum unravels what he believes is likely the iconic blonde 's true identity , publishing yearbook photos , marriage certificates , and more . the woman who 's adorned hundreds of billboards across la since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym angelyne—she 's been called a precursor to other " famous for being famous " celebrities like paris hilton and kim kardashian—appears to have started off as ronia tamar goldberg . she came to california in 1959 by way of israel , and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when goldberg , who upon arrival to la became renee , was just 14 . baum reached out to goldberg 's alleged younger sister , now annette block , and her husband , as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister , all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all . angelyne , for her part , has gone on airtalk with host larry mantle to claim that the story contains " a lot of inaccuracies " and that the " vindictive " piece can never change the fact that she is " not a woman " but " an icon . " indeed , she ran for mayor of hollywood in 2008 , per the washington post , and came in 28th out of 135 candidates ; she also ran for governor of california in 2003 and , of course , has made numerous paid appearances at events and is the subject of a documentary . for now , the legend and sometimes-actress/singer who says she was orphaned at a young age and whose hollywood start traces back to a 1974 porno tells baum she wants to save her story for a memoir for " my own financial interest . " ( the kardashians have erected an elaborate and bizarre business empire . )
