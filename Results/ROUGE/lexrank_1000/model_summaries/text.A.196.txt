a judge in florida has allowed a vegan mom who defied a doctor 's orders to regain custody of her infant son , reports wftv . the strange case began in june when police in casselberry charged sarah markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old caleb . the charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed caleb as dehydrated and underweight , and told markham to take him to the hospital immediately , recounts wkmg . instead , markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk . when she did n't show up at the hospital , police came to her house , and she told them she wanted a second doctor 's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products . today , a seminole county judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist 's report in 10 days . " there 's no case , there 's no abuse , there 's no neglect—there 's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother , and he did n't like it , " says caleb 's grandfather , bo markham . the child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother 's care , and now weighs about 17 pounds . " he 's still on a soy formula , " says bo markham . the criminal neglect charges are still pending , though sarah markham 's attorney—mark o'mara , who defended george zimmerman—says he expects they will be dismissed now .
