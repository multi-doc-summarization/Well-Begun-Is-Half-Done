the washington post 's decision to run an op-ed piece by sarah palin on the " climategate " emails is attracting almost as much derision as palin 's call for president obama to boycott the copenhagen conference , the huffington post notes . here 's an attitude roundup : palin was " looking for a way to inject herself into this and found it , " writes marc ambinder , who dissects the piece paragraph by paragraph in a highly critical " annotated " version at the atlantic . scientific consensus on climate change now appears to represent " the radical environmental movement " to palin , writes mark silva at the chicago tribune , noting that she was singing a different tune on the campaign trail last year . " what use is the washington post ? " asks tim lambert at science blogs , complaining that even the links embedded in palin 's piece contradict her claim that there is no consensus on global warming . " if they are not going to do even the most perfunctory fact checking on the stuff they publish , what value do they add ? "
