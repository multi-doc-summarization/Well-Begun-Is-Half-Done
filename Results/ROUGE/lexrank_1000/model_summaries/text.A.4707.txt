the philadelphia couple who raised more than $ 400,000 for a homeless veteran are using the fund as their " personal piggy bank , " lawyers for johnny bobbitt jr. write in a lawsuit filed tuesday . though lawyers say bobbitt is staying at a hotel during a third stint in rehab , the 35-year-old marine corps veteran had been back to panhandling and battling a drug addiction on philadelphia 's streets despite a generous gofundme campaign organized by kate mcclure , 28 , and mark d'amico , 39 . they started the campaign after bobbitt used his last $ 20 to buy gas for a stranded mcclure and later bought a camper in which bobbitt resided on property owned by mcclure 's family . asked to leave in june because of drug use , per the philadelphia inquirer , bobbitt alleges he 's received just $ 75,000 of what he 's due . mcclure and d'amico have interfered , spending more than half of the $ 402,000 raised " to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford , " the lawsuit claims , per abc news . bobbitt previously wondered at how mcclure , a receptionist , could afford a new bmw . but the couple have said only $ 500 of the fund was improperly spent on gambling and repaid . noting well over $ 150,000 remains but is being withheld from bobbitt for fear he will spend it on drugs , the couple say they 'll open the fund to review by an accountant , per the inquirer . too late , according to bobbitt 's lawyers , who say the lawsuit seeking a court-appointed overseer of the account came after d'amico ignored repeated requests for a full accounting . " he 's really left us with no choice but to go forward , " one tells the ap . a thursday hearing is set .
