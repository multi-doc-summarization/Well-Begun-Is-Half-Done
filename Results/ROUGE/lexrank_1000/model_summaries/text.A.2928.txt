the winter solstice officially occurred at 6:04pm est yesterday , marking the first day of winter and the longest night of the year . but all " longest nights " are n't created equal , and the longest night in earth 's history likely happened in 1912 . here 's why : the earth 's rotation has been slowing a little bit every year since the planet formed some 4.5 billion years ago , and we have a phenomenon known as tidal acceleration to thank . the moon 's gravity pulls on our oceans , tugging the oceans that face it into a " bulge " ( livescience digs into why there 's a bulge on the other side , too ) . but as the earth rotates , that tidal bulge is pushed to a position just ahead of the point of our planet that 's directly below the moon . that causes the earth to experience " just a bit of friction from this bulge of water as it rotates , slowing it down slightly , " explains vox . and as a nasa article explains , as earth slows , the moon is able to inch away from us . the effects of these things are so tiny it takes atomic clocks to spot them , but they 're very gradually making our nights longer—mostly . in the long view , we 're slowing , but geological factors ( like ice melting at our poles , for instance ) can impact the rotational speed , and as this university of california observatories graph shows , the length of our day has gone infinitesimally up and down over the last century , but the peak—and therefore the longest night in our history—occurred in 1912 . as far as the length of last night goes , it depends on where you spent it , notes the washington post . washington , dc , saw about 9.5 hours of daylight yesterday , while miami got almost 10.5 , and fairbanks , alaska , saw less than four . ( the 2010 winter solstice was remarkable for quite another reason . )
