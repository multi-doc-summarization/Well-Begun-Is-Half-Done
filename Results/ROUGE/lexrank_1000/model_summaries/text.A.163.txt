the main obstacle keeping marco rubio from seeking re-election to his senate seat just disappeared . the prospect of rubio doing so gained traction in the wake of the orlando shooting , but he continued to insist that he would n't run against his friend already in the race , carlos lopez-cantera . now , however , lopez-cantera himself is publicly giving rubio the all-clear , reports politico . he says he and rubio discussed it in recent days , with lopez-cantera encouraging him to consider changing his mind . “ i don ’ t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure , ” he quotes rubio as responding . the incumbent told reporters on wednesday that he 'd go home this week to spend time with his family and consider his next steps . rumors are swirling that the pair have some sort of plan—perhaps for rubio to win the seat over a democrat ( republicans believe he has the best shot ) , then resign and allow lopez-cantera to run before the 2020 presidential campaign . but lopez-cantera says that 's not the case . " until i mentioned this , he was really committed to spending time with his kids , being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere , " he says . as of now , " nothing has changed , ” he adds . " i 'm still running . marco is n't . " rubio 's decision isn ’ t expected until the weekend at the earliest , per the wall street journal ; he has until june 24 to file for re-election . if he does so , lopez-cantera wo n't run , says politico .
