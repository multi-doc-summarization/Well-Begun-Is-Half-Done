entertainers , journalists , and politicians have lost their careers over sexual misconduct in the age of # metoo , but it seems doctors have little to worry about . according to an ap investigation , many doctors facing sexual assault charges will keep their medical license and simply go on suspension while taking a kind of addiction-treatment therapy . most undergo no medical-license review and need only avoid trouble for a five-year period . in one case , florida doctor gunwant dhaliwal was convicted by a jury of misdemeanor battery for grabbing a patient 's breasts but still works in the tampa area . " there 's been a failure of the medical community to take a stand against the issue , " says a health services researcher . many factors weigh in doctors ' favor , like hospital staffs and patients who are reluctant to accuse them , the atlanta journal-constitution reported in a 2016 probe . not to mention that state medical boards are often full of doctors : " they work very hard to get their medical degrees and they 're very , very disinclined to yank the license of another doctor , " says a medical malpractice lawyer . " the primary focus is : let 's take care of the doctor and help him get through this problem . " but the rehabilitation programs do n't always work , and either way , doctors who commit a crime are getting away with it . " i had to sit there in front of him , look him in the eye , they made their guilty verdict and that 's it , nothing came of it , " says the woman groped by dhaliwal . " he should have lost his license a long time ago . "
