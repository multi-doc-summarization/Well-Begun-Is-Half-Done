what 's a fitting way to execute a man labeled " worse than a dog " ? if an unconfirmed newspaper report is to be believed , by stripping him naked , throwing him in a cage , and feeding him alive to 120 hungry hounds . nbc news picks up hong kong-based paper wen wei po 's account of how kim jong un did away with his uncle , jang song thaek , last month . its report claims jang and his five closest aides were set upon by a pack of hunting dogs that had n't eaten in days as kim and his brother , flanked by 300 officials , watched ; the report has n't been verified . wen wei po , which has close ties to china 's communist party , added jang and his allies were " completely eaten up " in the " quan jue , " or execution by dogs—a break from the usual execution by firing squad—over the course of an hour , the straits times notes . though kim has championed the execution , there 's been no official word from pyongyang on how it was carried out . the times sees the publication of the account as an indication that beijing is none too pleased with north korea in the wake of the execution and " no longer cares about its relations with the kim regime . " this follows a previous report that claimed that two of jang 's top men who were killed prior to his own death were executed using antiaircraft machine guns .
