barack obama ’ s approval rating took a pretty significant jump overnight after the killing of osama bin laden , with 56 % now saying they approve of the job he ’ s doing overall , according to a washington post-abc news poll conducted last night . that ’ s a 9-point increase from obama ’ s april rating . he also notched a career high 69 % approval rating for his handling of terrorism , and a 60 % approval rating for his work in afghanistan . obama ’ s boost is nearly identical to the one bush got after saddam hussein ’ s capture in 2003 . in both cases , independents moved the most , improving their view of each president by 10 percentage points . but it wasn ’ t all good news for the white house : the public is as skeptical as ever of obama ’ s handling of the economy , with an unchanged 40 % approving . that could make sustaining the osama boost a challenge . ( meanwhile , a daily beast/newsweek poll finds little change in his overall approval rating before and after the raid . )
