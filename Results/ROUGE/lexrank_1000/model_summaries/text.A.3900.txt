it 's another win for cord-cutters , but in this case they 'll still need some ties to apple or cablevision . customers of either company now have access to hbo now , a stand-alone streaming service that offers hbo content for $ 15 a month , reports the wall street journal . those who sign up in april can try it out for free the first month . ( everyone 's pointing out that hbo made the service available ahead of sunday 's premiere of the new game of thrones season . ) apple customers can get hbo now though an app on the iphone , ipad , or ipod , or via apple tv . subscribers to cablevision 's optimum online also can get it via an app . some quick reaction : " it 's hbo go without the costly cable package , " writes chris welch at the verge . " if you do n't have any apple devices around , jumping in right now might not make the most sense . cord cutting android users will need to keep borrowing someone else 's hbo go login for now . " " obviously the app will be coming to other places eventually ( one can only assume android , xbox , and nearly every set-top box , much like hbo go ) , but for now it â€™ s ios , cablevision or nothing , " writes eric limer at gizmodo . " but even with those artificial and temporary constraints , the days of hbo without the cable are finally here . "
