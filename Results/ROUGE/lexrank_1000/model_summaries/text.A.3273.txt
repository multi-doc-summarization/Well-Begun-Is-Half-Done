an 8-year-old boy in canada never had any problems eating salmon or peanuts . then , within just a few weeks of getting a blood transfusion as part of his treatment for brain cancer , he ate salmon and experienced a severe allergic reaction within 10 minutes . the same thing happened when he ate a chocolate peanut butter cup four days later . doctors determined he was suffering from transfusion-borne allergies , and wrote about it in the canadian medical association journal . a piece in scientific american calls the case " extremely rare . " but with allergies so common , why is that , well , the case ? such a reaction can only occur if three factors are in place , explains scientific american . the donor must first have high levels of the type of immunoglobulin-e ( ige ) antibodies that set off allergic reactions . the patient must then receive a significant amount of that blood and , within a few months , be exposed to the allergen the ige antibodies would react to . that 's because—in good news for this 8-year-old and others like him—the ige antibodies eventually disappear from the blood because the recipients do n't produce the same antibodies on their own . in this case , the boy was again eating fish and peanut butter six months later . scientific american points out that antibody-transfer is usually a good thing , as it helps guard against infection . and avoiding a situation like this is tough , livescience reports . having allergies does n't disqualify would-be donors ( in either the us or canada ) , and having a high level of ige in the blood does n't always correlate with experiencing allergies . ( last year , a toddler almost died from a nearly unheard-of allergy . )
