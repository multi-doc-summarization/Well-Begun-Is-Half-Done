the dalai lama says it ’ s up to him to decide whether he should be reincarnated—and of course china is n't having any of that . beijing today dismissed any successor picked by the spiritual leader himself as illegal , following the 76-year-old ’ s statement this weekend that he ’ ll make a decision on reincarnation when he ’ s “ about 90 . " he said china shouldn ’ t weigh in on the choice ; china , however , says that “ the title of dalai lama is conferred by the central government and is illegal otherwise . " traditionally , monks pick a young boy to be dalai lama based on signs he is the previous leader ’ s reincarnation , afp notes . but “ a dalai lama identifying his own successor has never been the practice , ” says a rep for china ’ s foreign ministry . “ the reincarnation of the dalai lama should follow religious rituals and historical conventions and laws and regulations of this state . " the current dalai lama said he planned to offer “ clear guidelines to recognize the next dalai lama ” while he remains “ physically and mentally fit. ” meanwhile , two young tibetan monks set themselves on fire today in china , calling for religious freedom .
