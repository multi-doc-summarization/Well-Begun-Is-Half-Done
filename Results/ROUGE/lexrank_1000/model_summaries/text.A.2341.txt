if your chosen candidate does n't win on nov. 8 , there 's perhaps no need to decamp to canada or russia : become a citizen of asgardia instead . that 's the name of the newly proposed " first nation state in space . " named after a world in norse mythology that 's located in the sky , the would-be extraterrestrial state stems from a project led by russian scientist igor ashurbeyli , who heads unesco 's science of space committee , reports the telegraph . there 's no terra firma for asgardian citizens to travel to : the guardian reports asgardia appears to " consist of a single satellite , " planned to be launched by the project next year . ashurbeyli explains " physically the citizens of that nation state will be on earth , " meaning they 'll be a citizen of their own country and asgardia simultaneously . cnet frames asgardia as a " scientific , legal , and technological experiment , " with ashurbeyli planning to petition the un for the status of state once 100,000 people have applied to be citizens on the asgardia website , which launched wednesday . among the project 's ambitious goals : to create a state-of-the-art protective shield to keep space debris and asteroids from reaching earth 's surface . space regulation is another focus : since the late 1960s , the outer space treaty has assigned liability for objects sent into space on the nation launching them . asgardia could in theory " do an end-run around government regulations that are a key part of making the treaty work by forming a new government accountable to nobody but the space enthusiasts that formed it , " observes cnet . ( see what nasa did in space earlier this year . )
