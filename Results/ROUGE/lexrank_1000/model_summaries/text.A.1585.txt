the rachel dolezal story got even stranger during an nbc interview last night in which , as raw story puts it , she went " full-scale birther " on herself . asked by savannah guthrie whether she thought it was misleading to identify as black , dolezal responded , " i have n't had a dna test . there 's been no biological proof that larry and ruthanne [ dolezal ] are my biological parents . " when reminded that her name and their names are on her birth certificate , dolezal said she could n't prove they 're not her parents , but " i do n't know that i can actually prove they are . i mean , the birth certificate is issued a month and a half after i 'm born . and certainly there were no medical witnesses to my birth . " " i definitely am not white , " dolezal continued . " nothing about being white describes who i am . the closest thing that i can come to is ifâ€”if you 're black or white , i 'm black . i 'm more black than i am white . " dolezal said she has n't changed her skin color , but she does spray on bronzer some days . it is n't clear whether there were any " medical witnesses " to her birth , or whether she really believes her parents may not be her parents . dolezal has claimed to have been born in a tepee , but her uncle tells the new york times that is n't true . " larry and ruthanne were kind of the quintessential jesus people , hippies , back to nature , and they set up a tepee and lived in it for a year , " he says . " drove my parents crazy , but nobody was born in the tepee . "
