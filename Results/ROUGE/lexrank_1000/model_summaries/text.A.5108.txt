us employers pulled back on hiring in april after a streak of solid monthly gains , adding 160,000 jobs , the fewest in seven months , the ap reports . the unemployment rate remained at a low of 5 % , roughly the same level it has been since the fall . the job gain was down from the average increase of 200,000 over the past three months , which is the softest three-month pace since october . the slowdown may raise concerns that weak us economic growth has discouraged some employers from hiring . the economy 's growth has slumped to a sluggish 1 % annual rate since october . meanwhile , the labor participation rate went down to 62.8 % , per money . but there was good news on the wage gains front : average hourly pay rose 2.5 % from a year earlier—a " hot number , " the wall street journal notes , and above the sluggish 2 % pace that has been typical for the past six years . money reports that consumer confidence in the jobs that are out there is rising , with more people perceiving that jobs are " plentiful " rather than " hard to get " for the first time since the great recession ended . the journal notes that april 's jobs report will only serve to keep the fed in " standby mode " as it ponders whether to boost the short-term interest rate . officials had suggested that such a rate increase in june may have been in the cards if the economy picked up steam—but now it will likely take better news on consumption , hiring , and inflation for the rate increase to happen .
