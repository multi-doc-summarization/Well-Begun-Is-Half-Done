the swelling tide of well wishes for the cosby show actor who was job-shamed by multiple media outlets may have just turned into something more lucrative . sources tell tmz that geoffrey owens has accepted a job offer by filmmaker and producer tyler perry , who tweeted earlier this week that the 57-year-old actor should " join us " on own 's the haves and the have nots , which perry writes for and directs . tmz reports that owens is said to be slotted into a recurring role and will appear on 10 episodes , and that he 's set to fly to atlanta next week to begin filming . owens had previously spoken on perry 's offer , though he simply called it a " generous " one and did n't indicate whether he 'd take it , per people . in fact , owens tells the hollywood reporter he 's considering " a whole handful " of tv offers . " it 's been a real generosity of spirit and a generosity of action , " he says . owens , who has since spoken on the " honor of the working person and the dignity of work , " says his first concern when the photo of him broke was his 19-year-old son , people notes . he says he texted his son , who 's away at school , to warn him and to apologize for the embarrassmentâ€”but his son texted right back to say how proud he was of owens . " i cried , i just broke down , " owens says . " it was beautiful . " one other person is stepping up to do right by owens : nicki minaj , who told entertainment tonight she wants to donate $ 25,000 to the actor . " some people are on the internet and seeking attention , and he 's just the antithesis of that , " she says . she notes she 's having her rep reach out to owens ' people so he " does n't take it the wrong way . " ( the woman who took the owens photo is now speaking . )
