there 's a rumble brewing in the wilds of montana , but the unlikely parties involved are n't slinging guns so much as heading for court . the gardiner water and sewer treatment district is suing none other than the national park service , reports courthouse news service , and it 's over less-than-pristine water coming from yellowstone national park—specifically , water it 's being forced to treat that contains high levels of arsenic . the district says that dealing with its sludge ponds will cost an estimated $ 2 million . per the lawsuit : an " engineer recommended that the district address this infiltration problem with the park prior to beginning any sludge removal project . " otherwise , the problem would simply return again . but as the district " can not await the park service ’ s responses any longer , it has been compelled to file suit . " yellowstone is estimated to be contributing 95 % of the arsenic present ; the engineer does n't think the arsenic is coming from wastewater , but possibly from leaky pipes or manholes within the park , reports the bozeman daily chronicle . arsenic can occur naturally in geothermal areas , and it 's not uncommon in montana , notes cns . the district—which first wrote the park service in march 2015 , then again in december 2015 , to no response—wants a court injunction to force yellowstone to clean up its act , to compensate the district , and to monitor its sewer lines ; it 's also requesting a jury trial . a yellowstone rep said only that interior department lawyers are " looking into it . " ( meanwhile , one of our largest water sources is contaminated . )
