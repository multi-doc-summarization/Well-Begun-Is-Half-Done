the new release flight , starring denzel washington as drug- and alcohol-addicted pilot , gets a solid 78 % on rotten tomatoes . most critics seem to think the acting and directing are superb , but at some point , the movie takes a bit of a nosedive : flight starts out with a thrilling plane crash , and after that " takes a surprising turn into a drama of addiction and moral exploration , " writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal . unfortunately , the latter parts feel " shopworn " and " instead of hurtling to a climax , the story moves in fits and starts , loses momentum . " rick groen at the globe and mail praises director robert zemeckis ' ability to deliver a good crash scene , but thinks his sentimentality hurts the movie . " this movie is captivating until it gets uplifting—flight soars when it crashes and crashes when it soars , " he writes . good music , strong supporting actors , and great special effects are flight 's strong suits , but the " downward addiction and denial spiral " is all too familiar , writes tom long for the detroit news . " it 's that movie , done well , but done again . " peter travers , writing for rolling stone , disagrees . he says those complaining are " missing the point of an exceptional entertainment that zemeckis shades into something quietly devastating—not an addiction drama , but the deeper spectacle of a man facing the truth about himself .
