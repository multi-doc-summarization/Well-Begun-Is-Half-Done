as many fret over the increasingly tense relationship between the us and north korea , president trump threw another country into the mix friday : venezuela . speaking to reporters friday from his new jersey golf club , flanked by secretary of state rex tillerson , us ambassador to the un nikki haley , and national security adviser hr mcmaster , trump offered what reuters calls a " surprise escalation " on the us response to venezuela 's current political upheaval , in which more than 120 people have been killed and thousands arrested over the past four months . " venezuela is not very far away , and the people are suffering and they are dying , " trump told reporters , per the hill . " we have many options for venezuela , including a possible military option if necessary . " when pressed by reporters on whether that meant the us would lead an operation in the south american country , trump replied , " we do n't talk about it , but a military operation—a military option—is certainly something that we could pursue . " the us just hit venezuelan president nicolas maduro with financial sanctions in late july , with a statement from trump noting : " maduro is not just a bad leader . he is now a dictator . " the pentagon told reuters it has yet to receive any instructions from the president regarding venezuela . meanwhile , one reporter circled back to north korea during trump 's appearance , asking , " is the us going to go to war ? " after trump mentioned a possible " bad solution " to the korea problem , per cbs news . " i think you know the answer to that , " the president replied .
