the first national convention by the organizers of the dc women 's march will be held in detroit starting oct. 27 , but there 's already a bit of turmoil over one of the scheduled speakers . the washington post reports that bernie sanders is set to make remarks on opening day of the three-day women 's convention , with the vermont senator writing on facebook he 's " honored to join the women at the front lines of our struggle for economic , social , racial , and environmental justice . " but some think that , at a convention dedicated to women 's issues and rights , those front lines should be reserved for women only ( at least when it comes to prime podium time ) , and they 're grumbling about a selection they do n't think should have been made in the first place . " this choice sends the wrong message , " tweeted the head of the emily 's list pac , one of the convention 's sponsors . there 's even a change.org petition seeking to remove sanders as an opening-day speaker , while still acknowledging he 's been a " [ long-time ] champion for progressive values " for which women are " grateful . " but tamika d. mallory , one of the event 's organizers , points out on twitter that sanders—just one of two men among the 60-plus scheduled speakers—is n't the day 's headliner ( rep. maxine waters is ) , and she points out to the detroit free press that sanders is an expert activist mobilizer . as for why someone like elizabeth warren , kamala harris , or even hillary clinton was n't helping to lead opening-day honors , mallory adds in a statement that " many elected officials " were invited , but that their schedules did n't permit them to attend , per cnn .
