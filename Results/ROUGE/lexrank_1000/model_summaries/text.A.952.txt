facebook has begun rolling out an important new protection , and gawker 's ryan tate says users should " jump on this " as soon they can . it 's an encryption tool called facebook https that will " keep any random jerk in the café from hijacking your account . " unfortunately , users have to opt-in to the service , at least for now , and tate offers a walk-through of how to do it under account settings . ( facebook does , too , in its blog post . ) you may not be able to make the switch immediately , but keep checking back . " switching to https is important because a browser extension called firesheep has made it especially easy for anyone sharing your open wireless network—at cafe or conference , for example—to sniff your credentials and freely access your account , " writes tate . also note that this protection does n't apply to the facebook iphone app .
