police have uncovered one big clue but no answers in the search for a 31-year-old virginia woman who was last heard from on wednesday . nicole mittendorff 's 2009 mini cooper was found saturday night in what the washington post describes as a " remote area " of the shenandoah national park ; it was left near the whiteoak canyon trail , which is close to old rag , described by the national park service as shenandoah 's " most popular and most dangerous hike . " some of mittendorff 's family suggested it 's possible she was headed to the area to do a trail run , something she reportedly regularly did . fox 5 dc reports authorities have said that nothing yet indicates something " suspicious in nature " occurred . wusa9 describes mittendorff as " extremely dedicated " to her job as a firefighter ; her father says she did n't show up for a changeover on friday morning , and she was reported missing that day . a " find nicole " website and facebook page have been set up . the latter features a saturday night post from mittendorff 's husband , steven , who " continues to ask for your prayers for both our family and the many who continue to investigate . " as for the search , another post on the page notes the virginia state police " do not need volunteers and they 've asked to keep away anyone outside the official effort . that will keep any changes , traces or other items undisturbed and prevent distractions .
