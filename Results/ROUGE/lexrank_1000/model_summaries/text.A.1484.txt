with the death toll now at 282 and the hope of finding survivors diminishing , anger over yesterday 's mine disaster in turkey is spiking fastâ€”and some are n't hesitating to point fingers . " what happened in soma is not fate , it is murder , " a branch of the chamber of electrical engineers wrote yesterday , claiming the cause of the fire was negligence , not " an electrical situation as presented to the public . " the group said , per cnn , " the investigation revealed that the systems to sense poisonous and explosive gases in the mine and the systems to manage the air systems were insufficient and old " and air fans actually pushed flames farther through the mine ; ventilation was n't righted until " much later . " a video , obtained by the telegraph , is n't helping the government 's standing after news that an opposition motion to inspect the mines was shot down last month . it appears to show an aide to pm recep tayyip erdogan kicking a grieving protester , held down by paramilitary police in soma , where protesters have vandalized a local ruling party office . erdogan has said the opposition motion had " nothing to do with the soma mine . " already turkey 's worst ever industrial accident , the death toll could reach 400 as 150 miners are still underground and no survivors have been found since yesterday morning , the guardian notes . cnn adds the bodies of 200 miners have been returned to their families , while the ap reports on the songs of heartbreak being sung as backhoes dig rows of graves and funerals begin en masse .
