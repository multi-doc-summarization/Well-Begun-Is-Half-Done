tomatoes and potatoes go together like , well , ketchup and fries—so why not grow them together ? a hybrid plant known as the " tomtato " or , yes , " ketchup ' n ' fries , " allows you to do just that , and it 's now available in the us after first being released in the uk . the plant combines a vine growing cherry tomatoes with roots growing white potatoes—but it 's not genetically engineered . rather , it 's created by grafting , in which the tomatoes are " spliced onto potato rootstock , " the oregonian explains , noting the process works well for tomatoes and potatoes because they are closely related . technically , you could try to do it at home , but it requires the plant stems you 're joining be the same thickness . supernaturals grafted vegetables is the company handling the grafting process in the us , and home gardeners can purchase the non-gmo plant in a 2.5-inch pot from the territorial seed company . " people have been grafting tomatoes and potatoes for a while , but mostly as a novelty , " territorial 's marketing director tells opb , noting that before this plant was commercialized , it was necessary to research varieties to find ones that " complement each other well . " now , purchasers can expect to harvest some 500 red cherry tomatoes and 4.5 pounds of potatoes from each plant . back in 2013 when the plant was only available in the uk , stephen colbert featured it on his " the craziest f # ? ing thing i 've ever heard " segment , calling it " unnatural " and noting , " the only time tomatoes and potatoes should meet is at the bottom of a styrofoam clamshell .
