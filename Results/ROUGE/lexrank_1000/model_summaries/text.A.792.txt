one person is dead and five are injured after ice caves on washington state 's big four mountain collapsed yesterday for the second day in a row . a hiker 's body has yet to be recovered from the caves—formed in snow mounds that end up sliding down to the base of a cliff—because of the " fragile nature of the ice , " a snohomish county rep says . two men , 25 and 35 , and a woman , 35 , were airlifted to a hospital with serious injuries , including leg and pelvis fractures , reports nbc news . a boy and girl were also admitted with minor injuries but have since been released , reports the seattle times . " there was a loud pop above us , " chloe jakubowski says . " once i saw the ice chunks falling , i ducked for cover and held my hands over my head . " she says a woman standing next to her was knocked unconscious by falling ice . " as soon as it stopped , i looked ... around me and it was extremely gruesome , honestly , " says jakubowski , 18 . she did n't have cell service and had to drive 15 miles to a campsite to call for help . rescuers say the call came in about 45 minutes after the collapse . " there was a large pile of ice and rock that came down , " says the county rep. " in many ways , it was similar to an avalanche . " a day earlier , a visitor to the caves , popular among hikers and only accessible by a narrow , 26-mile road , captured a partial collapse on video , but no one was injured in that case . authorities have long considered the caves to be dangerous , particularly in warm weather—temps hit 80 degrees in the area yesterday—and signs warn of the risky conditions . they were installed after the last death at the caves , that of an 11-year-old girl hit by falling ice in 2010 .
