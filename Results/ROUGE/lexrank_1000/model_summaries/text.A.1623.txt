obamacare is still going into effect in 2014 , but one key component of it is being temporarily shelved . the white house today postponed by one year a rule requiring employers to either provide coverage to employees or face hefty fines , reports the wall street journal . the rule will take effect in 2015 , instead of 2014 . " we have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively , " writes treasury official mark mazur in a blog post . the journal explains that while most employers already provide such coverage , restaurants and retail companies in particular—both of which rely on low-wage workers—were resisting . the rule affects businesses with more than 50 workers . the hill calls the decision " stunning " and says it " represents an enormous victory for businesses that had lobbied against the healthcare law . " it also notes that the move pushes back the start of the controversial provision until after the 2014 midterms , which should be good news for vulnerable democrats . the new york times reports that other key parts of obamacare , including the establishment of " exchanges " where people can buy insurance , will take effect as planned in 2014 . but " it will be difficult for officials running the exchanges to know who is entitled to subsidies if they are not able to confirm whether employers are offering insurance to their employees , " writes jackie calmes .
