a canada college student who met a woman at a bar but somehow screwed up taking down her phone number still managed to connect using a nuclear option . carlos zetina , a first year student at university of calgary , knew the woman he 'd met was also a student . he also knew her first name : nicole . armed with these modest facts , zetina soberly made his way to the school directory , searched for the name nicole , then proceeded to email all 246 coeds who share the name , the calgary herald reports . “ if you ( sic ) name is nicole and you ’ re from holland and you think nietzsche is depressing then text me , ” zetina wrote in the email , which was obtained by the star . “ i ’ m carlos btw i ’ m the guy who took you and your friend home last night ... if you are the one and just don ’ t want to talk to me that ’ s ok as well. ” many of the nicoles ( and variations zetina looped in , including nicolettes and nikkis ) who received the email friday were so taken aback by zetina 's gesture that they could n't help but poke fun at him to one another . nicole dugraye even started a facebook group for all the women called " nicole from last night , " thereby turning zetina 's email into a way to make new friends . ironically , the intended recipient nicole reportedly did n't receive the email and only learned of it through social media . lucky for zetina , she was n't pulling a fast one with a fake phone number and believes he just got a digit wrong . she not only wants to meet up with zetina , but intends to hang out with all her fellow nicoles , too .
