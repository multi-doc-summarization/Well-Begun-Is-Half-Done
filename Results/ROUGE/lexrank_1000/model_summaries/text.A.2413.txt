julie marburger had had itâ€”and then she reached a new level of fed-up . the 45-year-old texas middle school teacher has decided to give up teaching at the end of the school year , but in a march 28 facebook post , she writes that she did n't know if she would " make it even that long . " she explains she had to leave work early that day " after an incident with a parent left me unable emotionally to continue . " and it was n't an anomaly . " parents have become far too disrespectful , " their kids are worse , and administrators just want to keep parents happy . yet marburger , who teaches in cedar creek , anticipated dealing with more super unhappy parents soon . reports cards were being issued later in the week , and almost half her students are failing because of missing assignments . she called and emailed parents to try to turn things around , to no avail . " now i 'm probably going to spend my entire week next week fielding calls and emails from irate parents , wanting to know why i failed their kid . " the root of the issue is that parents are " coddling and enabling their children , " and it has to stop . ditto the disrespect . " most parents ca n't stand to spend more than a couple hours a day with their kid , but we spend 8 with yours and 140 others just like him . is it too much to ask for a little common courtesy and civil conversation ? " her post has been shared more than 420,000 times , and she tells good morning america she was worried people might take offense . instead , she 's found " more support , " as says she 's exploring her options in terms of her teaching future . ( this teacher 's post about a broken chair also got a big reaction . )
