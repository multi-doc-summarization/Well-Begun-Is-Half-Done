did a brain-damaged american help turn the boston bombing suspects against the us ? the far-right and conspiracy theorist publications found in tamerlan tsarnaev 's apartment appear to have been supplied by an elderly man befriended by the brothers through their mother 's job as a home health aide , the wall street journal finds . a lawyer for the family of donald larking , a 67-year-old who suffered brain damage when he was shot in a robbery 40 years ago , says larking was obsessed with conspiracy theories and shared publications with the brothers that questioned the holocaust and accused the us or israeli governments of being behind 9/11 and the newtown school shooting . larking also supplied the brothers with copies of a white supremacist newspaper published in alabama . he became so close to tamerlan that he converted to islam and began attending the local mosque with him , says the lawyer , who stresses that the shooting badly impaired the elderly man 's " awareness of the realities of the world " and his ability to make decisions , the ap reports . larking , who still attends the mosque , has sunk into " depression and anger " since the boston marathon bombing and believes his friends were the victims of another conspiracy , the lawyer says .
