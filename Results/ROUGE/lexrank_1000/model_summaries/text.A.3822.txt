the chilean flag is annoyingly similar to texas ' state flag , but that does n't mean lone star staters should appropriate chile 's flag emoji when they feel like expressing texas pride . that 's the gist of what one state lawmaker is trying to push through via texas house concurrent resolution 75 , which takes it upon itself to " urge " residents not to use the chilean icon online as a substitute for the non-existent texas flag emoji , the houston chronicle reports . in what the dallas morning news says belongs under the " yes , it 's a real bill " umbrella , cypress ' conservative rep. tom oliverson filed the resolution , noting , " just as our flag could never fully embody the country of chile , neither can the chilean flag inspire feelings of pride and passion in the heart of a true texan . " he points out that although both flags feature a similar red , white , and blue layout capped by that lone star , which often causes emoji-users to confuse chile 's flag for texas ' flag , chile 's colors are meant to symbolize " sky , snow , and blood spilled while fighting for freedom , " while texas ' hues are meant to represent " loyalty , purity , and bravery . " he also notes that the blue in his state 's flag extends all the way down to the bottom , while chile 's is cut off into a square about halfway down ( he even wants to get the # thebluegoesallthewaydown hashtag to pick up steam ) . that said , oliverson concedes this bill is n't " the most pressing issue " the legislature has on its plate at the moment , per the morning news . ( the white house rejected a texas secession petition a few years back . )
