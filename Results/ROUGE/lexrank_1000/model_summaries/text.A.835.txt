port authority police officer jesse turano was patrolling the george washington bridge tuesday night when he got a call about a man who had entered a closed walkway , even after a security guard ordered him not to . when he got there , turano " could just tell by his mannerisms " that the man " was possibly emotionally disturbed , " he tells the star-ledger . when the man put his hands on the outer railing and braced himself to kick off , turano sprang into action . " officer turano grabbed him around the waist while the man was airborne [ and ] pulled him back onto the walkway , " a port authority rep tells nj.com . all of which might be amazing for some people , but not for turanoâ€”it was the fifth time this year he has stopped a would-be jumper , says the rep. turano shrugs off any suggestion that he is , in the star-ledger 's words , a " superhero . " " i guess it 's always good if you save somebody 's life , " he says . " but i do n't really think about it too much . " the jumper , at least , seemed appreciative . " he kept thanking me and i said the best thanks you can give me is if you get yourself some help . " the new york post reports that 2012 saw a record number of suicides on the bridge : 18 , as well as 43 attempts .
