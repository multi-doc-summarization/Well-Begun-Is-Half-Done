" iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , challenged trump over the withdrawal wednesday , saying " you can not do a damn thing , " cnbc reports . but while hardliners are calling for the country to immediately restart its nuclear program , iranian president hassan rouhani says the deal can still be salvaged . he announced late tuesday that he will send his foreign minister to visit the other signatories : china , france , germany , russia , and the uk . jean-yves le drian , france 's foreign minister , said wednesday that " the deal is not dead , " the bbc reports . " there 's an american withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there , " he said . russian officials said they were " deeply disappointed " by trump 's decision , though it was cheered by tehran foes israel and saudi arabia .
