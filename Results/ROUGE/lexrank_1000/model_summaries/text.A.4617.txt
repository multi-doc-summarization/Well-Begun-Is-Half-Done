london 's transport authority says it wo n't renew uber 's license to operate in the british capital , arguing that it demonstrates a lack of corporate responsibility with implications in public safety and security . transport for london says the car-hailing app was not " fit and proper to hold a private hire operator license . " it cited uber 's approach to reporting serious criminal offenses and its " approach to explaining the use of greyball in london " ; that 's the software uber reportedly used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app , preventing " officials from undertaking regulator or law enforcement duties . " the ap reports london mayor sadiq khan said he supported the decision , saying any operator of taxi services in the city " needs to play by the rules . " he says that " providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety and security . " uber 's current license is up on sept. 30 , but the guardian reports it can appeal the decision over the next 21 days . it can keep operating " until any appeal processes have been exhausted , " per transport for london .
