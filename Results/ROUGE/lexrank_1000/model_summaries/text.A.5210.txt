a sweet yearbook-signing photo seems to have won over the internet . it shows students at alan shepard elementary school in bourbonnais , illinois , lining up to have " mr. steve " —aka steve weidner , the school custodian—sign their books . “ he pays attention to the kids , " principal shirley padera tells wgn . “ the kids know if anything happens , mr. steve is going to take care of it. ” the school district first posted the photo on its facebook page , saying mr. steve had attained " rock star status , " and from there it got picked up at reddit . as wilx explains , there was nothing staged about it . weidner , who has been at the school for 15 years , was on the school playground june 2 when students were given some time to sign each other 's books . " so many of the children wanted him to sign their books that someone got him a chair , and a line of children formed to the left , " it adds . no word from weidner himself , but the school says he was touched by the outpouring . ( elsewhere , a teacher was inspired by his students ' anonymous notes . )
