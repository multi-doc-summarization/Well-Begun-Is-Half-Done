scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point : in a new study , a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice , meaning we 're one step closer to a pill that can treat alzheimer 's , the independent reports . neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins , which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off , and symptoms appearing . the compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial " shutdown , " thus basically flipping the switch from " off " back to " on . " proteins are produced , brain cells are protected , and symptoms are reversed . the mice in the study had prion disease , which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder . after receiving the compound , memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed ; the treated mice also lived longer than those who did n't receive the compound , sky news reports . though it 's still a long way off , scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with parkinson 's disease . now the bad news : the mice did suffer side effects , including weight loss and diabetes . ( in other alzheimer 's news , how well you can smell peanut butter could predict your risk of getting the disease . )
