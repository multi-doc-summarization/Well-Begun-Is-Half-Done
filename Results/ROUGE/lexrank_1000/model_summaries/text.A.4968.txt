in a move that is definitely , absolutely , totally not a publicity stunt , australian prime minister julia gillard is knitting a kangaroo for the next heir to the british throne , sky news reports . gillard discussed the " cute project " for the progeny of prince william and kate middleton in the new issue of australian women 's weekly , which came complete with photos showing gillard surrounded by yarn . " in terms of knitting for kate 's babyâ€”i knit for babies , in part , because they are smaller projects , " she explained . despite the fact that gillard 's press office actually pitched the story to the magazine , the office insists it 's not a pr move , but that has n't stopped people from mocking the pm . " i 'm keen to discuss options for an interview/photoshoot with the pm , ideally for the july edition , " reads the email from gillard 's director of communications to the magazine . " as i mentioned the pm is putting together a care package for kate middleton , who is due in mid-july . ... i 'm picturing a story that includes the patterns for the items the pm will knit so your readers can knit their own royal blanket or something . " critics are calling the article " contrived , " among other less-than-nice things , the guardian reports ; the independent calls it " a public relations disaster . " the article conveniently arrives just months before september 's general election , which the controversial pm is predicted to lose . gillard has previously stirred the pot with sandwichgate and her epic takedown of a sexist rival .
