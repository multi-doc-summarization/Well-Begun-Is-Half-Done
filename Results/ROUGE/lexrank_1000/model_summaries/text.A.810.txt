could it be ? a chinese ship searching for flight 370 has picked up a ping in the southern indian ocean , reports cnn and the bbc . both cite a report in china 's xinhua news agency . the pulse is 37.5 khz , the frequency for the malaysian plane 's black-box data recorders , says the president of the beacon 's manufacturer . all the reports caution that it could turn out to be yet another false hope , however . " this could be a variety of things , " says one oceanographer , noting that the frequency is used by lots of instruments . for the record , the chinese ship detected the signal at 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude , says the state-run xinhua . " it is yet to be established whether it is related to the missing jet , " the report says . the development comes as dozens of ships and planes intensify their sweeps in the search zone , given the finite battery life of the data recorders .
