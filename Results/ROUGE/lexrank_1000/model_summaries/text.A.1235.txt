last night , british pm david cameron enjoyed his very first taste of march madness , compliments of president obama . at tonight 's state dinner , he 'll likely enjoy some american wine as well—but do n't expect too many details about the winery , year , or appellation . that 's because obama put a stop to the tradition of revealing said info after his third state dinner ... following a brouhaha over the price tag . in honor of hu jintao 's visit , the chinese president was served a 2005 quilceda creek cabernet sauvignon from washington state that garnered a 100-point robert parker rating . the white house did n't say how much it paid per bottle , but it originally retailed for $ 115 , and was selling for $ 300 and up by the time of the jan. 19 , 2011 , dinner . so when angela merkel was honored at a state dinner in june , the released menu said nothing more than " an american wine will be paired with each course . " ditto for south korean president lee myung-bak 's oct. 13 menu . and while the move may ostensibly make sense ( " they ’ re probably sensitive to displays of wealth at a time when the economy is not firing on all cylinders , " says one wine expert ) , many argue the move hurts , instead of helps . promoting top winemakers " is good for america , " says one wine editor , and bloomberg notes that state dinners provide a prime opportunity to show china and other new big wine importers what the us has to offer . to wit , quilceda creek saw a " pretty significant " uptick in asia after hu 's dinner .
