members of the low-caste dalit community in india were once known as " untouchables . " how times have changed : two just competed against each other for the largely ceremonial office of president , and 71-year-old ram nath kovind came out on top , reports cnn . in india , the real power is with the prime minister . kovind is n't actually the first dalit president , the first coming in 1997 , notes nbc news . in fact , one analyst tells the network that the real significance of the election is n't the caste factor but its reflection of the growing power of the ruling bjp party . both kovind and prime minister narendra modi belong to the bjp ( which is why the election was never really in doubt ) , and modi 's blessing of kovind is seen as a calculated strategy to woo other members of the 200-million-strong dalit community . " dalit politics suddenly has come center stage with a bang , " another analyst tells the new york times . " every leader is bending over backward to show , ' i am a well-wisher . ' " india elects its vice president next month , and bjp is counting on another win to cement its influence over parliament .
