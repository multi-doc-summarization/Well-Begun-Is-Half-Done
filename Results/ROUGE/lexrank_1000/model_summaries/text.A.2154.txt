the destruction of syria 's chemical weapons continues to hit delays—but a secret effort to rid libya of chemical weapons has been a success , the new york times reports . the us and libya have been destroying what was left of moammar gadhafi 's stockpile , including hundreds of weapons containing a mustard agent . the three-month project , which wiped out two tons of arms using what the times calls a " giant , high-tech oven , " ended last week . " it ’ s a big breakthrough , " says an expert , noting that the process—a basis for the much larger effort in syria— " was very difficult because of weather , geography , and because it 's a dangerous area with warring tribes , increasing the risks of theft and diversion . " in 2004 , gadhafi had provided some 24.7 metric tons of chemical weapons to the west for destruction , but only half were gone by the time civil war began in 2011 . the post-gadhafi libyan government sought to rid itself of the remainder , as well as almost two tons of additional material it had found—agents already installed in bombs and artillery , the times notes . the destruction effort , which used funds from the pentagon as well as canada , saw the weapons vaporized in an oven created by swedish firm dynasafe . meanwhile , the bbc is airing old gadhafi secrets in a special tonight ; among them , a former ally who says the strongman ordered a plane shot down near tripoli in 1992 , killing 157 passengers in a demonstration against sanctions .
