it may be a first-world problem—that little drip of wine that slides annoyingly down the neck of a bottle after it 's been poured—but to one scientist , it was simply a physics challenge waiting to be overcome . biophysicist daniel perlman at brandeis university , an inventor with more than 100 patents under his probably well-designed belt , says he 's solved the age-old problem by etching a small groove into the bottle itself , per phys.org . ( you can see a demonstration via this video . ) to arrive at his solution , perlman studied slow-mo videos of wine being poured , then calculated precisely how large of an edge would be required to catch the offending drip . the answer : 2mm wide , 1mm deep . gizmos already are on the market to stop the spills , while sommeliers might use a napkin to deftly wipe the bottle after a pour , but perlman wanted to simplify things . " i wanted to change the wine bottle itself , " thus avoiding the need for an accessory , he says . bloggers sound intrigued . the drip issue is a " pretty obvious " flaw that has been allowed to linger for as long as wine bottles have been made , complains a post at bgr . another at food & wine notes that an industry-wide fix would likely raise manufacturing costs . " but innovation has swept through the beverage industry before—remember when not all cans were wide-mouths ? —so maybe a drip-free future is within our reach . " ( how does neon-blue wine sound ? )
