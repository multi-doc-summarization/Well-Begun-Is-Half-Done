if the new 50 shades of grey trailer was too much for your innocent eyes , studio freestyle releasing has just the flick for you come valentine 's day : old fashioned . in case you could n't guess by the title , the premise of the flick is " chivalry makes a comeback " ( the movie 's tagline ) as a " former frat boy " and a " free-spirited woman " embark on a " faith-based romance , " as variety puts it . so hot , right ? " i wanted to tell a love story that takes the idea of godly romance seriously , " writer , director , and lead actor rik swartzwelder says . " a story that , without apology , explores the possibility of a higher standard in relationships ; yet , is also fully aware of just how fragile we all are and doesn ’ t seek to heap guilt upon those of us that have made mistakes . " or , as jezebel puts it , " they just want to provide a christian alternative to a smutty film about people getting tied up and getting it on . understandable . " in reality , the film 's synopsis , per mtv news , describes a couple attempting " the impossible : an 'old-fashioned ' courtship in contemporary america , " so you 're probably looking at zero sex scenes . freestyle 's co-president explains old fashioned will cater to the " underserved " demographic of christian singles—an audience that helped the studio bring in $ 60 million with god 's not dead earlier this year . despite opening the same weekend as the far-smuttier 50 shades , " we 're hopeful that we are not alone in our belief that there are others out there who desire more from love—and the movies—than objectification or domination , " swartzwelder says .
