how do you get rid of a population of bugs destroying your crops ? scientists are trying out a controversial method : spreading a gene that prevents females from reproducing . males can live with the lab-inserted gene , but females die in the larval stageâ€”which does n't leave a lot of options for reproduction or the future of the species , new scientist reports . in a lab experiment , this decimated the population in 10 weeks . scientists at english firm oxitec want to try their method in spain , where they 're awaiting the ok from spanish authorities to kill off certain fruit flies that destroy some 15 % to 30 % of the olive tree crop each year . but genetic science watchdogs have concerns about the method , fearing , for instance , that altered populations could affect creatures outside their own species , mashable reports . a similar experiment is already happening in the wild in brazil , where the oxitec team has altered males of a population of dengue-carrying mosquitoes . some 96 % of dengue mosquitoes around the city of mandacaru have been destroyed , the company says .
