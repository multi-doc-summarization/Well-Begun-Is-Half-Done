after more than 45 years , time is up for one of japan 's most-wanted criminals . nbc news reports masaaki osaka was arrested wednesday in connection with the 1971 murder of a police officer ; he 's accused of killing officer tsuneo nakamura during a street protest in tokyo in november of that year . a member of the japan revolutionary communist league ( jrcl ) , osaka was protesting the continued american military presence in okinawa , an island 400 miles south of the mainland . authorities say osaka , now 67 , assaulted nakamura with a steel pipe before lighting him on fire with a molotov cocktail . the bbc reports osaka was first arrested last month for allegedly obstructing police during a raid on an apartment in hiroshima . the jrcl was reportedly using it as a hideout , and police were in search of someone other than osaka . although osaka refused to give police his name , he was recognized , and his identity was eventually confirmed through dna testing ; the japan times explains a new warrant on the murder charge was served wednesday . osaka has since been moved from hiroshima to tokyo for further questioning , though the bbc says he has yet to say anything . osaka 's time as a fugitive—aided , authorities say , by the jrcl—was the longest among major-crime suspects being sought by japan 's national police agency .
