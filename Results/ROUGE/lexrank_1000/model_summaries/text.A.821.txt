it was almost a good idea . above the law takes note of a video making the rounds of a bank robbery suspect in ohio . when an officer finds the alleged note to the teller and dumps it on the hood of the cruiser , the man eats it without the cops noticing . too bad for him , a dashboard cam captured it all .
