a symbol of america is once again flying high above one of the nation 's most historic cities . “ i had never seen one in my life before , ” tom palmer tells the boston globe . “ it ’ s exciting . these are american icons. ” late last month , the 60-year-old massachusetts resident spotted his first bald eagle . and he 's not alone . reports of bald eagle sightings are pouring in from around the boston area . " they are too big to escape notice , " palmer says . the ap reports there were 51 confirmed breeding pairs of bald eagles in the state last year . that 's the most since the birds were reintroduced to massachusetts in 1982 . and it 's part of a trend seen nationwide . there were 10,000 or so pairs of bald eagles in the continental us when they were taken off the endangered list in 2007 . that 's 20 times as many as in 1963 . one ornithologist says the resurgence is partly due to bald eagles getting more used to humans and humans getting more used to not shooting bald eagles . another says it 's a sign that the waters around boston are getting healthier , providing good fishing for breeding eagles . " once rare and threatened with extinction , the national symbol can now be seen from the comfort of your car , " the washington post states . but that can also be its own problem . bald eagles are increasingly being hit by cars while eating roadkill . last year , a 38-year-old bald eagle—the country 's oldest—suffered that fate . the problem is compounded by eagles getting lead poisoning by eating the remains of deer shot by hunters . " it 's like they 're flying drunk , " one veterinary director tells the post . ( some eagles may also be making themselves sick by eating euthanized animals . )
