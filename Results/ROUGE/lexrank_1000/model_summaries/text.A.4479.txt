" for the baptism , five people are needed—no more and no less , " reads the coded instructions . but this " baptism " is n't the usual sort : it 's for new members of the 'ndrangheta crime syndicate in italy , reports the telegraph . police discovered the instructions during a murder investigation , and two officers who like to solve puzzles got busy deciphering the text , which resembles ancient egyptian and greek . the big break came when they figured out the letter c , and the rest fell into place . it 's oh-so-dramatic stuff : the initiation must take place in a " sacred , sacrosanct , and secure " location , and the newbie must cut his skin with a knife in order to swear a blood oath— " an eternal allegiance to the honored society. ” the bbc reports that the 'ndrangheta is thought to be the most powerful mafia in italy , with a specialty in cocaine smuggling .
