president obama addressed the united nations as president for the final time on tuesday with a speech that urged world leaders make a " course correction " and be more open to refugees and less authoritarian . and he seemed to be take a shot , more than once , at donald trump 's vision of a big , beautiful wall . some lines from accounts by the ap , politico , reuters , abc news and nbc news : " today , a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself . " “ the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies. ” he also said , apparently in reference to zika , that " mosquitoes do n't respect walls . " " we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions , from their religion , their ethnicity , from their sense of nationhood . but i do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group . " " in countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions , politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero sum game . and so given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures , it 's no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman . a top-down model rather than strong democratic institutions . but i believe this thinking is wrong . " " history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths . permanent crackdown , which sparks strife at home , or scapegoating enemies abroad , which can lead to war . " " in a world that left the age of empire behind , we see russia attempting to recover lost glory through force . " " surely israelis and palestinians will be better off if palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel ... ( and if ) israel recognizes that it can not permanently occupy and settle palestinian land . " watch a video of the speech via usa today .
