one forensic expert tells the daily beast the claim is " ridiculous . " but being ridiculous never stopped the internet before : a theory has been making the rounds on social media ( and covered by outlets like usa today and buzzfeed ) that sandra bland was actually dead in her mugshot photo . the argument being put forth : the background 's photo looks like the cell floor ; she 's wearing an orange jumpsuit , while most mugshots taken at the jail feature street clothes ; her eyes look " flat , " as usa today puts it . but buzzfeed observes that " mugshots of other inmates at waller county jail ... were taken against a similar background . " and a two-page statement from the waller county sheriff 's department released thursday explained the jumpsuit . " depending on how many inmates are being processed at this time , an inmate 's photograph may be taken in their original clothing , or the inmate may be dressed out in orange , " it read . forensic pathologist michael baden shot down the theory in comments to usa today . the eyelids of the dead typically droop when open , he says , while her eyes appear " purposefully open . " he continues to the daily beast , " to say that she â€™ s dead from the photo is ridiculous because you can say that about almost any head photo . you have to use evidence . " and another forensic pathologist says a low-resolution photo will never be capable of providing that evidence . " from just looking at a photo , there are no signs . "
