" state-funded broadcaster rt has described the attack as having a " shocking resemblance " to the 1999 columbine mass shooting , with the attackers in both cases setting off explosives in cafeterias , shooting fellow students , and killing themselves in school libraries . political analyst sergey mikheyev blamed the attack on " western subculture , " cnn reports , which " builds its matrix on the cult of violence , " he said on state television . " the one who has a weapon in his hands is right . this is a purely american approach to the matter . " the death toll in the kerch attack reached 20—15 students and five teachers—after one of the injured died thursday , the ap reports . health minister veronika skvortsova says most victims died from gunshot wounds , but the shrapnel-packed explosive device caused many horrific injuries , with some victims losing their legs or feet . few details have been released on attacker vladislav roslyakov , an 18-year-old student at the school .
