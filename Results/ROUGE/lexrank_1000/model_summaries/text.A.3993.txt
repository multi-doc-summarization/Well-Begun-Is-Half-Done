a man who stopped for gas at a jerusalem gas station yesterday saw his day go downhill in a flash when cops say a woman peeved that he did n't give her a cigarette set his car on fire , per haaretz . security footage shows the woman walking up to the guy as he fills his tank ; she appears to say something to him , then momentarily walks away . but she 's back in a couple of seconds—with a lighter , a police statement says , per the independent—and as she holds her hand out to where the pump is connected to the car , the car ignites . the man was able to yank the pump out of the tank before he fled , and gas station workers put out the fire , the newspaper notes . the man 's brother , said to be in the car at the time , was also reportedly unharmed . israeli police arrested the woman , though she 's apparently denying all accusations , haaretz notes . ( cops say a california man returned to the gas station he robbed to apologize . )
