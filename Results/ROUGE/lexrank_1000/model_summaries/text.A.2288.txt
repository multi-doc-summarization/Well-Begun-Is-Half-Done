lauren mccluskey 's killer was a master manipulator who penned messages under various names—even posed as a police officer—in an effort to lure and extort the 21-year-old university of utah student before her death , according to police . nine days before she was fatally shot on campus by an ex-boyfriend later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound , mccluskey told university police she 'd wired $ 1,000 to an account to prevent the release of " compromising " photos of her and the killer , 37-year-old melvin rowland , says university police chief dale brophy , per fox news and espn . mccluskey had ended her relationship with the registered sex offender days earlier after discovering he 'd lied about his background . " if his lips were moving , he was lying , " brophy says of rowland , who described himself as a manipulator of women at a 2012 parole hearing . rowland told an acquaintance , for example , that he needed a gun because his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot , reports cbs news . after shooting mccluskey multiple times in the backseat of a car he ’ d driven to campus , rowland was picked up by a woman he 'd met online . before she recognized him as the murder suspect and called police , the pair went to dinner and back to the woman 's apartment where rowland showered before leaving , brophy says . meanwhile , the investigation into mccluskey 's extortion complaint had been delayed by workload issues , and the utah department of corrections had yet to be notified . gov . gary herbert announced an investigation into the handling of the case on thursday . hindsight is 20/20 , but " you never know when these things are going to occur , " he said . ( mccluskey was on the phone with her mom at the time . )
