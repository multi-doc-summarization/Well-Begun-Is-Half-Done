rick santorum may be at the top of the polls in ohio , but even if he wins there , he may not win . because his campaign missed several eligibility deadlines , he could lose up to 18 of the state 's 63 available delegates , report the cleveland plain dealer and abc news . in nine districts , santorum 's campaign filed either incomplete delegate slates or none at all . even worse , several of those problematic districts are areas where santorum was expected to perform well . santorum is not even on the ballot in virginia , and failed to file full slates in tennessee , new hampshire , and illinois , but the eligibility requirements in ohio were considered easier . santorum 's campaign said that because he is one of the leading candidates in the gop primaries , he should—and will—receive the full delegate count he wins on tuesday , but the romney campaign disagreed . “ the fact that he can not execute the simple tasks that are required to win the republican nomination proves that rick santorum is incapable of taking on president obama ’ s formidable political machine , " said the campaign . the state party would have the final say .
