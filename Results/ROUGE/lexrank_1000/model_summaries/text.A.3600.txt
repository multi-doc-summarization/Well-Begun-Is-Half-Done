it just got a whole lot less fun to be a catholic in philadelphia . new guidelines released by archbishop charles chaput last friday say divorced couples who have remarried must permanently abstain from sex , instead living like " brother and sister , " the guardian reports . according to the philadelphia inquirer , there are about 4.5 million us catholics who have been remarried without getting their first marriage annulled by the church . but divorcees are n't the only ones chaput wants to see living without sex . people in same-sex relationships and straight couples who are n't married must also go sexless . fortunately , the new guidelines explain that anyone can be in a successful heterosexual marriage with kids even with " some degree of same-sex attraction . " the guidelines , which come from one of the most conservative catholic leaders in the us , also recommend priests try to break up couples who are n't interested in getting married , which shows they 're " lacking in maturity , " and claims same-sex relationships will " produce moral confusion in the community . " anyone going against the guidelines should not receive holy communion and should be barred from positions of responsibility within the church . the six pages of guidelines are a direct response to pope francis ' joy of love document , which many saw as instructing bishops to be more accepting of " irregular " relationships . but one official with the philadelphia archdiocese says that document " may not have been as well expressed as it should have been . " chaput 's guidelines are meant to clarify it .
