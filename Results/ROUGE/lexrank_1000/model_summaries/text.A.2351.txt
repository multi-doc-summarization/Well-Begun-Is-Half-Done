if it works , it could be an air-traveling perk to trump all others : no more jet lag . airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new a350 xwb line of jets . the main tool is a set of led lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people 's natural circadian rhythms in sync , reports fast company . another factor : because of the planes ' relatively light frames , they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet , which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets , per quartz . a third factor is the jet 's filtration system , which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes . the idea there is that , if nothing else , the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights . and the big question : has it worked ? it 's a little too early to tell . the first such jet landed in the us only earlier this month via qatar airways , though other airlines plan to add the jet to their fleets , notes a post at science alert . ( this protein might provide another way to fight jet lag . )
