a court case out of england is pretty awful on all fronts : a judge sentenced a 23-year-old woman to 14 weeks in jail because she put her kitten in the microwave as punishment , reports the bbc . the 4-month-old cat initially survived the minute-long ordeal but died what vets said was probably a terrible death within two hours , reports metro . and what did it do to deserve the punishment ? the cat 's owner , laura cunliffe , found her goldfish on the kitchen floor in pieces . " this was an act of utterly horrendous cruelty on your part on an animal that , as far as i could see , had come to trust you and rely on you , " said the judge in barnsley . what 's worse is that cunliffe has a history of " psychotic depression , " and a family member shouted , " she has n't a clue , " as she was being led away . cunliffe set the microwave for 5 minutes but realized her mistake after a minute , removed the cat , and tried unsuccessfully to cool it down with water , reports the irish independent . the judge banned her from having pets for the rest of her life .
