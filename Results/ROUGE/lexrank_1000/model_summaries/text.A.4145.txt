it was quintessential pope francis : on a plane journey back from a foreign trip on sunday , the pontiff made a statement that once would have been considered jaw-droppingly radical . in a response to a reporter 's question , francis said the church should apologize for offending and discriminating against gays over the years , the bbc reports . " i believe that the church not only should apologize to the person who is gay whom it has offended , " he said , " but has to apologize to the poor , to exploited women , to children exploited for labor ; it has to ask forgiveness for having blessed many weapons . " francis stressed that when he says " the church , " he means christians . " the church is holy , we are sinners ! " he said . francis—who made waves three years ago when he asked : who am i to judge gays ? —has been hailed by gay rights groups for his groundbreaking statements , though he has reaffirmed church policy that actually having gay sex is sinful , the bbc notes . the pope was on his way home from armenia , where he once again enraged turkish authorities by describing the mass killing of armenians a century ago as genocide , reports cnn . he also addressed britain 's vote to leave the eu , saying that while " something ... is not working in that unwieldy union " and eu countries should be given more independence to creatively deal with their problems , " let 's not throw the baby out with the bathwater .
