a german professor has apologized after apparently barring a male indian student from an internship because of " the rape problem in india . " in a now-viral email response to a male student , posted on website quora , annette beck-sickinger wrote , " i do n't accept any indian male students for internships . " the university of leipzig professor continued , per time , " we hear a lot about the rape problem in india " and " i have many female students in my group , so this attitude is something i can not support . " beck-sickinger tells the hindustan times it was a " misunderstanding , " but a second student claims the professor also turned down his phd application , noting she was n't accepting " any male indian guests ... due to the severe rape problem in india . " beck-sickinger argues her comments were taken out of context and the first student was denied an internship because there were " no openings available in the laboratory , " cnn reports , per an official statement . she tells the hindustan times that the refusal followed an " unpleasant discussion " with the student . " i am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way , " she says . " i sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings i may have hurt . " still , germany 's ambassador to india has blasted beck-sickinger 's actions in an open letter . " let me make it clear at the outset that i strongly object to this , " michael steiner writes . " india is not a country of rapists . " he also notes india 's " lively , honest , sustained , and very healthy public debate " about sexual assault while slamming beck-sickinger 's " simplistic image " of indian people .
