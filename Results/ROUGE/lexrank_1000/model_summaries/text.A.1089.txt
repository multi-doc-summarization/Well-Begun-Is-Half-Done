progressives are issuing a challenge to incoming republican house members : if they are so dead-set on repealing health care reform , they should n't accept the taxpayer-funded congressional health plan . the fracas started when newly elected rep. andy harris made a fuss during an orientation because his coverage did n't begin right away , notes the huffington post . if all congressional republicans declined , it would save an estimated $ 2.4 million . " chump change ? yes , it is , " writes sam stein at huffpo . " that said , chump change seems to always at the heart of the most provocative political battles . " others : the issue may be opening for democrats to " create tension between the newly elected officials and the tea partiers who put them there by highlighting the disconnect between the freshmen republicans ' rhetoric and their actions , " writes tom jensen for public policy polling . republicans , however , say democrats are distorting the issueâ€”they want employer-based coverage to be the dominant system , and members of congress are employed by the government , notes the wall street journal . " still , the issue has become a rallying cry for liberal activists , " writes danny yadron .
