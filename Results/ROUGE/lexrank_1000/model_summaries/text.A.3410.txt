call it the " battle of the beards , " suggests robert samuelson of the washington post : paul krugman vs. ben bernanke . both are prominent economists , both have facial hair aplenty , and each has called the other " reckless . " krugman has been lambasting the fed for not doing enough to help the economy recover—even if it means boosting inflation . inflation , he argues , is n't so scary . rising prices would encourage people to buy now , not later , and it would reduce the " real " value of debt . but bernanke has said that " would be very reckless . " he observed that the fed 's inflation goals are a self-fulfilling prophesy—without them , companies would jack up prices . samuelson sides with ben , adding that prices could rise faster than wages , hurting spending . " none of this is preordained , " samuelson writes . " economists have exaggerated their understanding and control of the economy . people do n't often act according to academic theories . " krugman actually responded , praising samuelson for making " a serious effort " to tackle the tough issue . he still thinks he 's right , " but then , i would , would n't i ? "
