if it seems like it 's already gone on for years , we are currently 596 ( five hundred ninety-six ) days away from the election that will determine the next president of the united states of america . but we are only one day away from the first official hat getting tossed into the 2016 ring by one of the many who been circling it , and the houston chronicle reports that it belongs to texas sen. ted cruz . unnamed senior advisers say the republican will announce his candidacy tomorrow , skipping right past the exploratory committee fun ( looking at you , jim webb ) and going right for the hat-tossing . more unnamed sources confirm the pending announcement to the ap , which notes cruz will likely be soon joined by the likes of jeb bush , scott walker , rand paul , and marco rubio . and if 2016 does n't work out for cruz , he 'll keep his current day job until 2019 .
