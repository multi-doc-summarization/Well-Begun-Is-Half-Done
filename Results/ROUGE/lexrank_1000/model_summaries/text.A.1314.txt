it 's a convoluted story and , it turns out , a " diabolical " one . a california woman arrested over the summer and charged with posting " rape fantasy " ads on craigslist that invited men to violate her ex-fiance 's new wife has been cleared . it turns out the wife was allegedly behind the twisted caper , and now she 's in jail , the los angeles times reports . michelle hadley , 30 , " is an innocent victim of a diabolical scheme , " orange country da tony rackauckas said monday . the case made national headlines after hadley was accused of posting ads urging men to rape angela maria diaz , the pregnant wife of her ex , and ignore diaz 's screams and protests . last june , diaz called 911 tearfully telling cops that a man tried to rape her in her garage . cops busted hadley , who spent 88 days in jail , but now say diaz , 31 , was behind it all . the break in the case came when authorities were able to determine the ip addresses associated with the ads led to diaz 's and her father 's homes ; diaz allegedly used software that made the emails look as if they were sent by hadley . the daily beast reports the emails contained links to images of aborted fetuses and headless humans ; one email allegedly read , " i am his treasure princess , you are nothing . " another member of the da 's office calls diaz a " serial con artist " who allegedly faked being pregnant and having cervical cancer . authorities do n't believe diaz 's husband—an unnamed us marshal who married diaz in february after meeting her via online dating the month prior , per ktla—was in on the plot . now hadley , who once faced life in prison , says she 'll go back to her mba studies . diaz faces up to 12 years , 8 months in prison and 11 years in county jail if convicted . ( this woman was cleared in a zookeeper love triangle . )
