snapchat found itself with a marketing sensation on its hands late last year when it began selling funky-looking sunglasses called spectacles . the trick is they allow users to record quick videos and photos and send them directly to their snapchat accounts , but the catch was they were available only through vending machines that would turn up in random locales or through a now-shuttered pop-up store in manhattan , notes new york . now , however , parent company snap is selling them online at spectacles.com for $ 129 . just how crazy did demand get ? cnbc notes that the glasses were selling for up to $ 5,000 on secondary markets , adding that its own reporters stood in line for 18 hours to get them . ( there 's a limit of six per household for the new online purchases . ) snap has said the glasses have n't been big money-makers , but techcrunch thinks the new move is designed to show prospective ipo investors that they could be . the vending machines will go on hiatus for awhile , but they 're expected to resurface eventually .
