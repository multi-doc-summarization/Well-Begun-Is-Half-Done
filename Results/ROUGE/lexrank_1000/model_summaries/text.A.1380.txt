dinosaurs were scaly old things , right ? not so much , apparently . a science study of 150-million-year-old fossils uncovered in siberia is playing a big role in flipping that perception on its head , suggesting that nearly all dinosaurs actually sprouted feathers . at least five species of feathered dinosaurs have turned up in china over the last 20 years , all belonging to the theropod group of raptors . the latest fossils , however , come from a two-legged dinosaur in the ornithischian group , which national geographic says accounts for about half of all dinosaurs . " probably that means the common ancestor of all dinosaurs had feathers , " the study author says . the fossils have " completely changed our vision of dinosaurs , " he adds , per the bbc . a paleontologist not involved with the study calls it " fantastic " and says it revealed three types of feather imprints different from those of other feathered dinosaurs as well as those of modern birds : " i do n't know " why they had feathers , he says . " these animals could n't fly , that 's all we can tell you . " ( read about a dinosaur that did flyâ€”with four wings . )
