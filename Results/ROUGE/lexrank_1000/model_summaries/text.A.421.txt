disney has received a patent to take pictures of visitors ' feet at its theme parks , the los angeles times reports . specifically , the patent titled system and method using foot recognition to create a customized guest experience would scan guests shoes when they enter the park then track them as the move about . according to the orlando business journal , this would allow disney to track guests ' favorite rides and paths through the park . it could also allow them to have donald duck greet guests by name or get souvenir photos or videos to them more quickly . the scanners could discern everything from shoe color , to wear patterns , to gum stuck on the sole . disney filed for the patent back in 2015 ; it was issued by the us patent & trademark office on july 19 . the company , however , says it has no plans to actually use its foot camera patent . a spokesperson tells the times that disney files a lot of patents in an " ongoing effort to relentlessly innovate and push the boundaries of creativity and technology to create immersive experiences and legendary guest service . " disney had already decided against biometric scanning—such as fingerprinting , retinal scans , and facial recognition—to track visitors because it considers it too invasive , the stack reports . plus those methods can be thrown off by things like hats and sunglasses . the company also did n't want to track clothing because that would " require cameras that are visible to the person . " the shoe-scanning cameras throughout the park would be " out of a person 's line of sight . " ( but will members of " club 33 " have their photos taken ? )
