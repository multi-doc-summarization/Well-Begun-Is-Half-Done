president trump is calling for russia to be reinstated to the leading group of industrialized nations , now known as the group of seven , the ap reports . " now , i love our country . i have been russia 's worst nightmare , " trump told reporters on the south lawn of the white house friday morning as he prepared to leave for the g7 summit in canada , per politico . " but with that being said , russia should be in this meeting . why are we having a meeting without russia being in the meeting ? " he added : " whether you like it or not , and it may not be politically correct , but we have a world to run . and in the g7 , which used to be the g8 , they threw russia out . they should let russia come back in . because we should have russia at the negotiating table . " russia was ousted from the elite group in 2014 as punishment for president vladimir putin 's annexation of crimea and its support for pro-russian separatists in ukraine . the suspension was supported by the other members of the group : the us , canada , japan , france , germany , italy , and the uk . cnn notes trump 's remarks come after a public twitter battle thursday with french president emmanuel macron and canadian prime minister justin trudeau over new tariffs the us has hit its allies with for " national security " purposes .
