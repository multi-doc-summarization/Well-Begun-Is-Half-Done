previous studies have found teen marijuana use could result in cancer , asthma , respiratory problems , and psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucinations over time . that 's why researchers say the results of a new long-term study following teen pot smokers into their 30s are " a little surprising . " researchers who analyzed 408 males for health and social issues from age 14 to 26 , then checked back in with the participants at age 36 , found no connection between pot use and any of the aforementioned conditions . not only that , the study in psychology of addictive behaviors—an extension of the pittsburgh youth study of the 1980s—also found no apparent link between smoking marijuana as a teen and later depression , anxiety , allergies , headaches , or high blood pressure , according to a press release . the participants—54 % black , 42 % white—were classed into four groups : those who rarely or never used marijuana ( 46 % ) ; chronic users who started using the drug early ( 22 % ) ; those who picked up the habit as an adult ( 21 % ) ; and those who smoked marijuana only in their youth ( 11 % ) . " there were no differences in any of the mental or physical health outcomes that we measured regardless of the amount or frequency of marijuana used during adolescence , " a researcher explains . that means chronic users who smoked the drug 200 days a year on average at age 22 were no more likely to have health problems than those who rarely or never picked up a joint . researchers say the study should " help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana , " but " should not be taken in isolation " as negative health effects may appear in those with a genetic liability , per medical daily . ( marijuana apparently heals broken bones . )
