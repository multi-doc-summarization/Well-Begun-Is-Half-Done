" the daily beast takes a look at the curious and fascinating case of morgan , whom a new yorker profile once celebrated as " holden caulfield with a machine gun ; " executed in 1961 after a failed counterrevolution against castro 's turn toward communism , morgan is buried in an unmarked grave in havana . now , with us-cuba relations warming , his widow hopes that cuba will at last return his remains to american soil . " for me , he is a hero , " she says . " for the cuban people , he is a hero . he gave his life for my country . i promised i would do this . " morgan 's story is the stuff of movies ( and has in fact been optioned by george clooney ) : he became the only foreigner other than che to reach the cuban army 's highest rank , comandante ; fell in love with and married olga rodriguez ; and reportedly told the firing squad that executed him , " i kneel for no man . " but " once he died , much larger events eclipsed his story , " says michael sallah , the author of the yankee comandante . " he kind of got lost in history . " havana scrubbed mention of him , and his american citizenship was only restored in 2007 , notes the beast . but now , says a lawyer in ohio , where his widow wants to bury him , " we 're more optimistic because of recent developments . " says sallah : " no one should ever doubt his love of america . this is where morgan was from . this is where he learned freedom and democracy . " click for the beast 's full piece .
