goop is getting called out again . gwyneth paltrow 's lifestyle site should be investigated by california regulators , according to the watchdog group truth in advertising . tina announced on its website this week that it has compiled more than 50 instances of goop claiming , directly or indirectly , that certain products " treat , cure , prevent , alleviate the symptoms of , or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments , " fortune reports . those products , of course , are either sold by or promoted by goop , but goop does n't have the scientific evidence legally required to make such claims about the products , per tina . the watchdog group has submitted a complaint letter to two of the california food , drug , and medical device task force 's district attorneys requesting enforcement . a goop spokesperson reached out to buzzfeed ( which has helpfully compiled some of the products tina takes issue with , including a crystal said to treat infertility , hair treatments for depression , and a vaginal egg to prevent uterus slipping ) to say that tina 's claims are " misleading ... unsubstantiated and unfounded . " goop was also recently called out by nasa over body stickers supposedly containing spacesuit material , and soon after , a san francisco ob-gyn made headlines when she called out goop for promoting the aforementioned vaginal eggs , among other things . in fact , dr. jen gunter 's posts about goop spurred the website to issue a defense , with team goop writing : " as women , we chafe at the idea that we are not intelligent enough to read something and take what serves us , and leave what does not . we simply want information ; we want autonomy over our health .
