for years , campaigns such as nothing but nets have been trying to control the scourge of malaria—a blood disease spread by mosquito bites—by sending insecticide-laced nets to hard-hit regions ( mostly in africa ) . but a university of california-davis study has some bad news : researchers have discovered a hybrid " super mosquito " that seems to be resistant to the treated nets . the study published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences indicates that anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes in mali that cross-bred with the a. gambiae variety created the superinsect— " 'super ' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides , " says gregory lanzaro , the study 's lead author , in a press release . although he 's not surprised insecticide resistance is rising , it 's still worrisome : " it is resulting in the failure of the nets to provide meaningful control . " there were about 584,000 deaths from malaria in 2013 , 90 % of them occurring in africa , according to the world health organization ; every 60 seconds a child there dies from the disease , nothing but nets adds . but inroads have been made : intervention tactics , including insecticide-treated nets , helped cut the mortality rate 54 % in africa between 2000 and 2013 , the who notes—and in 2013 , 49 % of all african residents at risk for the disease ( up from a mere 3 % in 2004 ) had access to insecticide-laced nets . this new finding could throw a wrench in that progress , and new preventative measures will need to be explored .
