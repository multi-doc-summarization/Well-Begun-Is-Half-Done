the public will feel “ a certain shock ” at the security failures outlined in the unclassified report on the christmas day attack being released today , says national security adviser jim jones . in an interview with usa today , jones doesn ’ t downplay the miscues , saying president obama is “ legitimately and correctly alarmed ” that intelligence wasn ’ t acted upon . combined with the fort hood shooting , “ that ’ s two strikes , ” says jones . “ he certainly doesn ’ t want that third strike. ” meanwhile , a yemeni official confirmed a link between those attacks , telling the bbc that alleged would-be bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab had met with radical american cleric anwar al-awlaki , who authorities believe was also in contact with the fort hood shooter . abdulmutallab was recruited in london , the official said , then flew to yemen to meet awlaki . but he noted that the explosives were from nigeria , not yemen .
