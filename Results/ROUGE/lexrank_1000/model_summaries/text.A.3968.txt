surprisingly enough , this idea did n't come from silvio berlusconi : italy plans to include things like illegal drug sales , prostitution , and cigarette smuggling in its gdp figures for the first time , immediately giving the size of the economy a big boost , bloomberg reports . prime minister mario renzi has pledged to cut the country 's deficit to 2.6 % of gdp , a target that will be a lot easier to hit when illegal sectors of the economy are included . the european union 's statistical agency has provided guidelines for estimating the contribution of illegal activities to the economy , and the move is expected to add up to 2 % to italy 's gdp , ansa reports . ( as for berlusconi , he 's doing community service at a hospice after being convicted of tax fraud . )
