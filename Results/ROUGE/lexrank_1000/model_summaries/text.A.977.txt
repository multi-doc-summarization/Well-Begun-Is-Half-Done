( president trump had accused cuomo of being a purveyor of " fake news " earlier in the day . ) cuomo 's analogy drew quick condemnation online , and he soon walked it back in a tweet : " i was wrong . calling a journalist fake ( is ) nothing compared to the pain of a racial slur . i should not have said it . i apologize . " meanwhile , a blogger at the washington post makes the case that the charge of " fake news " has lost all meaning because it is used so often by politicians who simply dislike a story .
