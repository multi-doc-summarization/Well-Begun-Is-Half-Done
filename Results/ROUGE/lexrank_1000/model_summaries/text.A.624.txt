tennessee virtual academy , a for-profit , online public school heavily supported by state republicans , has found a novel way of boosting student performanceâ€”just delete bad grades , reports news channel 5 in nashville . a leaked december email from the school 's vp appears to tell its middle-school teachers to erase some scores that do n't measure up . " if you have given an assignment and most of your students failed that assignment , then you need to take that grade out , " it reads . " to me , this appears like it 's grade fixing , " said one democratic state representative . virginia-based parent company k12 is refusing to talk , but the tva principal said the deletions were intended to " more accurately recognize students ' current progress . " but as the two-year-old school will receive $ 7.5 million in funding from the state this year , many tennessee lawmakers are outraged . the knoxville news sentinel reports that a house bill that proposed shutting the school altogether was killed yesterday ; a second was passed by the house education subcommittee . it would allow the state to shutter a virtual school that records sub-standard student performance two years in a row . ( meanwhile , a lehigh university student is suing over a bad grade . )
