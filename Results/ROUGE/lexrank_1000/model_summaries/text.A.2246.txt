did shia labeouf 's crazy night on broadway last week finally convince him it 's time to get help ? maybe : after he was kicked out of a theater and arrested thursday night , labeouf checked into rehab in la yesterday , x17 reports . labeouf was also seen toting alcoholics anonymous literature , radar notes , adding that this is n't labeouf 's first experience with aa : he reportedly celebrated 60 days of sobriety at an aa meeting in 2008 , and in 2011 he admitted he was an alcoholic publicly and was seen attending meetings . as tmz points out in numerous articles , the broadway incident was just the latest bit of misbehavior from labeouf : last month he was banned from an la restaurant for peeing on its outside wall ; earlier this month he was recorded trying to fight outside a new york strip club ; and hours before his arrest thursday , he chased a homeless man after a weird argument over a hat the guy was wearing . and then , of course , there was his 2011 bar brawl , his 2014 bar brawl , that whole debacle with alec baldwin , the paper bag incident , and his bizarre plagiarized apology tour .
