next time someone complains that american tv has gone a little too far , suggest they take a look at the new gimmick of one of pakistan 's most popular shows : free baby giveaways . as in , actual human babies . host aamir liaquat hussain gave away two infant girls last month and plans to keep going , reports reuters . witness the posting on his website : " if any family can not afford to bring up their new born baby due to poverty or illness then instead of killing them , they should hand over the baby to dr aamir . " the first two babies were provided by a pakistani aid organization that takes in abandoned infants , and both the show and the organization insist that the recipients were vetted . " if we did n't find this baby , a cat or a dog would have eaten it , " hussain told his cheering audience before handing over one of the baby girls to a childless couple . reuters explains that pakistan has loosened its control over broadcasting in recent years , leading to a slew of such ratings-grabbing stunts . cnn describes this particular show , aman ramazan , as a pakistani version of the price is right . audience members typically win prizes for correctly answering questions about the koran . only now , the show is giving away babies along with fridges and microwaves .
