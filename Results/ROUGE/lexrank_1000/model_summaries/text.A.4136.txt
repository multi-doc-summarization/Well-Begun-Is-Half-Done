with just over four months to go until election day , hillary clinton and donald trump are locked in battle over the shape of a star . in a statement issued monday , the clinton campaign 's director of jewish outreach slammed the trump campaign 's use of a star of david in an anti-clinton image as " blatantly anti-semitic , " reports the new york times , which notes that mic traced the image to a message board used by white supremacists . trump , however , tweeted : " dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff 's star , or plain star . " dan scavino , trump 's social media director , said the image had been " lifted from an anti-hillary twitter user where countless images appear . " trump later issued a statement on his website saying the star is used by " sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior " and that clinton " is just trying to divert attention from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband . " anti-defamation league ceo jonathan greenblatt was n't buying the " sheriff 's badge " line , the guardian reports . he told cnn on monday that the trump campaign has had a troubling tone for months . the first couple of times trump did things like retweet images from white supremacists could be called mistakes , he said . " but we 're now at the sixth or seventh time the trump campaign has invoked bigotry or racism . it 's a pattern that â€™ s perplexing , troubling , and wrong . "
