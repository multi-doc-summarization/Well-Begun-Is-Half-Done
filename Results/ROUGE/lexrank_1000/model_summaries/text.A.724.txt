poor kim : not only have her fairy tale dreams been shattered â€¦ now she also has to deal with a joyfully pregnant sister while she goes through divorce proceedings . yep , kourtney kardashian and boyfriend scott disick are expecting again . " now i 'm nine weeks along . you 're supposed to wait 12 weeks to tell people , but i feel confident , " says kourtney , who was apparently confident enough to announce her plans in an us cover story . the couple already has a son , mason , who is almost two . " it was n't like we were n't trying , " says disick , who apparently does n't have a firm grasp on either the specifics of procreation or double negatives . " we kind of just said , 'if it 's meant to be , it 'll be . ' " meanwhile , rather than signing the divorce papers , kris humphries is seeking a legal separation from kim kardashian , people reports . his plan is to get an annulment rather than a divorce . in more fun kardashian news , the daily mail has a spectacular rant against the whole clan from daniel craig 's recent gq interview . " look at the kardashians , they 're worth millions , " says the james bond star . " i do n't think they were that badly off to begin with but now look at them . you see that and you think , 'what , you mean all i have to do is behave like a f***ing idiot on television and then you 'll pay me millions ? ' "
