the captain who was " distracted " when the costa concordia sailed smack into a rock finally took to tv yesterday to at last say sorry , though it does n't sound like the passion quotient was too high . " when there 's an accident , it 's not just the ship that 's identified or the company , " said francesco schettino according to reuters , which took note of his " pronounced tic " in one eye . " the captain is identified and so it 's normal that i should apologize as a representative of this system . " and while he did fault the fact that he was distracted , he pointed out that another officer was sailing the ship at the time of the incident . more not-exactly-heart-wrenching comments : " this was a banal accident in which there was a breakdown in the interaction between human beings ... it was as though there was a blackout in everyone 's heads and in the instruments . " the bbc notes that he did get choked up at one point , though : when asked about the 5-year-old who was among the more than 30 who died , he was unable to speak . schettino was released from house arrest last week , but faces multiple manslaughter charges .
