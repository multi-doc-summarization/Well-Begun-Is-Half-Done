" three of the signatories control large amounts of territory , cnn reports . the jihadis are n't the only ones dismissing the opposition government , either . syria 's deputy foreign minister yesterday dismissed the coalition as having little influence , the new york times reports . he further dimmed the prospect of peace talks by saying the regime would n't negotiate with anyone who 'd taken up arms against it , though it might talk to religious leaders " who have influence on the ground .
