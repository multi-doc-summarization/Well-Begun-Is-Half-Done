president trump trotted out a familiar whipping boy on saturday , tweeting that amazon was screwing over none other than the united states postal service . " the u.s. post office will lose $ 1.50 on average for each package it delivers for amazon , " he tweeted , adding that " that amounts to billions of dollars . " trump says the usps should jack its parcel rates , hitting amazon with a $ 2.6 billion hike . " this post office scam must stop . amazon must pay real costs ( and taxes ) now ! " he tweeted . trump 's criticism has hit amazon in the wallet , notes cnbc , with its stock taking a 6 % slide in the last five trading days . trump also took a swipe at another favorite jeff bezos-owned punching bag : the washington post , which he says " is used as a 'lobbyist ' and should so register . " the ap fact-checks trump 's claims and finds that " trump is misrepresenting amazon 's record on taxes , the u.s . postal service 's financial situation and the contract that has the post office deliver some amazon orders . federal regulators have found that contract to be profitable for the postal service . " though it acknowledges that a 2017 study found that usps parcel rates were below market rates .
