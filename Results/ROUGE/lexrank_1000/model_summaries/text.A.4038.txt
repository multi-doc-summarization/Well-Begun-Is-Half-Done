top government officials from the koreas met over the weekend in the border town of panmunjom to discuss keeping the peace , reuters reports . but north korea seems to be hedging its bets after a south korean military official said that 50 of its northern foe 's submarines have disappeared , the yonhap news agency reports . " seventy percent of north korea 's submarines left their bases , and their locations are not confirmed , " an official told reporters yesterday , adding , per chosun ilbo , " scores of subs that have left their bases on the eastern and western coasts are off our radar , which is an unprecedentedly serious situation . " the main concern is that the subs could cross the northern limit line ( the maritime line in the sand between the two countries ) or take on south korean navy vessels in surprise attacks from the rear , the paper notes . it adds that although north korean submarines—described by the national post as " largely outdated and technically obsolescent versions produced in the 1960s for the soviet union " —make a lot of noise ( meaning they should be easy to find ) , there are so many missing it would be hard to keep track of them all . also worrisome , per the military official : north korea has apparently doubled its number of artillery troops along the dmz since friday , per chosun ilbo . " they seem ready to shoot , " the official says . ( pyongyang declaring a " quasi-state of war " does n't sound good . )
