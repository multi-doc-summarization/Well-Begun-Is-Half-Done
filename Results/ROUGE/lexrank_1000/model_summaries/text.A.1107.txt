margot wölk spent two and a half years tasting adolf hitler 's food , living in fear that one of the delicious dishes might be poisoned . now 95 , wölk—who , with time , learned to take pleasure in eating again—just started talking about her experiences . " there was never meat because hitler was a vegetarian , " wölk tells der spiegel . " the food was good—very good . but we could n't enjoy it . " as germany went hungry , wölk tasted things like white asparagus in sauce made with real butter , noodle dishes , and exotic fruits . she was ordered into the food-tasting service by the ss after she fled berlin for the east prussian village of gross-partsch , located less than two miles from hitler 's " wolf 's lair , " at age 24 . she and 14 other young women made sure the allied forces had n't poisoned the food ; then it was served to hitler . a lieutenant ultimately saved her life when the soviet army was closing in , sending her on a train to berlin . she later learned the other food tasters were shot by the soviet soldiers ; she herself was eventually caught by the soviet army , and raped repeatedly . in 1946 , she was finally reunited with her husband , who had been at war and imprisoned . she finally decided to talk about her life because , she says , " i just wanted to say what happened there . that hitler was a really repugnant man . and a pig . " hers is not the only fascinating world war ii story to emerge this week : the ap reports that a virginia farm , used during the war as a refuge for jews escaping germany , has been added to the state 's landmarks register .
