the fat lady may have sung on the presidential race last night , but results are still trickling in from some of the country 's closest races . so far , everything 's coming up blue ; democrats have extended their senate majority to 53 , not counting the two independents expected to poll with them , after winning a pair of nail biters . in north dakota , former attorney general heidi heitkamp has scored what politico terms an " upset " win over rep. rick berg to claim the last unsettled senate seat of the election . heitkamp won with fewer than 3,000 votes , the ap reports , a margin so small that berg could have demanded a recount , but he instead conceded late this afternoon . earlier , democrat sen. jon tester won an excruciatingly close re-election battle over rep. denny rehberg , after a bitter campaign that dominated montana politics for two years , the missoulian reports . tester likely benefited from a strong performance by libertarian dan cox , who managed 6 % of the voteâ€”most of it likely at rehberg 's expense .
