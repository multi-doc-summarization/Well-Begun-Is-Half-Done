we do n't want to know how many pills it took to kill this hangover : two buddies went out for a few drinks at a pub in marton , england , last friday . hours later , they were in thailand , a la hangover ii . the idea for the spontaneous trip sprouted around 11am saturday at phillip boyle 's place . the men had headed there from the pub around 1am for a " quiet night " after picking up a " few drinks from the petrol station , " boyle , 33 , tells gazettelive in a story spotted by usa today . friend jamie blyth " asks if i have my passport handy and comes up with the idea of us going to thailand straight away , " says boyle . " then we got into a taxi he 'd phoned and—apart from the short delay of picking up jamie 's passport—we were off . " it was " all a bit rash , " says boyle , whose luggage consisted of a grocery bag containing a few shirts and some underwear . the men booked two seven-hour flights spanning 6,750 miles , heading for the beachside city of pattaya ; they apparently " knew some guys from school " in thailand . " on the way out there we sobered up on the flight and thought 'what have we done ! ' " blyth tells gazettelive . but they made the most of the adventure , which ran through tuesday . it was " brilliant fun , " boyle says . " we went out for meals and to bars and did n't really sleep that much . " he adds , " i 'm feeling okay now . " the guys admit they did face consequences . " i have fallen behind with a few things at work , " boyle says . blyth adds his new girlfriend " was a bit annoyed , " but " she 's just been laughing about it and thought we were daft . " ( a night of drinking did n't end so well for one qatar airways employee . )
