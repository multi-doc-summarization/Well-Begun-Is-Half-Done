as the boston carjacking victim known only as " danny " continues to recount his story of what happened during his encounter with the tsarnaev brothers , cnn has what might be the strangest detail of all . danny says that while tamerlan made threats , blustered about his hatred of americans , and generally acted as ringleader , dzhokhar asked only one question the whole time : he wanted to know how much danny paid for the mercedes suv they were riding in . at another point , the chinese immigrant tells cbs that his phone rang . " if you do n't want me to pick up the phone , i wo n't pick it up , " he told tamerlan . " i wo n't say anything . " tamerlan " told me that you have to answer the phone . but if you use any single word in chinese , i will kill you . " danny complied , and when he hung up tamerlan said , " good job . good boy . "
