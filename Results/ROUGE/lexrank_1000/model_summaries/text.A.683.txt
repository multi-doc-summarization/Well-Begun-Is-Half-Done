as the search for malaysia airlines flight 370 continues , an " object of interest " has turned up in southwestern australiaâ€”but officials are cautioning that it may not offer much of a breakthrough . " it 's sufficiently interesting for us to take a look at the photographs , " says an australian official . but " the more we look at it , the less excited we get . " an insider tells cnn the object 's size is unclear based on photos , but it 's " kind of rectangular " with rivets and an apparent fiberglass coating . meanwhile , the bluefin-21 underwater robot has completed more than 80 % of its planned search without finding anything , the ap reports . but the overall investigation wo n't stop anytime soon : indeed , it could continue for years , cnn notes . " the next phase , i think , is that we step up with potentially a more powerful , more capable side-scan sonar to do deeper water , " says australia 's defense minister . adds australian pm tony abbott . " we are not going to abandon ... the families of the 239 people who were on that plane by lightly surrendering while there is reasonable hope of finding something . "
