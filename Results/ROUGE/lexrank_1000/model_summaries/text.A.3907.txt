nypd officer randolph holder was shot dead tuesday , and by saturday quentin tarantino was in washington square park , protesting " murderers " —not the ones going after cops , but the cops themselves . " when i see murders , i do not stand by … i have to call a murder a murder , and i have to call the murderers the murderers , " tarantino said during the " rise up october " rally , per the new york post , adding too often it is cops who kill . the head of the nypd 's labor union was n't impressed and responded by asking locals to boycott the director 's films , including the upcoming hateful eight . " it 's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater , too , " patrick lynch , president of the patrolmen 's benevolent association , said in a statement , via the post . " new yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous 'cop fiction . ' " about 300 people gathered for the rally , chanting and holding up signs that said things like " rise up ! stop police terror ! " and " murder with a badge is still murder . " tarantino concedes that the timing so soon after holder 's killing was " unfortunate , " but he also says people had already traveled to attend , the post notes . " i 'm a human being with a conscience , " tarantino says , per the ap . " and if you believe there 's murder going on , then you need to rise up and stand up against it . … i 'm on the side of the murdered . " not everyone sees it that way . " the police officers that quentin tarantino calls 'murderers ' are n't living in one of his depraved big-screen fantasies—they 're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime , " lynch continues in his statement . one of holder 's cousins tells the post that the rally was " very disrespectful . " " everyone forgets that behind the uniform is a person , " she says .
