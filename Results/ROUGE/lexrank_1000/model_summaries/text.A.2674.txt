see you in court , eh ? transcanada , a canadian company hit hard by president obama 's rejection of its keystone xl pipeline project , has filed twin lawsuits seeking $ 15 billion in damages and a reversal of the us decision , the new york times reports . one lawsuit , filed under the north american free trade agreement , seeks damages because the permit rejection was " arbitrary and unjustified , " reports reuters . the suit claims that obama overstepped his authority because of his " unprecedented and symbolic grounds " for turning down the project , which he argued would bring " dirtier crude oil into our country " while doing little to boost the american economy . the second lawsuit , filed in a federal court in houston , calls for a reversal of obama 's " unconstitutional " decision and a ruling that no future president can block the pipeline project , reports reuters . a canadian trade lawyer tells the globe and mail that it 's tough to predict how these kinds of lawsuits will go , but that transcanada 's argument that it was treated unfairly because the issue had become politicized appears solid . the times notes that a win for the canadian company would be unprecedented : in the 22 years of the nafta agreement , the us has won all 12 of the challenges it faced from canadian firms , while us firms have prevailed in trade agreement cases in canada .
