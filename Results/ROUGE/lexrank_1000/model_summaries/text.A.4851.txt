jared fogle remains very busy trying to get himself out of jailâ€”and apparently keeping up with current events . the former subway pitchman 's new legal gambit revolves around the case of disgraced team usa gymnastics doctor larry nassar , reports the blast . in newly filed legal documents , fogle complains that he was charged with " traveling for the purpose of engaging in illicit sex " while he was on the road for subway , but nassar was not similarly charged even though he committed crimes while on the road with the gymnasts . fogle apparently sees this as an example of how the case against him was unfair . he also says he was pressured into pleading guilty and wants to withdraw his pleas to charges of distribution and receipt of child pornography and traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor . tmz points out that fogle is serving a 15-year sentence , while nassar has no hope of ever leaving prison , raising the question of why fogle would take the risk of withdrawing his pleas to get a new trial . ( fogle previously said the judge was biased because she has daughters . )
