a florida landscaper faces prison time after he mowed down a family of ducklings . jason falbo , 24 , claims it was unintentional , but a couple and their young son who watched the scene unfold are n't buying it , and , so far , neither are police , reports the palm beach post . it happened in wellington , as falbo mowed the back yard of boyd jentzsch and laura gontchar . the husband and wife had put food out for the ducklings and were watching with their 7-year-old son as the mother duck led them out of a lake to feed . that 's when they say falbo deliberately headed for the ducks on his riding mower , ran them over , and hit them again in reverse . seven died instantly , and two more made it back to the water and drowned , say police . only the mother and two ducklings survived . " we were horrified , " jentzsch tells the sun sentinel . he , his wife , and their son , kai , ran after falbo as he neared the ducks screaming for him to stop , to no avail . the family says falbo was laughing on his second pass over the ducks . they booted him from the property and called animal control , and falbo was charged with nine counts of animal cruelty . his employer tells cbs12 that falbo is " kind-hearted " and would n't have run over the ducks on purpose . he says falbo did n't see them in the tall grass and backed up after the first pass only because he wanted to avoid hitting more ducks in front of him . he is being held on $ 27,000 bond . ( elsewhere in florida , a woman faces animal cruelty charges over goldfish . )
