death row inmates in texas can no longer request special last meals , and they can blame racist killer lawrence russell brewer . before he was executed this week , brewer ordered up a texas-sized feast , according to the austin american-statesman : " two chicken fried steaks , a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger , a cheese omelet , large bowl of fried okra , 3 fajitas and a pound of barbeque with a half-loaf of white bread on the side . " plus a pint of ice cream for dessert . the problem : he barely touched it . when that tidbit surfaced , a state lawmaker complained : “ enough is enough . it is extremely inappropriate to give a person sentenced to death such a privilege … one which the perpetrator did not provide to their victim. ” state prison officials quickly announced the end of the program : those about to die will get what all the other prisoners are getting . daily intel has more on the fascination about last meals .
