india has earned a reputation as a place that 's dangerous for women and girls , underscored by the story of a 10-year-old rape victim now in the news for trying to get permission to get an abortion . another shocking story from 2012 set off a series of protests across the country after a young woman was fatally gang-raped on a public bus , and—along with many other high-profile sexual assaults—has prompted countries like the us to caution women not to travel alone in india . now the indian airline vistara has taken matters into its own hands , offering a free service called woman flyer , which it describes to bloomberg as a " sincere effort to ensure peace of mind of our women customers . " the free service , which launched in march , is used by between 75 and 100 women every day , according to vistara . women who sign up for the service will get help with their bags , be guaranteed a window or aisle seat , and be escorted to a pickup point by airline staff , reports emirates woman . while this is thought to be the first airline anywhere to offer this kind of service , air india began providing female-only rows earlier this year in response to assaults in the air . in 2015 , researchers in the uk noted that in places with gender equality , separating women " reinforces a message that women must be contained and segregated in order to protect them , " but many who are hailing vistara 's new service says safety comes first . ( that 10-year-old mentioned earlier is being made to deliver her baby . )
