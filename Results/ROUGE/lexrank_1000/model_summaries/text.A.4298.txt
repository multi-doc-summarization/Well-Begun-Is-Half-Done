police in three states are still hunting for a range rover whose occupants opened fire on another car on the vegas strip this morning and set off a deadly chain reaction . cops do n't know most of the details , but they say it started with a dispute of some kind in one of the nearby hotels , then spilled into the street , reports the las vegas sun . when the range rover caught up to a maserati at a stop light , shots were fired from the suv that sent the maserati crashing into a taxi , which exploded upon impact . three people—the maserati driver , the taxi driver , and a taxi passenger—were killed , and three others were injured , reports the la times . police are hoping to piece together more details by interviewing a passenger in the maserati , who was injured in the melee . earlier reports that gunfire came from both vehicles as part of a moving shootout were incorrect . the ap collects this quote from a tourist visiting from manchester , england : " this does n't happen where we come from , not on this scale . we get stabbings , and gang violence , but this is like something out of a movie . like die hard or something .
