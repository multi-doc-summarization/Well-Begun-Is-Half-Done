a new study says one in seven us colon cancer patients is younger than 50â€”raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it , reports healthday via the philadelphia inquirer . " colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly , " says lead author samantha hendren . " this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50 . " using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011 , the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery ( 72 % compared to 63 % of patients over 50 ) . the young are also more likely to use radiation therapy ( 53 % to 48 % ) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years ( 68 % to 67 % ) . younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms ( like colon blockage , bleeding , and anemia ) , while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings , says hendren . " unfortunately , these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids , " a scientist adds , per reuters . hendren 's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people , medical daily reports , but that spike remains unexplained . physical inactivity , obesity , smoking , and " an effect in our environment " are all possible causes , a harvard professor says . more screenings for young people might help , but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer . " this would be a big and costly change , " says hendren , who recommends " a lot of research " be done first . ( a new killer is expected to top cancer by 2050 . )
