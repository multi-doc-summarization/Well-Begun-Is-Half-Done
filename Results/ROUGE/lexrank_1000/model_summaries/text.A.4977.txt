( see video . ) they rip nets and clog hooks , and wash up on beaches to the consternation of the locals . one researcher began spotting the " sea pickles " in nets in february and since then , the numbers have exploded , per oregon public broadcasting . one research boat captured 60,000 within minutes . " they were glowing and floating on the surface , completely covering the sea , " says university of oregon researcher hilarie sorensen . the creatures—their greek name means " fire bodies " —prefer the tropics , but even there , they have n't been seen in the " insane " numbers of this year 's bloom , says sorensen . the impact of the little cucumbers is unknown , but there is concern their massive presence could foul ecosystems . while the bloom could be a natural phenomenon , dr. lisa-ann gershwin says " an abundance this gobsmackingly big " indicates something fishy may be going on . warming seas could be a possible explainer , or perhaps changes in the marine food supply or shifting currents . ( killer whales are also tormenting alaskan fishermen . )
