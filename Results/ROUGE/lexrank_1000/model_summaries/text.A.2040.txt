if idle hands are the devil 's hands , greece is finding out the hard way : gunmen this morning stormed microsoft 's athens headquarters , ramming the building with a gasoline-laden van before setting fire to it . the attack injured no one , but heavily damaged the building 's first floor and shut the office for at least the day , in what reuters notes is the latest in a series of arson hits on banks and foreign companies as anger simmers over high unemployment and austerity measures in the financially strapped nation . no one has claimed responsibility for the microsoft attack , but the ap notes that anarchist or radical left-wing groups are usually responsible .
