a convicted child killer just got a last-minute reprieve from ohio 's governor , thanks to the inmate 's unusual request to be an organ donor . ronald phillips , who raped and murdered the 3-year-old daughter of his girlfriend , was supposed to be put to death tomorrow morning . instead , gov . john kasich has postponed the execution until july while the state considers phillips ' plea to donate organs to family members or anyone else who might need them , reports the columbus dispatch . " i realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for ohio , but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen , ” said kasich . if doctors think phillips ' non-vital organs can be harvested , he would undergo surgery before his execution , reports the cleveland plain dealer . this is n't the only reason phillips ' case is making headlines—prison officials plan to use an untested combination of drugs because of a shortage of the standard pentobarbital .
