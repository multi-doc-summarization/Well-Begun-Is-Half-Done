jimmy fallon devoted an entire episode of the tonight show on wednesday to bidding farewell to first lady michelle obama , whom he called " a strong , smart , independent woman , an activist , a style icon , and a great dancer . " obama was fallon 's sole guest , though dave chappelle and jerry seinfeld appeared for a game of catchphrase . obama even helped fallon write his usual " thank you " notes , penning " thank you , barack , for proving you 're not a lame duck but my very own silver fox , " per the washington post . she was then serenaded by her favorite singer stevie wonder , who altered the lyrics of " my cherie amour , " singing " my michelle amour , you 're the only one that we adore … you 'll always be first lady in our lives . " there were more serious moments , too . as guests delivered emotional farewell messages to a photo of obama during one segment , the first lady jumped out from behind a curtain , leaving a few in tears . obama also told fallon that the end of her husband 's term has " been surprisingly emotional for all of us . " she said she felt like crying when thinking " about the fact that some [ kids ] are afraid of the future , of what is to come . i do n't want them to be afraid , " but rather " embrace the future … with strength and with hope , " per the new york daily news . obama added she would return to the white house if invited by the trump administration , but she plans to stay involved in the initiatives she set up as first lady " as long as i live .
