there 's an app for pretty much everything—except cutting through bureaucracy . a woman who mistakenly left her ipad on a plane was able to track the whereabouts of the device , but could n't convince authorities to follow up on it , reports the syracuse post-standard , via the consumerist . the woman was fairly certain she left the ipad on a plane after deboarding in new york city , and after leaving messages with american airlines , she used the gps function of mobileme to find that the ipad was in a house on long island . she contacted airline and law-enforcement authorities with the exact location , but no action was taken . she suspects an airline employee pocketed the ipad because it then made several trips back and forth between jfk airport and california . she ca n't trace it anymore because she replaced the ipad and shut off wireless service to the old one . at one point , she used an app to make it beep every two minutes . “ i just wanted to harass who ever took it , ” she said . “ i didn ’ t want him to enjoy it if he was using it . ”
