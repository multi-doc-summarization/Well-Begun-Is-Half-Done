there 's quite a difference between making $ 58,000 a year and $ 270,000 , and that huge gap is why some are now poking around to see how a san francisco janitor has been pulling in the latter . the san francisco chronicle reports on liang zhao zhang , who cleans the bart system 's station at powell street and has a base salary of $ 57,945 , per public records culled by transparent california . but thanks to about $ 162,000 in hefty overtime pay and other compensation and benefits , zhang raked in what amounts to $ 271,243 in 2015 . robert fellner , a research director for the watchdog group , tells ktvu he 's been keeping an eye on public employee salaries for years and has never seen a janitor get paid such an " obscene " and " unconscionable " amount . nearly 50 other unaudited bart janitors also earned in the six figures in 2015 . fellner wants to know , for instance , how the " superhuman " zhang worked 17-hour days for 18 days in a row during july 2015 , a fact found during an analysis of zhang 's timecards , which turned up several " discrepancies and questions . " roy aguilera , bart 's chief transportation officer , says zhang just grabs extra hours no one wants . but when ktvu gained access to video on bart 's security cameras for two random days , it witnessed zhang head into a storage closet and hole up there for hours ( on one day he was in the closet for 90 minutes , then later on for another 78 ) . a bart rep says zhang may have been fixing equipment or taking a break , though aguilera tells ktvu there 's a dedicated break area elsewhere . fellner says the situation is a " catastrophic management failure " that should 've been audited long ago . ( the worst-paying jobs you have to go to college for . )
