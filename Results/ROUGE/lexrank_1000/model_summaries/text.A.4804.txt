it costs more than a penny to make a penny . the us mint produced more than 8.4 billion of the one-cent coins last year , at a cost of $ 0.0182 each with production costs and shipping taken into account . that means $ 69 million was lost when compared to the pennies ' total value , quartz reports , the biggest loss in nine years . that 's probably because zinc ( pennies are made mostly of zinc , with a small amount of copper ) has been rising in price . nickels , which are worth five cents , cost seven cents each to make , but dimes and quarters cost less than their value to produce , which ends up making up for the losses associated with pennies and nickels . even so , petitions abound on the internet to abolish the penny and nickel .
