goes-16 , the fancy new satellite developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , is sending its first photos back to earth since it lifted off from cape canaveral on nov. 19 , and the high-res results are causing astronomers and meteorologists to squeal with delight . one developer compared it to seeing a newborn baby 's first pics— " it 's that exciting for us , " noaa reports . space.com calls the super high-res images " jaw-dropping , " while nasa reports that the first images , from 22,300 miles up , catch details including dust blowing off the coast of africa , shallow waters in the caribbean , and mountain wave clouds in argentina . ( see a gallery here . ) the hope is that viewing our own planet and the atmosphere around it in such detail ( " high definition from the heavens , " per noaa ) will provide data for more accurate weather forecasts that could save lives . accuweather reports that the " stunning " images boast resolution that is four times greater than the capability of the best current satellites . noaa says the second ( goes-s ) in a series of four sophisticated satellites is undergoing a year of testing at lockheed martin ’ s corporation facility in littleton , colo. , and nasa reports that it is expected to launch in 2018 . goes-16 captures a full image of earth every 15 minutes and one of the continental us every five minutes , and it can scan five times faster than current goes imagers .
