precious star gabourey sidibe is on the new cover of elle , and her image has set off a tiff in the blogosphere on whether the magazine used digital retouching to " whiten " her . here 's julianne hing at colorlines : " elle clearly couldn ’ t handle sidibe ’ s real skin color , and traded away her actual color for something dramatically lighter . " ( see popeater for comparison photos . ) the magazine is also taking criticism for posing her differently than other models ( more of a face closeup than a body shot ) in an apparent attempt to play down her weight . elle says this is all crazy : " we have four separate covers this month , and gabby 's cover was not retouched any more or less than the others . ... if you take a look at the portfolio , each of the women were shot in different ways and for different reasons . " at entertainment weekly , annie barrett thinks the criticism is overblown . elle 's explanation on retouching is sound . on the other point , " they constructed the sidibe cover in a specific way so that she would look her best , and she looks beautiful . is it really so jarring to see someone heavy on a magazine cover that people need to freak out over how it 'should look ' instead ? this is how it looks .
