one of president obama 's biggest goals for his home stretch in office took a big step forward today with a deal struck by leading republicans and democrats . it 's regarding the trans-pacific partnership , a proposed pact with 11 pacific rim nations that the hill notes would be the biggest trade deal since nafta . in this case , the usual dc politics are flipped : most democrats oppose the president and most republicans support him , reports the wall street journal . despite today 's progress—it was introduced as " fast-track " legislation in the house and senate—its ultimate fate is unclear in congress . the new york times predicts that for obama , it will be " one of the toughest legislative battles of his last 19 months in office . " making it fast-track legislation means that lawmakers would vote yes or no on the deal once the us and the other nations agree on terms , but they would not be able to add amendments . that greatly increases obama 's chances of getting other nations—including japan , vietnam , canada , and mexico—to sign on , because they would n't have to fear later changes . a sign of the challenges supporters face : the afl-cio says it will spend six figures on ads going after 16 senators and 36 members of the house , reports the washington post . the group is worried about the loss of us jobs , but obama says the deal is necessary if america hopes to stay competitive against china .
