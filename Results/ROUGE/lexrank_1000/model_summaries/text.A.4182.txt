now we know why apple canned ios guru scott forstall : he refused to sign a letter apologizing for ios 6 's much-maligned map app , sources tell the wall street journal—a letter that ceo tim cook wound up signing himself . forstall was close with steve jobs , and indeed was once considered a potential successor , but he had a contentious relationship with other apple executives . forstall had recently been heard complaining that apple had no " decider " without jobs . chief designer jonathan ive reportedly refused to sit in on meetings with forstall unless cook was there to referee , according to computerworld . ive , interestingly enough , will be taking over forstall 's responsibilities—which , harry mccracken at time writes , could make him " the most important person at apple . " yesterday 's other departure , retail chief john browett , was asked to leave as well , sources say , though in his case it was simply because he had n't fit in at the company , and had botched the implementation of a new staffing formula .
