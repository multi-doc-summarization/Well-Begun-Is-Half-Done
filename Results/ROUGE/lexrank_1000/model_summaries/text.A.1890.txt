george takei is usually the one doling out criticism for those who step out of line on matters of race or equality . this time , he 's the one catching flak from critics . it 's over an interview the actor gave to fox 10 phoenix in which he called justice clarence thomas a " clown in blackface . " takei , a gay-rights advocate , lit into thomas because of his dissent in the supreme court 's gay marriage ruling . yesterday , takei posted a message on facebook addressing those who think he went too far , thought he did n't actually back down . he explains the theatrical origins of blackface as a white actor portraying a " black buffoon " and adds : " in traditional theater lingo , and in my view and intent , that is not racist . it is instead part of a racist history in this country . " then he goes after thomas anew , saying he " has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings . " thomas " made a similar remark about the japanese american internment , of which i am a survivor , " writes takei , who thinks that " a sitting justice of the supreme court ought to know better . " he 's still catching flak , though . " where in the world does george freaking takei get off deciding that he â€™ s the new arbiter of american blackness ? " asks sean davis at the federalist . and at mediaite , alex griswold has a scathing critique that , among other things , describes takei 's it's-not-racist explanation as " literally nonsense . i honestly do n't even know what he 's getting at . "
