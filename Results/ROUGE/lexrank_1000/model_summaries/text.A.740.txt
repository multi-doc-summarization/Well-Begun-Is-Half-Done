a 25-year-old german skier survived an avalanche that buried him without oxygen for 15 minutes , thanks in no small part to his paramedic ski buddy , who rescued him and started cpr immediately . but the lack of oxygen to his body tissues and brain ( called hypoxia ) took a toll , notes live science , and university of munich researchers report in jama neurology that it manifested in a quite unusual side effect . first , he developed muscle jerks brought on by walking and talking , and at one point in the hospital he started a sudoku puzzle , and the muscles in his left arm—which was not injured—began to spasm in what the doctors called " clonic " seizures , reports cbs news . " we can look at the brain as a network system , " says mayo clinic neurologist dr. elson so , who was not involved in the research . " there are some centers for mathematical concepts and others for language . the authors have shown with some evidence that the fibers connecting the centers were damaged . " thanks to this damage , the fibers that control excitation for mathematical concepts and 3d thinking were essentially hyper-activated , and because the patient visualized solutions to sudoku puzzles in 3d , the activity triggered epilepsy . five years later , physical therapy improved the twitches brought on by walking and talking , and he 's steered clear of seizures altogether thanks to epilepsy meds—and avoiding sudoku completely . ( epilepsy may have fueled chopin 's hallucinations . )
