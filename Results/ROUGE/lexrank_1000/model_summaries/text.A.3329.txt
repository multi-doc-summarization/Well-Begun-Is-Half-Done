spending time in new york city these days ? you might peek under the table or bench you 're using to see if there 's a tape recorder marked " property of nsa " —which was placed there by anti-nsa activists trying to make a point , the guardian reports . the activists wo n't identify themselves , but have posted recordings ( which they claim are authentic ) on wearealwayslistening.com . some are kinda embarrassing , too , like the students who brag about tricking a roommate into leaving , the asian men who mock other asians for speaking in an asian manner , or the guy whose gay lover liked acting out fight scenes as part of sex . it was " like batman returns , " he says . " bam ! boom ! kazam . ah you got me ! ” the point , of course , is political : anyone upset by the tapes can send " their feelings towards their government representatives to respond to the nsa 's tactics , " one of the activists tells the cbc . some nsa supporters have said they approve of domestic surveillance because they 're not doing anything wrong , he notes , and suggests these recordings will put that to the test . their website links the word " angry ? " to an aclu page where people can oppose the renewal of the patriot act , which is due to end june 1 , wired reports . for the record : what the activists are doing violates state law , and the aclu says it is n't affiliated with them , but did allow the link . meanwhile , " careful what you say in public , new yorkers—unless , of course , you have nothing to hide , " says wired .
