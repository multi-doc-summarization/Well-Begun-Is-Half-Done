controversy keeps swirling around h & m and an online ad that showed a young black boy in a hoodie with the words " coolest monkey in the jungle . " the ad has since been removed , but the family of 5-year-old liam mango , the ad 's model , now says they had to move out of their home in sweden for " security reasons , " liam 's mom , terry mango , tells the bbc . mango did n't get too much into those reasons for vacating their stockholm residence , but she did mention violent protests in south african h & m stores as a factor . mango has come under fire herself for her reaction to the ad : the new york post reports on a series of now-deleted facebook posts in which she said she did n't think the ad was racist and told people to stop " crying wolf " over this " unnecessary issue " and to " get over it . " she elaborated to the bbc that " i know racism exists , but does the shirt to me speak racism ? no it does n't . " mango and liam 's dad , frank odhiambo , appeared on a swedish morning show this week , where mango says she was once called a monkey herself on a cruise ship and understands why some might be upset about the ad , per newsweek . odhiambo says they had to move because they " have an obligation to protect our children , " the independent reports . the one person kept out of the fray so far : little liam himself . " he has no idea what 's going on , he 's only 5 , " mango tells the bbc , adding that he " has not experienced [ racism yet ] . " meanwhile , h & m , which was criticized for its first brief apology , has issued a second , lengthier one , per quartz . " we agree with all the criticism that this has generatedâ€”we have got this wrong and we agree that , even if unintentional , passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists , " it reads .
