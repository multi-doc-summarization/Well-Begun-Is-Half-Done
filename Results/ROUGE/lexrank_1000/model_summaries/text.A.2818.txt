medical firm founder roger williams owned private planes , flashy cars , and a yacht dubbed " spare change " ; he had courtside seats to see the lakers and enjoyed spending thousands at strip clubs . but an investigation by the center for investigative reporting suggests his $ 18-million-a-year california company , spinal solutions , made its money in part through counterfeiting expensive screws used in spinal surgeries and then distributing the knockoff screws to surgeons . williams allegedly wooed doctors via lavish vacations , lakers seats , and containers full of cash . there 's no evidence doctors were complicit in the reported counterfeiting , but plenty of them used the screws . a machinist , now 85 , tells cir that he made copies of screws for the company for $ 65 each , which is about half of their typical price—and far , far less than the $ 12,500 hospitals once billed for them . other companies ' logos were also falsified on the screws . a whistleblower finally told the fda about the alleged counterfeiting in 2011 , but the company was allowed to continue operation until debts ruined it in 2013 . the losers in all this , of course , were the patients , who could face dangers thanks to the substandard equipment . " this has been terrible , worst thing that ’ s ever happened to me … not knowing if the stuff still in me they couldn ’ t get out will one day kill me , " says one patient . as of last month , 32 lawsuits sought to address the matter , cbs 2 reports ; one has more than 20 plaintiffs . ( in happier spinal news , a paralyzed man 's nose helped him to walk again . )
