attempted suicides , drug overdoses , cutting , and other types of self-injury have increased substantially in us girls , a 15-year study of er visits found . it 's unclear why , but some mental health experts think cyberbullying , substance abuse , and economic stress from the recent recession might be contributing , the ap reports . the sharpest increase occurred among girls aged 10 to 14 , nearly tripling from 2009 to 2015 , from about 110 visits per 100,000 to almost 318 . older teen girls had the highest ratesâ€”633 visits per 100,000 in 2015 , but the increase after 2008 was less steep . the rising rates " should be of concern to parents , teachers , and pediatricians , " says dr. mark olfson , a psychiatry professor not involved in the cdc study published in jama . " one important reason to focus on reducing self-harm is that it is [ a ] key risk factor for suicide . " researchers analyzed 2001-2015 data on nonfatal self-inflicted injuries treated in ers among ages 10 to 24 . nearly 29,000 girls with self-inflicted injuries and about 14,000 boys were treated in ers during the study years . rates among boys did n't change much ; rates in girls were stable until around 2008 . the results underestimate the problem , though , since they do n't include self-injuries treated in doctors ' offices or elsewhere , says lead author melissa mercado . drug overdoses and other self-poisonings were the most common method for all , followed by intentional cutting with sharp objects . all injuries were intentional , but not all were suicide attempts , says mercado .
