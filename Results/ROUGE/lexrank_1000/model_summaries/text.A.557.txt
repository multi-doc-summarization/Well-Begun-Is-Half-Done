a new discovery has revived an old theory about ocean water gobbling up ships in the bermuda triangleâ€”if , that is , the bermuda triangle even exists . researchers from the arctic university of norway say they 've spotted large craters apparently created by methane buildups off norway 's coast , atlas obscura reports . " multiple giant craters exist on the sea floor in an area in the west-central barents sea ... and are probably a cause of enormous blowouts of gas , " they tell the sunday times . " the crater area is likely to represent one of the largest hotspots for shallow marine methane release in the arctic . " other experts have said gas blowouts from such craters , which measure 150 feet deep and up to a half-mile wide in norway , could explain the sinking of ships in a region between puerto rico , miami , and bermuda dubbed the bermuda triangle . " there is a version that the bermuda triangle is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions , " russian scientist igor yeltsov said last year , per the new zealand herald . ice-like underwater methane can break away and form gas that bubbles to the surface , live science explained in 2014 ; yeltsov says it erupts " like a nuclear reaction , producing huge amounts of gas . " research has shown that such eruptions could sink sea vessels , as nbc news reported in 2003 , and this youtube video appears to confirm that . but it 's not clear these blowouts even occur in the bermuda triangle , the guardian notes . and skeptics say the gulf stream 's many tropical storms would better account for the triangle 's lost ships and planes . the very term " bermuda triangle " is questionable : still dismissed by the us navy , it was invented in a dramatic 1964 article that probed the " mysterious menace " behind ships and airplanes lost in the area .
