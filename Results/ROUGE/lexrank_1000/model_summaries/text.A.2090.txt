a massive cleanup effort has been ordered on a quietly devastating oil spill that 's been contaminating the gulf of mexico for 14 years . the washington post reports the us coast guard has mandated taylor energy " institute a … system to capture , contain , or remove oil " from the affected site off the louisiana coast , infused with up to 30,000 gallons ( about 700 barrels ) of oil a day since hurricane ivan destroyed a company oil platform in 2004 , per doj estimates . contractors commissioned by taylor energy had previously said the oil spill was minimal , at the most around 2,000 gallons a day . if the company does n't comply with the coast guard 's new decree , it could be hit with a fine of up to $ 40,000 per day . to put it in context , the bp deepwater horizon spill dumped 4 million barrels of oil into the gulf before it was capped after 87 days in july 2010 ; the taylor spill could be at 3.5 million barrels . the taylor spill remained hidden from the public by both the company and the coast guard for six years after the hurricane . it was discovered only when nonprofits and environmental groups investigating the bp spill came upon oil slicks that did n't appear to be related to that particular incident . taylor energy—which contends the oil " sheens " on the surface of the water are n't from leaking wells , but from oil and gas floating up from the oil-heavy seafloor—says full containment of the leak could cost more than $ 1 billion , the times-picayune reports . still , " the time to clean this up was 14 years ago , " a rep for the gulf restoration network says . " taylor energy has shown nothing but negligence all this time . " ( the largest tanker oil spill in three decades happened earlier this year . )
