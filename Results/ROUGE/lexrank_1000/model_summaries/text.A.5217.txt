the environmental protection agency is stuck in what insiders call a " holding pattern " after a trump administration order that freezes all epa grants and contracts . " new epa administration has asked that all contract and grant awards be temporarily suspended , effective immediately , ” an email obtained by the washington post states . " please construe this to include task orders and work assignments , " states the email , which was sent on friday , within hours of trump 's swearing in . the email says the agency hopes to receive more clarification soon on the order , which could affect everything from climate research and education to waste handling and water testing . trump has nominated longtime epa critic scott pruit to run the agency . myron ebell , the prominent climate skeptic who ran the epa transition for the trump team , tells propublica that the move is n't unusual , though it may be wider than what previous administrations have done . " they 're trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don ’ t want to have happen , so any regulations going forward , contracts , grants , hires , they want to make sure to look at them first , " he says . a source tells the huffington post that epa staffers have been ordered not to discuss the freeze with anybody outside the agency . there also has been a freeze on epa press releases and social media postings , according to a memo obtained by the huffpo . ( on monday , trump brought in a federal hiring freeze . )
