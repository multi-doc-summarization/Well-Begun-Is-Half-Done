president obama 's next executive action may be to expand background checks for some gun buyersâ€”based on whom they 're buying from . obama , who reacted with emotion to the mass shooting at umpqua community college and will visit roseburg , ore. , on friday , is " seriously considering " new rules that would force private high-volume dealers to perform background checks on potential buyers , according to the washington post . private dealers who sell a certain number of guns each year would also need to get a license . nine days before the umpqua shooting , gun-control activists gabrielle giffords and her husband , mark kelly , visited the white house to repeat their desire to see just such a rule put in place . officials considered targeting dealers who sell at least 50 guns a year back in 2013 , but the plan was ultimately put on ice . the proposed rule change would clarify the federal statute , which notes anyone " engaged in the business " of dealing firearms needs to obtain a federal license and conduct background checks , except anyone " who makes occasional sales , exchanges , or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby , or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms . " earlier this week , hillary clinton said she would take executive action to change the definition of a gun dealer if elected president , per the post . a rep for the nra , however , says the proposed change would " ensnare " a widow selling off her late husband 's gun collection , for example . " people who repeatedly sell large volumes of firearms are already covered in the current statute , " she says .
