trump attorney rudy giuliani has been haggling with robert mueller about the idea of the president sitting down for an interview , and giuliani had hoped to have the issue resolved by sept. 1 . that 's looking increasingly unlikely now because giuliani tells cnn he has n't heard from mueller 's team in about three weeks . the last communication between the two sides is when trump 's lawyers sent their latest counter-offer about the interview on aug. 8 . since then , radio silence . " i figured we would n't hear until after the manafort trial , but we ( still ) have n't , " says giuliani . " i have to figure they 're planning something . " giuliani professes to have no idea what that might be , suggesting that mueller might be preparing to issue a subpoena or publish his report , or that the special counsel is simply content to wait until after the midterms to resume negotiations . as giuliani waits for a response , another member of trump 's inner circle—roger stone—predicts that mueller " is coming for me , " reports the hill . stone is so sure of it that he sent an email to supporters requesting donations for his legal defense fund . " i ’ m next on the crooked special prosecutor ’ s hit list because i 've advised donald trump for the past 39 years , " he wrote . stone further tells the guardian that mueller " may frame me for some bogus charge in order to silence me or induce me to testify against the president . " the newspaper notes one potential area of interest : stone has acknowledged exchanging messages during the campaign with " guccifer 2.0 , " and mueller thinks guccifer was actually a front for russian operatives who stole emails from top democrats then leaked them .
