in what discover calls a " unique and touching paper " published in the journal neurology thursday , robin williams ' widow shares the heartbreaking story of her husband 's final 10 months and asks neurologists not to give up in their quest toward brain disease cures . susan schneider williams refers to lewy body disease , the neurodegenerative disorder that ultimately led to williams ' suicide in august 2014 , as " the terrorist inside my husband 's brain . " she describes how , toward the end of his life , " robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it . " he was struggling with paranoia , anxiety , delusions , insomnia , and other symptoms both physical and mental , and for months , he and his wife could get no answers about what was happening to him . he was ultimately diagnosed with parkinson 's disease , but as his symptoms continued to worsen , he grew " weary " and it felt like they were both " drowning . " then , ultimately , he took his own life . it was only after his death that an autopsy revealed williams actually had lewy body diseaseâ€”his clinical symptoms mirrored parkinson 's , but his brain pathology showed that almost all of the neurons throughout his brain and brainstem had been besieged by lewy bodies , schneider williams writes . when she found out , she was n't surprised : " the mere fact that something had invaded nearly every region of my husband 's brain made perfect sense to me , " she writes . she has spent the time since williams ' death learning all she can about lewy body disease , for which there is no cure , and she now serves on the board of directors for the american brain foundation . her full piece is worth a read .
