the backlash over colin kaepernick 's appearance in nike 's latest ad campaign continues : now president trump has weighed in . " i think it ’ s a terrible message , " trump tells the daily caller . " i think it ’ s a terrible message that they ’ re sending and the purpose of them doing it , maybe there ’ s a reason for them doing it , but i think as far as sending a message , i think it ’ s a terrible message and a message that shouldn ’ t be sent . there ’ s no reason for it . " the ad features kaepernick , who started the controversial nfl anthem protests and who is now accusing nfl owners of colluding to keep him off any team 's roster , overlaid with the message , " believe in something . even if it means sacrificing everything . " trump conceded , though , " as much as i disagree with the colin kaepernick endorsement , in another way—i mean , i wouldn ’ t have done it . in another way , [ but ] it is what this country is all about , that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn ’ t do , but i personally am on a different side of it . " trump also noted " nike is a tenant of mine . they pay a lot of rent , " referring to niketown new york at 6 east 57th street in new york city . meanwhile , the ap reports that in the league 's first statement since nike announced the ad campaign , an nfl exec says the social justice issues raised by kaepernick and other players " deserve our attention and action " and that the league supports players promoting " meaningful , positive change in our communities .
