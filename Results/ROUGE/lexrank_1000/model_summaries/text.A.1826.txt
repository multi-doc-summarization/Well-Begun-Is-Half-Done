earlier this month , puerto rico announced its first death from guillain-barre syndrome , a condition causing temporary paralysis that , in this case , was linked to the zika virus . now incidences of guillain-barre are said to have risen in seven countries in tandem with outbreaks of zika , per a study in the new england journal of medicine . the new york times notes that while the cdc remains wary of saying zika can cause gbs ( it simply says gbs is " strongly associated " with zika ) , this research offers further evidence that zika may indeed be responsible—worrisome news , as about 500 million people in latin america and the caribbean are vulnerable to becoming infected with it . " it 's pretty obvious that in all seven sites there is a clear relationship , " says lead author dr. marcos a. espinal of the pan american health organization . the study found nearly 165,000 cases of zika virus ( some confirmed , some suspected ) between april 2015 and march 2016 , as well as almost 1,500 cases of gbs , reported in the brazilian state of bahia , colombia , the dominican republic , el salvador , honduras , suriname , and venezuela . during the weeks of zika outbreaks in these areas , the incidence of gbs cases spiked compared to pre-zika baseline numbers—jumping as much as 877 % in venezuela . women had a 75 % higher reported incidence rate of zika than men , but men had a gbs incidence rate 28 % higher than women 's , and incidence rates also climbed with age , nbc news reports . ( the cdc 's zika funds are almost gone . )
