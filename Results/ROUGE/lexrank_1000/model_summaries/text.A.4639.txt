parents who thought they were going to have to sit through a boring graduation in a stuffy gym got anything but at portsmouth high school on friday . colin yost , the valedictorian for the new hampshire school 's senior class , decided he wanted to shake things up—and off—during his commencement speech , so after his words of inspiration , he stepped out from behind the podium and started dancing , by himself , to taylor swift 's " shake it off , " eliciting laughter and some " oh gosh , what is he doing ? " reactions , mtv reports . soon , however , his intentions were made clear as the rest of his graduating class ( more than 230 in all ) stood up and joined colin in a choreographed celebration of the end of their high school career . while colin 's flash mob surprised the audience , it was far from spontaneous . the senior posted a video tutorial on youtube for his classmates to study and cajoled the school 's administration beforehand into letting him use five graduation rehearsals to get the moves down just right , mtv notes . " as we practiced , the energy was just building and everyone was feeling how great it was to work together and send this positive message , " he tells the station . he adds that the song-and-dance show played perfectly into what he had talked about in his speech on embracing your inner nerd , the portsmouth herald notes . but despite the taylor-made two-stepping 's success , we probably wo n't be seeing colin—who admits he 's never taken a dance lesson—on so you think you can dance : he 's headed to princeton to study chemical and biological engineering , per mtv . ( hopefully no one got arrested for cheering . )
