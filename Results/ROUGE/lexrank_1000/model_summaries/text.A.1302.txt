at least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in uganda so far after state house uganda confirmed a man died this week of the marburg virusâ€”a type of hemorrhagic fever that 's strikingly similar to ebola , cnn reports . many of the individuals now in isolation are health workers , as the deceased was a radiographer in a kampala hospital and another health center and had contact with multiple colleagues . so far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for marburg , though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they 've developed do n't disappear . and those symptoms might sound familiar if you 've been following the ebola situation : both viruses are members of the filovirus family and manifest in similar ways , including fever , severe headache , and major bleeding , the washington post reports . although many of the outbreaks recorded since marburg was ided in 1967 have been single cases , the fatality rate ranges from 23 % to 90 % ( if you discount those single-case years ) , the cdc notes . perhaps to mitigate increasing concern over ebola after thomas duncan 's death in texas this week , cdc director thomas frieden has been talking up efforts the cdc has undertaken in uganda and emphasized that no further marburg cases have been documented . " that may not make headlines , but it does give us confidence that we can control ebola in west africa , " he says , per cnn . dr. ruhakana rugunda , uganda 's prime minister , seems to share frieden 's optimism , posting a series of tweets this week that indicate the country 's success rate and experience in dealing with hemorrhagic fevers .
