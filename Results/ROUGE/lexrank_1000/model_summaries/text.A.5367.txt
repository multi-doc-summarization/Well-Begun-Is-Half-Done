there 's at least one graffiti vigilante on the loose at columbia university . over the past week , lists have been appearing in bathrooms across the school 's campus , with titles like " rapists on campus " and " sexual assault violators on campus , " according to student media reports . the first list , reported by the lion , appeared to featured the handwriting of multiple people , though subsequent lists—featuring the same four names—appeared to be the work of one person . yesterday the campaign reached a new level , when two more graffiti lists were found and flyers describing the alleged wrongdoers were found in multiple stalls , according to bwog . the school has quickly scrubbed the graffiti each time it has been found—yesterday it reportedly began closing down bathrooms until it could be sure it had removed the lists . media outlets have so far blacked out all the names when posting photos of the list—bwog said that senior administrators had warned that publishing it would violate title ix—but jezebel reports that the list includes a musician , a varsity athlete , and a " prominent writer for a campus publication . " that publication may have been bwog ; the site posted a statement from its editors yesterday saying that a member of its staff had indeed been accused of violating the school 's gender based misconduct policy , and had agreed to resign .
