did the gorilla have to die ? the cincinnati zoo is facing an angry backlash for shooting harambe , an endangered gorilla , dead after a 4-year-old boy fell in its enclosure saturday , cnn reports . protesters who accuse the zoo of using excessive force gathered outside the zoo sunday and the # justiceforharambe movement has started a petition to have the boy 's parents investigated for negligence . the zoo , however , says that while it is devastated by the death of the male western lowland gorilla , the boy was in imminent danger and tranquilizers would not have worked quickly enough . a witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure , the gorilla seemed protective at first , but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat . a witness tells cnn that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted , the boy had to " climb under something , through some bushes and then into the moat . " he was released from a hospital on saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is " doing just fine , " the cincinnati enquirer reports . " we know that this was a very difficult decision for them , and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla , " they said . the bbc notes that a similar incident in britain in 1986 had a happier ending . when a 5-year-old boy fell into a gorilla enclosure on the island of jersey and fractured his skull , a male silverback named jambo stood guard , stroking the boy and keeping other gorillas away until he was rescued .
