amid sexual harassment allegations and an exodus of advertisers from the o'reilly factor , bill o'reilly is on vacationâ€”or , as the washington post puts it , on " vacation . " in a report that fox has refuted , new york 's gabriel sherman says several high-placed sources have told him that tuesday night 's show will be o'reilly 's last . sherman says his fox sources have told him that in a murdoch family split similar to the one that preceded the departure of roger ailes last year , fox ceo james murdoch wants o'reilly gone for good , while brother lachlan and father rupert murdoch want him to stay . sherman says lawyers who looked into ailes ' behavior are now taking a " deep dive " into list of allegations against o'reilly . mediaite notes that sherman 's sources have been spot-on about fox developments the past , though a fox spokesperson says o'reilly 's vacation was planned before the allegations surfaced and he will be back on the air april 24 . o'reilly said the same when he announced the vacation at the end of his show tuesday night , the ap reports . " we all need r & r , " said o'reilly , who told viewers he usually takes a break around this time of year and he booked this trip last fall . this year , the o'reilly factor has had its best viewing figures in its 20-year history , though around 60 companies have pulled ads from the show , which now only has about half as much advertising time as it did a few weeks ago , the post reports .
