researchers say they 've found another possible way to detect alzheimer 's , this time through a blood test that looks for antibodies . though still under development , a diagnostic kit could be available within the year , reports reuters . the catch : while scientists are getting better at detecting alzheimer 's with such discoveries , they still ca n't cure the disease . " it 's unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get alzheimer 's if they ca n't do anything about it , " says a scientist with the scripps research institute . " but i can say with some certainty that we will never get a good therapy for alzheimer 's without early diagnosis . " more details here on the science involved in the blood test , which could theoretically work on other diseases such as cancer .
