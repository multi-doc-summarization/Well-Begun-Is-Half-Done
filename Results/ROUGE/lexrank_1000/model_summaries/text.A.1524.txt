the minnesota teenager accused this week of planning a school massacre did n't just make a few offhand remarks . he laid out his plan in methodical detail in a notebook he kept locked inside his guitar case , and police are convinced that john david ladue was poised to strike within weeks , reports the minneapolis star tribune . the 17-year-old had a three-stage plan : he would kill his parents and sister at home with a .22-caliber rifle , go to a rural spot to start a fire and draw first-responders , and finally head to waseco high school to kill as many people as he could with guns and homemade bombs . he planned to be killed himself by police . “ ladue planned on setting off pipe bombs and throwing molotov cocktails down the main wing corridors in the school , and then shooting and killing students as they rushed out of the corridors , ” says the criminal affidavit , reports nbc news . police found an assault rifle with 400 rounds of ammo , a 9mm handgun , and at least a half-dozen bombs at the teen 's storage unit and home . when officers confronted him in the storage unit , they say he basically taunted them by making them guess what he was doing before answering any questions . when an officer guessed he was making bombs , the teen agreed to go to the station . the plot unraveled thanks to a 21-year-old who called police when she saw ladue cut through her yard on his way to the storage unit and then act suspiciously outside it . " the flowers i received today—they say , 'thank you , from a grateful parent , ' " chelsie schellhas tells nbc .
