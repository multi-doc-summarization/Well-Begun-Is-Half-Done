a police lieutenant in georgia who was recorded on video during a traffic stop saying " we only shoot black people " is being fired , the police chief said thursday . dashcam video from july 2016 shows a car stopped on the side of a road and a woman can be heard telling cobb county police lt. greg abbott she was scared to move her hands in order to get her cellphone . abbott , who is white , interrupts her and says , " but you 're not black . remember , we only shoot black people . yeah . we only shoot black people , right ? " announcing his decision to fire abbott , police chief mike register remarked that " there 's really no place for these types of comments in law enforcement , " the ap reports . " no matter what context you try to take those comments in , the statements were inexcusable and inappropriate . " register said he learned of the comments after television station wsb-tv obtained the video through an open-records request and made the department aware of it . abbott , who had been an officer for 28 years , was placed on administrative leave while the department investigated the video . the report from the internal review indicates that abbott was trying to be sarcastic and to address the situation as he perceived it , register said , continuing , " i do n't know what 's in his heart but i certainly know what came out of his mouth . it 's inexcusable . " the atlanta journal-constitution reports that as plans to fire abbott were being announced , abbott sent an email to the county saying he was retiring . commission chairman mike boyce told the paper he was n't sure how the email would affect the department 's plans .
