we get it , parents . you want the best for your kid . sometimes , that means feeding them nutritious food , reading to them , and being there for them . and sometimes , it means buying them a $ 6.5 million high-rise apartment in a city on the other side of the planet . that 's what one chinese mother did recently , a top new york city real estate executive told a chinese tv station , in a story spotted by time . when he asked her why she was apartment-shopping , " she said , well , her daughter was going to go to columbia , or nyu , or maybe harvard , and so she needed to be in the center of the city , " says the agent . " so i said , 'oh , how old is your daughter ? ' and she said , 'well , she 's 2 . ' " the move might actually be financially savvy—the apartment 's value is already up to $ 8.9 million—although someone should really tell her that harvard is in boston . chinese social media is already abuzz with speculation that the anonymous buyer might be tied to a corrupt government official .
