a group of friends enjoying a morning in nyc 's central park stumbled onto misfortune sunday when one apparently stepped on an explosive , severely injuring his leg , the new york post reports . the fdny says the explosion happened around 11am at 68th street and fifth avenue , per nbc new york , and a senior law enforcement official tells the station a bag of fireworks was found near the scene , though it 's not clear it was a firework that caused the explosion . the post ids the 18-year-old who was injured as conner golden , who was climbing on rocks in the park with some other pals , all said to be visiting from the dc area . golden was whisked to bellevue hospital and is currently undergoing surgery , with sources saying an amputation looks likely . 1010 wins reports golden is in critical but stable condition , via cbs new york . according to john murphy , another visitor to the park who came upon the scene , it looked like golden 's foot was missing below the ankle . " his left leg was severely damaged , all bone and muscle , " he says . " he was in shock . i do n't think he even realized what had happened . " cops are trying to determine if the explosion , which witnesses tell the post could be heard from outside where elie wiesel 's funeral was being held , was caused by a firework or what the post calls a " more sinister " device , and if the dc buddies were the ones who may have brought fireworks into the park . " i said , 'come on , guys , were you carrying fireworks ? ' " murphy says . " and they said no . and i believed them . â€¦ this was n't an m80 or a cherry bomb . [ this was ] something much more serious . " nbc notes that section of the park was cordoned off , but the park was n't evacuated or closed due to the incident .
