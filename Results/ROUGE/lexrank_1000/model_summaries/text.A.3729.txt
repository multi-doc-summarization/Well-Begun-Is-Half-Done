alexander haig died this morning at age 85 . the former four-star general served as white house chief of staff during the tumultuous final months of the nixon administration—he kept the place running and guided nixon toward a peaceful resignation , reports the washington post—and he ran for the top office himself in 1988 . but he 's perhaps best known to americans as ronald reagan 's secretary of state , who incorrectly told the nation " i am in control here " after reagan got shot . another former reagan aide , lyn nofgizer , said haig knew that despite all his accomplishments , the third paragraph of his obituary would harp on that , notes the new york times—in the third paragraph of its obituary . prior to the news conference in which he made the declaration , haig told fellow cabinet members that the " helm is right here , and that means in this chair for now , constitutionally , until the vice president gets here . " the constitution , of course , disagrees , and haig 's words forever earned him the reputation as being hungry for power .
