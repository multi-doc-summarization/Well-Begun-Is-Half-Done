how does one truly understand david bowie ? only by becoming him , of course . that 's just what will brooker is in the midst of doing . the film and cultural studies professor from kingston university in england says he 'll dress like bowie , eat like bowie , watch the same movies and read the same books as bowie , and act like bowie 's various personas over the course of a year , all in the name of research for a book he 's writing on the pop icon , reports the guardian . " the idea is to inhabit bowie 's headspace at points in his life and career to understand his work from an original angle , while retaining a critical and objective perspective at the same time , " brooker says . he last month told australia 's abc news in a video interview he started the project as " 1965 bowie " ; he has lately emulated bowie 's 1974 philadelphia soul period . he 'll suffer from a lack of sleep but avoid cocaine . " the levels of cocaine bowie was consuming is not just illegal for a professor like myself , but it 's much too expensiveâ€”as well as unhealthy , " brooker says . " i had a six-pack of energy drinks to try and simulate the experience , " he adds . " it made me very jumpy . " he 'll also likely avoid " a fling with mick jagger , " he says , per rolling stone . but he consumed only red peppers and milk for a time and has visited cities linked to the singer . the project is likely to be anything but boring , but a year as the icon will be more than enough . bowie 's head can be a " strange " and " dangerous " place , " a place you would n't want to live too long , " brooker says . next up : 1983 . " i think i 'll get a tan , get fit , get my hair changed again , get my teeth whitened , " he says . there 's a bright yellow suit waiting in his closet . ( perhaps he 'll visit this dying bowie-linked town . )
