anthropologists who have been working to locate and identify the remains of the boys who died at a notorious florida reform school traveled to philadelphia this week , hoping to get answers in the death of yet another student . but when they exhumed thomas curry 's casket tuesday , they found that instead of a body , it held only planks of wood , cnn reports . curry escaped 29 days after arriving at arthur g. dozier school for boys in 1925 . the school 's ledger describes him as being killed on a railroad bridge ; a death certificate found in 2008 revealed the teen 's skull was " crushed from an unknown cause . " his body was supposedly returned to his family , and they buried what they thought was thomas in the same philadelphia plot where his great-grandparents lay . thomas , believed to be either 15 or 17 , was one of the 100 boys who died at the marianna school between 1900 and 1952 ; about half were buried on the grounds , but the rest were—at least supposedly—returned to their families . " something was shipped up from florida , and it was buried , and someone believed it was thomas curry , " the pennsylvania state police officer who helped get the casket exhumed tells the philadelphia inquirer , adding that he " absolutely " sees the casket as another of the school 's " efforts to deceive , coverups . " says the lead anthropologist on the case , " what we have is more questions than answers . " a cousin provided dna to help identify thomas , so the team will now attempt to match it to one of the bodies dug up on the former campus—whose former occupants told stories of sexual abuse , being locked in sweat boxes or hog-tied , and , writes the inquirer , " hunted down when they ran .
