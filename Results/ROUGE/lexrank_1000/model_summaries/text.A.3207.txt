rachel borch was out for a jog in the woods near her home in hope , maine , when a " ferocious-looking " attacker with beady eyes and tiny teeth made a beeline for her , reports the camden herald . borch , 21 , knew immediately that something was wrong with the raccoon that was charging toward her . " imagine the tasmanian devil , " she tells the bangor daily news of the " terrifying " june 3 incident . yanking out her headphones , she began " dancing " around the animal on the narrow path , but she tells the herald she knew that , one way or another , the animal was going to bite her . she figured her hands would be the best spot , so she offered them up . the raccoon chomped down on her thumb and stayed there , scratching at her legs and arms as she screamed . now on her knees , she spotted her phone lying submerged in a mud puddle , and had an idea : drown it . " with my thumb in its mouth , i just pushed its head down into the muck , " she tells the news . when the raccoon finally stopped moving , she yanked out her finger and raced the three-quarters of a mile home . two days later , the state confirmed the animal was infected with rabies . borch got rabies shots , and an animal control officer adds an unpleasant footnote : the infected raccoon may not be alone . " not to scare people , " heidi blood tells the news , but " when there ’ s one , there ’ s typically another . " ( normally nocturnal like raccoons , a crazed beaver attacked a woman paddle-boarder . )
