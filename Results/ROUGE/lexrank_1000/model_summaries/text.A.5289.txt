sorry , twinkies fans : hostess really is shutting its doors . the company threatened to do so yesterday if striking workers did not return by the end of the day . apparently they did n't , because cnn reports that the twinkies maker is now asking a federal bankruptcy court for permission to go out of business . that will mean 18,500 employees will lose their jobs , but cnn notes that ding dongs and other popular items could still survive under another brand , as hostess will be selling its assets at auction . slate reminds us that hostess has gone bankrupt before ; that time around , mexico 's bimbo bakeries tried to nab it . maybe they 'll try againâ€”although , writes matthew yglesias , " the company 's various packaged snack cakes are cultural icons , but also pretty unfashionable in the era of artisanal cupcakes . " wonder bread , too , has suffered as customers gravitate toward healthier options like multigrain bread . ( click to see why one food writer fervently believes it 's time for the twinkie to die . )
