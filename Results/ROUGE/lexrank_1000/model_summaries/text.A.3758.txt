since president trump announced thursday he was pulling the us out of the paris climate agreement , france has been relentlessly dragging the white house . cnn reports the dragging now includes the french government tweeting a remixed version of a white house video on the agreement friday . the new version of the video , created by the french ministry for europe and foreign affairs , pencils in corrections to the original . for example , the white house 's video claims the agreement was a " bad deal for the us " ; it was changed to say leaving the agreement is the bad deal . the edited video also points out that companies like microsoft and exxon mobil think the paris agreement is good for the us economy and that the deal was " comprehensively " —not " badly " —negotiated by former president obama , according to the hill . the video comes after new french president emmanuel macron tweaked trump by pledging to " make the planet great again " and reasserting american greatness despite trump 's actions . in a live broadcast in english , macron offered france as a " second homeland " for us climate scientists , as well as " all scientists , engineers , entrepreneurs , responsible citizens , " telling them , " come here and work with us , " the independent reports . " i wish to tell the united states , france believes in you—the world believes in you , " macron added .
