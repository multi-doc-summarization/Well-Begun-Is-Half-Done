emil skokan iii was every bit the doting father-to-be when his fiancee texted him to say she would soon undergo a c-section . " he said , 'do you need anything ? ' and that he would come up shortly and that he loved me , " crystal matrau-belt , 24 , tells abc news . " it was the last time i talked to him . " as skokan , 34 , rushed to bronson methodist hospital in kalamazoo , mich. , on saturday with matrau-belt 's mother , peggy nichols , he lost control of his vehicle and hit a tree , reports mlive . both skokan and nichols , 53 , were killed ; police say speed was a factor . other family members , including matrau-belt 's stepmother , helped her welcome a baby boy , jeremiah , before breaking the news . " to have a child but then have two things ripped out of my life , it 's just really hard to deal with and even process , " the new mom says . " it 's like happy and the most heartbreaking thing . " matrau-belt says both her fiance and mom were so excited to meet jeremiah . " their main focus was being able to be here because i did n't want them to miss anything , " she says . while nichols " had big plans to take him to the zoo , to disney world , " skokan had spent the previous day readying the couple 's house for jeremiah 's arrival . he " was trying to do everything right , " says matrau-belt . " he wanted to step up and make sure he was a good father to him . " she now takes solace in seeing skokan in jeremiah . " i see emil in him , " particularly when " he gives this wrinkled up nose look " when he 's annoyed . " just to know that i have a piece of emil , that helps a little bit . " matrau-belt says she does n't " really know what to do with myself , " but she wants to tell others to appreciate what they have . " you 've got to be able to slow down and look at every part of life and cherish it . " ( two brothers had babies on the same day , at the same hospital . )
