the tiniest thing in the universe is not a grain of sand , as people once thought , nor a proton or neutron , or even a quark or electronâ€”as small as they all are . in fact , experts today balk at naming any point-like object " the smallest " because of a theoretical conundrum : when you 're infinitely near any point , the forces that act on it turn infinitely huge . hoping to duck the whole " infinite " thing , scientists have invented novel theories around it , physicist andy parker tells space.com . among the work-arounds : superstring theory , which posits that particles are like loopy strings rather than points . this would enable scientists to get infinitely close to something but always remain further from another part of it . " space-time foam , " the theory that space is made of pixels or grains . this would keeps particles from being infinitely close to each other , because the grain create a natural distance . one candidate for " smallest " that parker discounts is black hole singularities , although he concedes that " they are maybe a million million times or even more than that smaller than the distances we 've seen so far . " see excerpts of parker 's bbc show on the subject .
