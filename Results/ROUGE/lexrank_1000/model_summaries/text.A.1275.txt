when germany invaded norway in 1940 , nazi leader heinrich himmler endorsed the concept of german soldiers hooking up with norwegian women , as that would help bring the nazis closer to the aryan master race they wished for . per the bbc , about 50,000 norwegian women ended up in relationships with the germans , and they became known as the " german girls " â€”a label that led to harsh punishments after wwii ended when their country turned on them for what was viewed as a betrayal . now , norway 's prime minister is officially offering an apology to those women , calling them " victims of undignified treatment " and noting that norwegian authorities back then acted outside of usual conventions in punishing these women and the children they bore .

" [ the women 's ] only crime was breaking the unwritten rules , " he says . ( as one woman headed to the auschwitz gas chamber , she wrote this . )
