president obama today cast the budget fight today as a choice between jet owners and ordinary americans at his press conference . some reactions : greg sargent , washington post : " he was clearly out to pick a major public fight with republicans over tax cuts for the rich . obama mounted a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high end tax cuts , casting it as a test of our society ’ s priorities , and argued—crucially—that anyone who fails to support ending them is fundamentally unserious about the deficit . " larry kudlow , national review : " basically his message today was class-warfare , soak-the-rich . somehow , democrats are for your kids but republicans are for your fat cats . it ’ s so tiresome . it will never sell . " steve benen , washington monthly : obama " did a very effective job at putting republicans in a box . either policymakers accept a balance approach , obama argued , or the gop will be exposed as deficit frauds who care about protecting the rich at the expense of everyone else . " robert frank , wall street journal : " obama has a new term for the people he wants to tax more : jet owners . ... the problem is that most of the people that would be subject to the higher taxes the president wants aren ’ t likely to be private-jet owners . someone earning $ 250,000 a year—among those scheduled for a tax increase in 2012—is unlikely to afford a jet—or even a few charter trips on a jet .
