the tear-jerker christmas ad of the year has arrived from poland . the ad from auction website allegro shows an elderly man using the site to search for " english . " a package soon arrives on the man 's doorstep with learning materials titled , " english for beginners . " we watch as the man slowly begins to learn a few words , from " toilet " to " dog , " before picking up more—including a curse word—from english movies . soon , he 's loudly reciting phrases like " i love you " and " you are perfect " on a bus . why all the effort ? it soon becomes clear as the man packs his " toothbrush " and " passport " in a " suitcase " and boards a plane to england , where he visits his son for christmas . then a face peeks out from behind a door . the man approaches the little kid , crouches down , and says in perfect english , " hi . i am your grandpa . " a rep tells buzzfeed that the ad and allegro have the same goal : to " bring joy , touch the heart , and cause a [ smile ] . " in only a week , the ad has been watched more than 2.7 million times on youtube , and at least some viewers were left blubbering . " that was a beautiful ad ... i got tears in my eyes , " says a commenter , per the telegraph . " i 'm not crying . dust in my eye . you 're crying . shut up , " adds a twitter user . in a real-life equivalent , the huffington post reports a 75-year-old grandfather living in brazil joined instagram so he could share his daily drawings with his grandchildren , who live in the us and korea . he now has 151,000 followers .
