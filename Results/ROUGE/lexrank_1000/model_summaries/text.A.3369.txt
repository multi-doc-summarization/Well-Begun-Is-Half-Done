" i understand a business owner has a right to refuse service if he wants to , " reichardt wrote in his thursday post , which has since gone viral . " i also understand that as customers we all have the right to find some other restaurant to take our lunch break in . " but a slightly different story has emerged on komo , which says the owners of the restaurant , through an interpreter , are calling the entire incident a giant misunderstanding that was brought about by a language barrier . they say that during the deputies ' lunch , other customers became upset after some soup and water spilled ; a worker thought maybe it was because the deputies were nearby and asked the deputies if they were getting ready to leave . an employee then further misunderstood when the chief deputy called to confirm the story , the owners say . a video on q13 fox shows the restaurant 's owner breaking down while talking about the incident , and his son appears on camera to apologize for his lack of english skills ; the owners are also inviting law enforcement members to eat there for free on monday . the ap 's calls to the restaurant for comment were met with busy signals .
