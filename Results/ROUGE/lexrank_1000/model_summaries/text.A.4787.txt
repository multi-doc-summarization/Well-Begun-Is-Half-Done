weird : martha stewart has her own limited-edition flavor of triscuit crackers out this month . not so weird : that flavor is " toasted coconut and sea salt . " the huffington post calls it " the bougiest thing in the cracker aisle , " which is about what you 'd probably expect from stewart , but notes that it actually tastes pretty good . yahoo notes that the ingredients are " totally on trend , " and the week jokes that you 're probably required to serve the crackers " on a gleaming silver tray alongside waterford goblets and perfectly folded linen napkins . "
