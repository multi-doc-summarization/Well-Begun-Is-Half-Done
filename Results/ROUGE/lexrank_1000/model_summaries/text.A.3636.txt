no danger of this passenger experiencing an episode of nut rage : in what los angeles international airport says is an aviation first , a robot traveled as a paying passenger on monday , sitting in an economy-class seat of its own on a lufthansa flight to frankfurt , germany , reuters reports . " athena , " a us-made humanoid robot , was pushed through the airport in a wheelchair by two german researchers who plan to teach it to walk—and , eventually , to perform dangerous tasks like the nuclear cleanup at fukushima . for now , she ca n't do much more than move her arms . an airport spokeswoman says the red-sneaker-clad athena could have made the overseas voyage in a box , but the scientists " wanted to see how humans responded to a robot sitting in a plane . " it is fairly common for people with precious cargo to buy a plane seat for it , but " most of that equipment does n't have a humanoid face , " mashable notes . it does n't always get special perks , either : athena did n't have to submit to the metal detector ( she got a special pat-down ) and got to cut to the front of the boarding line—the first-class one at that .
