chicago police said charges could be announced soon in the fatal shooting of an illinois congressman 's grandson following an argument over a pair of basketball shoes , reports the ap . " first-degree murder charges are expected , " a police rep tells the chicago tribune . officer michelle tannehill said two juveniles are in custody and are considered suspects in the killing of 15-year-old javon wilson , who was shot in the head at his home in chicago on friday . javon is the grandson of longtime us rep. danny davis . police earlier said the shooting stemmed from a dispute over basketball shoes . javon knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point . davis said he was told that a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with javon 's 14-year-old brother , but thought better of the trade and went to javon 's house with a 17-year-old girl . he said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with javon before the boy pulled a gun and fired . " it 's almost , just the way it is . people think nothing of it , " davis said . " youngsters invariably say , ' i know a lot of guys who 've got guns . i know a lot of girls who 've got guns . ' it becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change . " davis , who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th congressional district , wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he 'd continue to try to combat gun violence . davis said his grandson was " a pretty regular kid " who loved playing basketball and knew all the pros and their stats , who also loved music and whose grades were improving after a rough patch . " the question becomes where does a 15-year-old obtain a gun ? who let the 15-year-old have a gun and under what circumstances ? " davis asked . " there 's no answer for that except that the availability of guns is so prevalent in america to the point where you almost ca n't tell who has a gun " anymore .
