" i was so stoked to be doing them . but maybe i hit it a little too hard . i couldn ’ t say no . there ’ s nothing wrong with them , but maybe i overloaded my audience . i should have done a superhero movie or a psychological thriller . " that 's when things changed for her . " this thing that was my best friend for a long time suddenly turned on me , " she says , referring to the biz . " and i didn ’ t expect it . i was taken by surprise and angry at it for betraying me .

' and shut down all the noise . " she 's back now , with a new tv show . ( speaking of movie romances , a shocking interview out yesterday revealed that ryan gosling wanted rachel mcadams kicked off the notebook set . )
