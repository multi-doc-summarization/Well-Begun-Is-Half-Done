gawker has stirred up a furor by posting an anonymous guy 's claim of a having a " one-night stand " ( which involved the same bed , but no sex ) with a drunk christine o'donnell a few years ago . on twitter and all over blog land , the story about the story has now eclipsed the actual story ( as evidenced by this summary ) . the huffington post 's roundup of reaction includes meghan mccain tweeting , " wow gawker , just wow . this is the exact reason why women do n't want to run for office in this country . posting that is vile and disgusting . " at yahoo 's upshot blog , michael calderone talks to gawker editor remy stern , who defends it as a " great story " and rejects the various charges of misogyny being leveled . " if it was any politician whose private life diverged from his public life in such an interesting way , we 'd be interested in that . it had nothing to do with her being a woman . " calderone also quotes a tweet from slate 's dave weigel : " hey gawker , i hope a one-day seo term victory is worth the sleaziest piece of s -- - story in memory . " michelle malkin , meanwhile , is calling out gawker 's advertisers over the " smear . "
