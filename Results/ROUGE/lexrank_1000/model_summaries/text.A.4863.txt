researchers say they 've found fossilized bacteria that may date back to shortly after the formation of the earth ( geologically speaking , anyway ) , the new york times reports . they published their findings wednesday in nature . the rocks were collected in 2008 from the nuvvuagittuq geological formation in canada . the rocks are estimated to have formed near a hydrothermal vent on the seafloor between 3.77 billion and 4.22 billion years ago . they contain tiny filaments and tubes , some connected by knobs , that resemble younger bacteria fossils created near hydrothermal vents . they also contain a level of carbon indicative of a living organism . if the fossils are what researchers say they are—and not everyone is convinced they are—they would push the date of earliest known life back billions of years . currently the oldest fossilized bacteria widely accepted as legitimate are 3.5 billion years old and come from australia , ars technica reports . and if these canadian fossils are closer to 4.22 billion years old , it means the bacteria would have been alive just 340 million years after the formation of the earth . still , every new claim of finding the world 's oldest fossilized life is met with skepticism , and this discovery is no different . one expert calls the rocks " dubiofossils , " fossil-like but not clearly evidence of an organism . in response , researchers argue there 's too much evidence in favor of their conclusion to ignore . ( this dinosaur fossil is one of the " saddest " ever found . )
