" it depends on your definition of terrorism . a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism , but it 's not linked to international terrorism , " says andrew cuomo , via cnn . the new york governor says there 's no evidence that an explosion that rocked a crowded manhattan neighborhood , injuring 29 people , had any link to international terrorism , reports the ap . cuomo spoke sunday morning near the site of the saturday night blast on west 23rd street in the chelsea neighborhood . cuomo noted that the device in manhattan appeared to be different than a pipe bomb explosion earlier saturday in new jersey and said he did n't believe the two were connected . authorities found a second device in manhattan a few blocks away from the one that exploded and removed it . cuomo says the injured have been released from the hospital , and that given the scope of the damage " we were really lucky that there were no fatalities . " most of the injuries were minor . the democratic governor also said that 1,000 additional national guard troops were being deployed " just to err on the side of caution . i want new yorkers to be confident when they go back to work on monday that new york is up and running and we 're doing everything that we need to do .
