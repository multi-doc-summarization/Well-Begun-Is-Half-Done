sometimes dogs save humans , sometimes humans save dogs . the latter was the case in canada last week when a man punched a cougar that had a death grip on his 80-pound husky 's neck , reports reuters . will gibb , a 31-year-old technician from red deer , had pulled up to a tim hortons for coffee and let his dogs sasha and mongo out of his truck for a quick run around the parking lot , according to the royal canadian mounted police . when he heard sasha yelping in pain seconds later , he " went running " to save her , he tells the cbc . but it was n't until he " punched it in the side of the head " that he saw the animal was a cougar . ( sightings are common but attacks rare , says an rcmp deputy . ) the cat ran into the woods , but the punch proved insufficient . as gibb tried to pick up sasha 's twitching body , the apparently confused dog bit him and the cougar reemerged , so he had to throw punches with his right arm while trying to protect his dog and his hurt left arm . " she was fighting for her life , " gibb says of sasha , who ran to safety . when the cougar went for mongo , gibb grabbed a big stick and got in its way before chasing it off into the woods again . with a vet clinic just a block away , sasha was tended to quickly , while local police found and killed the cougar . the vet says sasha had to be sewn up in her chest and had deep bites around her neck , but she survived thanks to her owner . ( and you thought the guy who punched a kangaroo was brave . )
