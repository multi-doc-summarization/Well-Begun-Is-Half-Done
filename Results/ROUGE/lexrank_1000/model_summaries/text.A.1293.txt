the 20th anniversary of jonbenet ramsey 's murder has led to all kinds of renewed speculation about the case , but now comes an actual development in the criminal investigation : the state plans to conduct new dna tests on the panties and long johns the 6-year-old was wearing when she was killed on or after christmas night 1996 , reports the daily camera and 9news . a previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former district attorney mary lacy erred when she exonerated members of the ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier dna tests . lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl , but outside forensic experts have since disputed that , asserting that the dna was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as " unknown male 1 . " " if you 're looking for someone that does n't exist , because actually it 's several people , it 's a problem , " explained a former us attorney for colorado . the new , more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right . they could also reveal the dna is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer , and merely the result of " inconsequential contact with other people , " per the camera . one of the most high-profile anniversary stories about the case came via cbs , whose expert panel concluded that jonbenet 's brother , burke , killed his sister . burke has since sued , but the forensic pathologist he 's going after argued in court documents this month that his view on the case was mere " speculation " about " one of the major unsolved crimes " of the 20th century and thus should be protected speech , reports people . no word on when the new dna tests will be conducted . ( burke also talked to dr . phil . )
