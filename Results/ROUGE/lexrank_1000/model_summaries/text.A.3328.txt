no word on whether they kept garlic or a crucifix nearby as they dug , but polish archaeologists say they 've unearthed four " vampire " skeletons . the remains were found with the head placed between their legs ; folk tradition held that this burial arrangement would ensure that a possible bloodsucker could n't find his head and come back to life . though an archaeologist tells polskie radio that " it 's very difficult to tell when these burials were carried out " due to their lack of jewelry or other items that could be dated , they likely occurred long before 1914â€”the date of the last recorded " vampire " burial in the country . the skeletons were found on a construction site near gliwice , in southern poland , and tests are being conducted on the remains . the telegraph goes into greater ( and gorier ) detail about the ritual , which was said to be common in the slavic region after the advent of christianity there : believed vampires would either be decapitated or hanged until their body naturally fell from the head due to decomposition . livescience points out that there were other ways to deal with suspected vampires , like using metal stakes to secure the corpse to the ground . archaeologists in bulgaria made just such a discovery last year .
