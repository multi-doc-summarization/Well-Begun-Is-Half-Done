we 've heard plenty of public outcry about gov . mike pence signing the religious freedom restoration act into law last week . so who is cheering the law on ? a family-owned pizza joint in walkerton , indiana . " if a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding , we would have to say no , " crystal o'connor of memories pizza tells abc 57 . the station reports the family says gays are welcome to simply dine thereâ€”just not to order a wedding pie . " we are a christian establishment , " says crystal . " we 're not discriminating against anyone , that 's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything . " crystal 's dad , kevin , tells the station he also concurs with the bill . " i choose to be heterosexual . they choose to be homosexual . why should i be beat over the head to go along with something they choose ? " he says of potential gay customers trying to get their nuptials catered . abc 57 reports the reaction has been swift and harsh , noting the pizzeria 's facebook rating has fallen from a 5 to a 1.2 ; its rating is currently a 1 on yelp , too , where some of the current posts are definitely nsfw . ( gov . pence insists the law is being " grossly misconstrued . " )
