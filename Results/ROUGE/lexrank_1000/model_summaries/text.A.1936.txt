alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use , and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself . jamaica 's parliament last night approved a law decriminalizing small amounts of pot , the ap reports . people found with 2 ounces or less of marijuana will now simply receive a ticket—not a crime on their record—and cultivation of five plants or fewer is now allowed . a licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts . rastafarians are rejoicing , because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes , while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island . jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it did n't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking us sanctions , the guardian reports . the process for the new law was described by national security minister peter bunting as an " elephantine , " nearly 40-year effort , abc australia reports . " [ the law ] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens , and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records , " he said in a statement . jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market , the guardian notes . international exporting , however , remains a no-no . a us counternarcotics official told the ap in an email that " jamaican law is of course jamaica 's own business , " but warned that drug trafficking into the us is still illegal .
