president trump 's social media chief had to post a retraction sunday after sharing a video that he wrongly believed showed the impact of hurricane irma . " here is miami international airport . stay safe ! ! " tweeted white house social media director dan scavino , posting a video of flooding at an airport . he was swiftly corrected by miami international airport itself , which pointed out that the video was not from the airport , cnn reports . the real location and date of the video has not been verified , though it was posted on youtube on aug. 31 with a title suggesting that it is mexico city 's airport . it resurfaced on twitter sunday mislabeled as miami . " it was among 100s of videos/pix i am receiving , " scavino tweeted after being corrected . " in trying to notify all , i shared - have deleted . " the error was noteworthy because when scavino shared the video , it was an example of the tweets he said he was sharing with trump and vice president mike pence hourly , raising questions about the accuracy of his information , the washington post reports . the white house declined to comment on how scavino was verifying posts that he shared with trump and pence . miami international airport , meanwhile , says it will be closed until at least tuesday while damage assessment is carried out . ( irma made landfall in florida for a second time sunday . )
