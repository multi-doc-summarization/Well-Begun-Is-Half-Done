" if you 're a gazelle or a wildebeest , a black-footed cat is n't at all deadly , " says hunter , who has studied the cats since the 1990s . " but those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on earth . " and the black-footed cat has tricks . it can hunt by bounding randomly through grass , sneaking up on prey in a weaving pattern , or waiting patiently by burrows for a meal to emerge . they can " wait for up to 2 hours , absolutely immobile , just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear , " hunter says . " and then they nab it . " they kill 10 to 14 small birds and rodents nightly , or about one every 50 minutes—a constant hunt necessary to supply their active metabolisms . like most felines in the series , the black-footed cat is endangered , but hunter accentuates the positive : " i believe it 's mostly not doom and gloom , " he says , but " if we do n't work to reduce those threats , then we could lose some of these animals . " see the episode at pbs . ( or see why a judge has halted grizzly bear hunts around yellowstone national park . )
