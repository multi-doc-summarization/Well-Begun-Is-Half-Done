a new york woman has , according to police , gotten married a few too many times , and she 's now facing felony fraud charges . authorities say liana barrientos , reported as being 38 or 39 , has gotten married 10 times in 11 years , the new york daily news reports , with six of those marriages allegedly occurring between february and august of 2002 . she 's never gotten divorced , according to the daily news and abc 7 , though others report differently : the new york post holds that at least one husband filed for divorce and a second " dumped her , " placing her number of concurrent marriages at eight ; the new york times reports she 's actually divorced from her first two husbands and two others , but that those splits happened " long after marrying 3 through 9 . " the latest alleged nuptials were in 2010 , when barrientos is said to have married a man named salle keita . the changes are in connection with that marriage . " the defendant ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry mr. keita and that was her first and only marriage , " says the legal complaint . officials have n't suggested a motive in the case , the daily news notes , though a source tells the post that " the motive was definitely not love . " while the post reports that she varied the spelling of her name in different marriages , the daily news reports that she allegedly used the same social security number . a man at one of barrientos ' previous homes tells the daily news she 's now living in a homeless shelter . she faces two counts of filing a false instrument , each of which carries a four-year sentence . she was arrested last fall and will be arraigned today . ( it 's far from the only unusual crime to grab headlines this week . )
