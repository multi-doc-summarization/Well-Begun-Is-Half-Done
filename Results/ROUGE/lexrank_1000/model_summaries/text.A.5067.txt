say hello to your great-great-great-great-great-grandparents ( times a few million or so ) —protungulatum donnae , a rat-sized insect eater believed to have lived 66 million years ago . a new six-year study of the mammalian family tree , looking at dna and anatomical evidence in greater detail than ever before , has identified protungulatum donnae as the most likely common ancestor for all 5,400 placental mammal species , reports the new york times . the critter , however , is only hypothetical , notes the la times , explaining that scientists used data to " reverse-engineer " it . the study examined 83 mammals and fossils for more than 4,500 traits , creating a database 10 times larger than any previous database . because protungulatum donnae would have emerged 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great extinction that ended the dinosaurs—about 36 million years later than previous estimates—scientists say this is a clear sign the rise of the mammals was tied to that mass extinction . the abstract to the original article is at science magazine .
