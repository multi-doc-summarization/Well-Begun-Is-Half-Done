donald trump says a meeting with dozens of black pastors at trump tower on monday was " amazing , " " inspiring , " and " unbelievable " â€”but he has no intention of changing his campaign 's tone . his campaign initially said the summit would be followed by public endorsements from more than 100 clergy members , though it later canceled the public part of the meeting and pastors say there were plenty of disagreements during the talk , politico reports . " i asked him : 'are you a racist ? ' " bishop george bloomer tells the ap . " people are saying that about you , " bloomer says he told trump . " if you are seeking the african-american community to support you , at the least , you 're not helping with these kind of things that are going on . " clergy members say the roughing up of a black lives matter protester at a trump rally was discussed , as was trump 's rhetoric on immigration . afterward , trump said , " the beautiful thing about the meeting is they did n't ask me to change the tone , " per politico . some attendees say he did agree to soften his tone somewhat , though the ap reports that at a monday evening rally in macon , ga. , where he was introduced by herman cain , trump repeated the positions on immigration that the pastors had been concerned about . but he has adopted a " newly conciliatory tone on racial matters , " according to the new york times : trump and the clergy members who met with him were strongly criticized by the rev . al sharpton on monday , and trump 's only response in a times interview was , " deep down inside , al likes me a lot .
