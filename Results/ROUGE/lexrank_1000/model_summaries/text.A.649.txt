tech reviewers are seeing the light when they check out the eye-popping high-definition display of the new ipad . lucky columnists with preview models of the ipad 's third version are gushing about the screen 's brilliant display—with a million more pixels than hdtv—and its processing speed . " these upgrades are massive , " writes walter mossberg in the wall street journal . " using the new display is like getting a new eyeglass prescription—you suddenly realize what you thought looked sharp before was n't nearly as sharp as it could be . it has the most spectacular display i have ever seen in a mobile device . " the new ipad even manages to keep its long battery life despite the upgrades . some of the tradeoffs ? the new ipad weighs about 8 % more , and is about 7 % thicker than the last version . and the high-def displays eat up lots of storage . but it hardly seems to matter . " the display is spectacular . apple also improved the camera , added dictation and , on some models , the ability to tap into the speediest available cellular networks , " notes edward baig for usa today . if you still do n't get the picture , here 's what the new york times ' david pogue says : " it 's a very , very sharp screen , four times as sharp as the ipad 2 , " making maps , photos , videos , and text in apps rewritten for the new device look " jaw-droppingly good . " the public was sold even before the reviews : apple expects to sell at least a million new ipads the first day .
