it 's not every day that what is essentially nothingness would be major news , but today is that day : scientists announced in nature that after two years of study , they 've identified a roughly 100-foot-long void in egypt 's great pyramid of gizaâ€”built around 2500 bc , it 's the most ancient of the seven wonders of the ancient world , notes the guardian . it 's the first discovery of a new structure in the monument since the 19th century , and it came by using muography , which can pick up on changes in density within rock . what was found , the bbc reports , is n't being called a " chamber , " and it explains why : also known as khufu 's pyramid , the structure contains voids that are believed to have been incorporated to bolster the structural integrity of the pyramid . while three muon technologies confirmed its existence , " we do n't know whether this big void is horizontal or inclined ... [ or ] made by one structure or several successive structures , " says mehdi tayoubi . it sits above the pyramid 's " most striking " chamber , the grand gallery , a corridor that links the queen 's and king 's chambers . an archaeologist who reviewed the work says it 's possible the void was intended to " protect the very narrow roof " of the gallery , though others contend that for the cavity to effectively have that function , it would need to be smaller . the guardian notes the pharaoh khufu 's mummy is missing , but a harvard egyptologist tells npr the idea that the cavity is " a hidden room and the king 's body is inside ... none of that is responsible speculation at the moment . " the team next hopes to get approval to drill a 1.2-inch hole that a robot could fit into . ( the world 's largest pyramid was mistaken as a mountain . )
