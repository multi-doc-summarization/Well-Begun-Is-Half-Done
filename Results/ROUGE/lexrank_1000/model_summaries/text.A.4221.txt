the cdc warned american hospitals last year to keep an eye out for the emergence of a possibly fatal , drug-resistant yeast infection , and now the agency 's fears may be realized . cdc officials tell the washington post that 35 patients in the us have been stricken with candida auris , a fungus that can cause bloodstream , wound , and ear infections , with another 18 people harboring the microbe without becoming ill . some strains of the pathogen do n't respond to the three main classes of antifungal drugs , and based on the small number of cases health officials have had the chance to review , 60 % of patients hit with c. auris have died ( though the agency notes many of those patients had other serious medical issues they were contending with ) . the fungus is contagious and durable , especially in health care facilities , where it can stick around on furniture and other equipment for months . the first c. auris strain was reported in 2009 in a japanese man , and it has since spread around the globe , including to colombia , india , israel , kenya , kuwait , pakistan , south korea , venezuela , and the uk . the first us case was reported in 2013 , and the cdc 's latest report places 28 of the incidents in new york state , with other affected states including new jersey , maryland , massachusetts , and illinois . cdc acting director anne schuchat said at a recent briefing that " scary , " " difficult to combat " drug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise , per the post . some good news is that c. auris has n't morphed yet into new strains , and most people 's chances of contracting it are very low , with it only affecting " the sickest of the sick , " says cdc infectious disease specialist tom chiller . also encouraging : a recent study iding an antifungal that may prove useful .
