now anyone with a home-brewing kit can drink president obama 's private beer . the administration gave in today and posted a step-by-step video on how to produce the white house brew , the washington post reports . the key ingredients in white house honey brown ale turn out to be amber crystal malt , light malt extract , gypsum , honey , corn sugar , and yeast . but try procuring their fresh honey : it was taken from the south lawn 's first-ever bee hive , according to white house chef sam kass . the recipe was inspired by " a local brew shop , " kass admits , and refined with advice from brewers already working at the white house . " as far as we know the white house honey brown ale is the first alcohol brewed or distilled on the white house grounds , " even though george washington distilled whiskey and brewed beer at mount vernon , thomas jefferson fermented his own wine , and there was drinking during prohibition , writes kass . the recipe revelation comes after a long public campaign that included a petition and freedom of information request .
