the far-fetched idea of california seceding from the nation took a tiny step forward this week . california 's secretary of state agreed to allow a group called yes california to begin collecting signatures for a ballot measure , reports the los angeles times . if 585,407 are collected by july 25—a high hurdle for the relatively small group—a proposal will land on the 2018 ballot to erase lines in the state constitution outlining california as " an inseparable part of the united states " and the us constitution as the " supreme law of the land . " if passed , it would set up a 2019 vote on whether california should become " a free , sovereign and independent country . " even if that passed , huge hurdles remain . secession would require a constitutional amendment , with two-thirds support in both the us house and senate and ratification by at least 38 states . " it 's basically impossible , " notes a post at new york . the idea of a " calexit " has been in the works since 2014 , but the wall street journal notes that it got a boost after donald trump 's election as a mostly jokey way to register opposition . seems nuts ? " i think we 'd have the votes today , " says a group co-founder , who argues that california gives the federal government more money than it receives and is " culturally " separate from the rest of the country . " america already hates california , and america votes on emotions . " adds a rep for the california national party , which supports secession in the long-term but not the current effort , " it 's certainly as likely as donald trump becoming president . " ( the movement already has a moscow " embassy " . )
