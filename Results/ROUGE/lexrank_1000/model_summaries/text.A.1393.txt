fox sports radio host clay travis , ostensibly appearing on cnn friday afternoon to discuss the white house calling for the firing of espn 's jemele hill , instead informed a perplexed brooke baldwin that he only believes in two things : " the first amendment and boobs , " mediaite reports . the understandably confused cnn host first asked travis to clarify whether he was saying " booze " or " boobs , " entertainment weekly reports . “ boobs . two things that never let me down : the first amendment and boobs , ” travis responded . “ those are the two things i believe in absolutely in the country. ” asked why he would say something like that to a female host on national tv , travis reiterated , " because i like boobs and the first amendment . " at that point , baldwin cut the interview short . later on twitter , travis accused baldwin of having " lost it . " in her own twitter reaction , baldwin said , " note to men -- that is never okay . " she expanded in an opinion piece on cnn : " this is not okay . speaking to women like this is unacceptable . " she remembers thinking at the time , " it is 2017 , and this grown man is on my show talking with me—a female host—about boobs . is this seriously happening ? " cnn has canceled another scheduled interview with travis and wo n't book him again . sportswriter keith reed , who appeared alongside travis during the friday panel , said travis ' comments were an excellent example of the kind of sexism jemele hill has had to deal with being a woman in the sports world .
