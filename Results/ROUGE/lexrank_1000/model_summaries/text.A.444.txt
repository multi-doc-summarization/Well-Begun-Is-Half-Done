it 's going to take decades to completely decommission the fukushima nuclear power plant , but a critical step in that process began in earnest today , reports nbc news . one of the six 136-foot covers draped over one of the plant 's nuclear reactors to keep radioactive materials from seeping out is being painstakingly removed . tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off , and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath . the project , which was supposed to commence last july , was previously postponed because of fears of radiation escaping . " for the safety of fukushima 's residents , we would like the work to proceed with extra care , " says the chief of a group of monitors overseeing the project . the total cost and time for the entire decommissioning assignment : tens of billions of dollars over 30 years or so , nbc notes . meanwhile , the japanese government today approved an increase in compensation payments to tepco to a total of $ 57.2 billion , reuters reports . that 's $ 7.7 billion added onto the $ 49.5 billion in taxpayer-funded aid that tepco had previously been approved to receive .
