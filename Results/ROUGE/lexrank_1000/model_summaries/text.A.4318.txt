comets stink , and not just because they have the potential to cause cataclysmic devastation if they ever came hurtling through our atmosphere and made impact with earth . these " cosmic snowballs of frozen gases , rock , and dust roughly the size of a small town " ( as described by nasa ) literally stink to high heaven , according to scientists at switzerland 's university of bern . one comet does , anyway : researchers analyzed the " perfume " of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko and said that its bo is apparently a combo of " rotten eggs , horse urine , formaldehyde , bitter almonds , alcohol , vinegar , and a hint of sweet ether , " the ap reports . " if you could smell the comet , you would probably wish that you had n't , " reads a blog post on the european space agency site . the scientists were able to surmise what the comet would smell like by examining the gas emitted by the " coma , " the comet 's head , phys.org reports . luckily , instead of a squeamish human , a mass spectrometer aboard the space probe rosetta was assigned the task of parsing out the perfumed molecules of 67p , including ammonia , methane , hydrogen sulfide , hydrogen cyanide , and " the pungent , suffocating ( odor ) of formaldehyde , " notes the esa post . the probe caught up to the comet in august after chasing it nearly 4 billion miles ; it will be sending its philae robot lander onto the comet proper on nov. 12 , nasa reports . and it appears the comet 's odoriferous odyssey is just beginning : the lead scientist on the project says that as 67p gets closer to the sun , it will start stinking up the cosmos even more . ( whatever happened to nasa 's plans to harpoon comets ? )
