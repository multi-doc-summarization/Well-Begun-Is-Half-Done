look at a van gogh painting today , and you 're not quite getting the full effect . reports in 2013 , as cited in the guardian , revealed that the paintings were fading ; studies have found yellows are turning brown . the color red is also posing a problem in works like wheat stack under a cloudy sky , and researchers are now moving closer to finding out why , chemistry world reports . van gogh often used a pigment known as red lead . the stuff , also called minium , turns whiter when it 's exposed to light . seeking to understand the process , researchers analyzed a tiny dot of paint from the work . the process , which involved shooting x-rays at the paint , showed that the red lead is now covered with what chemistry world calls " degradation products " in the form of other chemicals . the researchers found a substance they call the " missing link " in the degradation process : it 's a mineral lead known as plumbonacrite , hyperallergic reports . light shining on the plumbonacrite has apparently caused the buildup of other chemicals . interestingly , as hyperallergic notes , the researchers say plumbonacrite has never before been reported " in a painting dating from before the mid 20th century . " of course , the color issues actually make van gogh 's work even more impressive , jonathan jones wrote in the guardian : " in the end , the fact that some of van gogh 's colors have changed over the years is simply a homage to his genius . no one , after all , has any complaint about his colors . " last year , van gogh—or rather , his " regrown " ear—made some unusual headlines .
