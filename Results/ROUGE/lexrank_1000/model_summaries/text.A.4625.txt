doctors are reluctantly delaying vaccine schedules for kids , despite knowing the risks of doing so , because they do n't want to alienate parents altogether , reports the new york times . a study published in pediatrics that surveyed 534 primary care physicians found that 93 % of them were asked to delay a vaccine by a parent in any given month ; a fifth of respondents said more than 10 % of parents in their practice had asked for delays . more than one-third of the physicians copped to giving in " often " or " always " ; another 37 % said they did " sometimes . " " doctors are feeling really conflicted because they overwhelmingly think this is the wrong thing to do , and is putting children at risk , but at the same time , they want to build trust with their patients and meet people halfway , " the study 's lead author says , per time . it 's not for lack of trying to reach these vaccine-wary parents , the researchers note : doctors will often use a variety of strategies to convince parents to stick to the traditional schedule , including telling them their own kids have been vaccinated , bringing up possible future outbreaks if they buck vaccination , or even warning that the alternate schedules have n't been studied adequately . but in the end , the doctors still often acquiesce and are faced with a stressful decision . " to know i 'm going to pick one [ vaccine ] and leave the other behind , despite all the time i spend explaining the risks and benefits to the parentsâ€”it 's very difficult for me , " a pediatrics professor at baylor college of medicine tells time .
