kic 8462852 is an odd and fascinating star , astronomers sayâ€”but it probably is n't host to an " alien megastructure , " as some researchers suggested as a longshot possibility when the star and its highly unusual dimming pattern first came to attention . instead , iowa state university researchers who studied infrared light emitted by the star in the cygnus constellation believe that the likeliest explanation is the " destruction of a family of comets , " which caused dramatic changes in the light observed by the kepler telescope as the fragments and debris cloud moved past the star in a long , elliptical orbit . the team did n't actually look for alien structures , but they were able to use the infrared data to rule out possibilities including a massive collision nearby , the washington post reports . the seti institute has also investigated the star , and found no trace of the radio signals that would suggest extraterrestrial technology was present , cnn reports . but even without aliens , nothing like what is happening around kic 8462852 has ever been seen before and astronomers want to learn more . " this is a very strange star , " lead researcher massimo marengo said in a nasa press release . " it reminds me of when we first discovered pulsars . they were emitting odd signals nobody had ever seen before , and the first one discovered was named lgm-1 after 'little green men . ' " " we may not know yet what 's going on around this star , " he added " but that 's what makes it so interesting . " ( closer to home , astronomers have discovered that mars is destroying its own moon . )
