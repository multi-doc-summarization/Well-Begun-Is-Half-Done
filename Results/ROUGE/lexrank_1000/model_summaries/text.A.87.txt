thinking of giving up booze for the month after a hedonistic holiday season ? well , you might be an alcoholic making a big mistake , writes tom sykes at the telegraph . as a recovering alcoholic , sykes should know . " i managed several sober januaries , and they became an important weapon in my armory of denial , " he writes . a real alcoholic , after all , could n't make it , he reasoned . but the truth is the ritual appeals deeply " to the classic all-or-nothing , getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict , " while " normals " have no use for it . he advises instead trying to have just one drink a night—if stopping after one is difficult , you 'll know you have a problem . but if you actually are a " normal , " it turns out there might be some merit in the month-long detox . the staff at the new scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves , and got some pretty astonishing results . ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks , and saw their liver fat , blood glucose , and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly—reducing their risk for liver disease , diabetes , and heart disease—while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes . but it was a fairly limited experiment , offering no clue how long those effects will last . heather timmons at quartz argues that such " detoxes " are " useless " in the long-term , since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own . so instead , she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week , since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking—plus , over the course of a year , that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days .
