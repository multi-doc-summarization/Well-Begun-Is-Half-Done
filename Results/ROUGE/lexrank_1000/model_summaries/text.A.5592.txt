marissa mayer says coverage of her four years at the helm of yahoo has been " gender charged . " " we all see the things that only plague women leaders , like articles that focus on their appearance , like hillary clinton sporting a new pantsuit , " she tells the financial times . " i think all women are aware of that , but i had hoped in 2015 and 2016 that i would see fewer articles like that . it ’ s a shame . " it was announced monday that verizon would acquire the struggling internet pioneer for $ 4.83 billion , which , per the guardian , puts an " ignominious end to mayer ’ s plans to turn yahoo around . " mayer has been oft-criticized for how she has run yahoo , with much of the criticism centering on " bad acquisitions and poor hires , " per the times , such as buying tumblr for $ 1.1 billion—part of what the guardian calls a " wild spending spree . " in a post on that platform , mayer writes , " i ’ m planning to stay . i love yahoo , and i believe in all of you . it ’ s important to me to see yahoo into its next chapter . " but how long that will be remains to be seen . " it might be for a short period , " an analyst tells nbc news . " they might need her input during the integration process . "
