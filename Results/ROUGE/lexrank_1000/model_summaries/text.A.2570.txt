is it football season already ? it must be , based on president trump 's tweets from friday morning . after reports filtered out about some nfl players kneeling , raising their fists , and taking part in other forms of protest during preseason games on thursday evening , trump once more railed against those who did so . " the nfl players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the national anthem , " trump tweeted . " numerous players , from different teams , wanted to show their 'outrage ' at something that most of them are unable to define . they make a fortune doing what they love ... ... " he continued in a second tweet : " be happy , be cool ! a football game , that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy , is no place to protest . most of that money goes to the players anyway . " and a final warning : " find another way to protest . stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay ! " politico and the washington post take issue with trump 's assertion that the players have n't been able to define what they 're protesting , with politico noting the players are pushing back against " racial injustice and police brutality . " the post goes even deeper , compiling very specific statements from the players themselves . in may , the nfl banned players from sitting or kneeling during the anthem , but that policy was put on hold in july and wo n't be enforced as the league and players union try to hash things out on the sidelines .
