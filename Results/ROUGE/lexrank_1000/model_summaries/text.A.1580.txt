just when you thought the republican presidential contest couldn ’ t get any stranger , we have breaking news : herman cain has a gospel album . that ’ s right , the daily caller today discovered an album online bearing the gop hopeful 's distinctive baritone . cain 's camp hasn ’ t commented , but dave weigel of slate has confirmed that “ it ’ s real , it was published 15 years ago … and it is not being distributed now by the cain campaign. ” the six-track offering is entitled sunday morning , and believe it or not , it ’ s actually pretty decent . “ it ’ s mostly standard gospel fare , ” says frances martel of mediaite , but it has “ one standout single : ‘ this is the day , ’ a fast-paced track reminiscent of 'footloose ' that certainly wins the prize for funnest danceable track on the album . … really , give ‘ this is the day ’ a listen ! ”
