" watching gigi hadid stare at you for four minutes is weirdly mesmerizing . " that 's the conclusion glamour comes to , at least , upon the release of a video it produced that features hadid . staring , and occasionally blinking , in slow motion . for four minutes and nine seconds . and that 's it ( though she does laugh near the end , prompting one person to comment on youtube , " 3:53 melted my heart and make my eyes wet ? " ) . at slate , heather schwedel looks at where this fits in to the buzzy " pivot to video " that 's underway in the media world , with more and more publications dumping journalists and shifting their resources to producing video . her conclusion : " this is how backward our world is , now : a video of a hadid doing nothing makes a weird sort of sense . of course ! brilliant ! " schwedel speculates that this started out as an inside joke born from photo-shoot footage , but writes , " it ’ s just as fun to imagine that the editors at glamour were so devoid of ideas that they asked hadid to sit there and do nothing for a while on camera . " and she sees the whole thing as reflective of " how clueless many magazines are about how to produce good videos for the web . " but , she concedes , maybe this is a " step up , " at least compared with the " glorified slideshows " that have become a popular approach to creating cheap videos . at man repeller , amelia diamond writes that she did get sucked in by the video , but the credit may not go to hadid . " could you have watched anyone for this long with the right song ? i think maybe i could have . it ’ s strangely voyeuristic . "
