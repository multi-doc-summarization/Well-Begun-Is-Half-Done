king harold ii 's death is immortalized in the bayeux tapestry , which shows england 's final anglo-saxon king taking an arrow to the eye during the battle of hastings on oct. 14 , 1066 ; norman knights then were said to have hacked him to pieces . now , a team is tugging on the tapestry 's threads to see if that story holds . the same geological survey company that unearthed richard iii under a parking lot will tomorrow ( that 's the 948th anniversary of the death ) scan the ground where harold is supposed to be buried in an investigation of an alternate tale : that the king actually survived and lived another four decades as a hermit . that theory was penned in a document called the vita haroldi in the 12th century , and amateur historian peter burke believes it to be true , so much so that he 's funding the scan at essex 's waltham abbey church . king harold is said to be buried in a tomb at the high altar there , but burke suspects he 's actually interred about 45 feet away , near the east wall . " we have the norman story put through the bayeux tapestry—the english story is a different one , " he tells the independent . as the telegraph reports , burke hopes the scan will reveal harold 's body—and that it will prove to be the remains of an elderly man , indicating the king did indeed regain health and then fled to germany two years later . should the scan surface " old man , 6 foot 1 , with scarring to his temple and cheek ... then we will need a dna test , " burke tells culture24 . who would be in the tomb then ? the hertfordshire mercury reports harold 's wife , edith , could have ided a headless knight as her husband in order to hide the truth . ( another big discovery relates to alexander the great . )
