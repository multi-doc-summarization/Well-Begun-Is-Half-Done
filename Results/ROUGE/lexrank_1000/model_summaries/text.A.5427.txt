cia director john brennan is hitting back after sen. dianne feinstein confirmed reports that the cia illegally searched senate intelligence committee computers . " we were n't trying to block anything , " brennan tells nbc . " the cia was in no way spying on [ the committee ] or the senate . " feinstein had earlier equated the surveillance with intimidation , notes the washington post , saying , " i am not taking it lightly . " the cia has broken federal laws , an executive order against domestic spying , and the fourth amendment , she says . the agency 's own probe of the claims has been referred to the justice department , and criminal prosecution could be on the table , feinstein notes . the searching occurred in january , the senator says , per the ap . her claims come after reports that the cia spied on computers it had provided to the committee for use in reviewing a trove of millions of top secret documents . the committee was looking into information on interrogation techniques . further reports suggested that senate staffers took classified documents from the computers . feinstein , for her part , says she does n't know how certain interrogation documents ended up in committee handsâ€”whether they were offered by the cia , mistakenly provided , or handed over by whistleblowers . sen. patrick leahy called feinstein 's speech " one of the best " he 'd " ever heard " on the hill , " and one of the most important .
