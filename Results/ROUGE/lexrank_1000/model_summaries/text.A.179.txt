archaeologists in england digging at a 14th-century burial site made an unexpected discovery : a couple buried together holding hands had remained that way all this time , reports abc news . the man and woman were found at the site of an ancient chapel in hallaton , along with nine other skeletons , reports the leicester mercury . the couple appear to be the same age , but scientists plan further study to see whether they can determine the cause of death . they also hope to determine why the bodies were buried at this particular site , quite a distance away from a " perfectly good church in hallaton , " says a lead researcher from the university of leicester . leading theories are that the burial site was used for those who were either sick , criminals , or foreign pilgrims . one man at the site apparently died of a head wound , perhaps from a pole ax in battle , while another had his legs raised to his chest , possibly because of a disease of some kind . researchers hope further work at the chapel can fill in a gap of about 500 years when not much is known about what went on in the region , reports the international business times . ( another recent archaeological discovery sheds light on the brutal way richard iii died . )
