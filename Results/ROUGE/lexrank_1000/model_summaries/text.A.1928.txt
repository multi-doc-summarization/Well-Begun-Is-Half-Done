if all conflicts could be solved through dance-offs , the world would be much less violent ( and channing tatum would probably be president , or something ) . thankfully it 's a world we 're one step closer to after a washington , dc , police officer and iraq war veteran was caught on camera defusing a situation with some local teens through the undeniable power of the nae nae , the washington post reports . after an unnamed officer broke up a fight between some teens and ordered the crowd to disperse monday , 17-year-old aaliyah taylor instead started playing the song " watch me ( whip/nae nae ) " on her phone and dancing . the officer 's reaction was a breath of fresh air , to say the least . " i started to dance and then the cop was like , ' i could do better , ' " taylor tells nbc washington . " i was in shock . " taylor shared the video of the ensuing dance-off on facebook , where it 's been viewed nearly 700,000 times as of this writing . she tells the post all seven of her siblings have been roughly handcuffed or arrested in the past for nonviolent crimes . that 's why she 's usually afraid of cops , according to nbc . that changed monday . “ instead of us fighting , she tried to turn it around and make it something fun , ” taylor says . “ i never expected cops to be that cool . " the hill reports even obama is a fan , with the president tweeting : " who knew community policing could involve the nae nae ? great example of police having fun while keeping us safe . " for her part , the officer tells the post she 's embarrassed the video is getting so much attention because it 's the kind of good policing officers do every day .
