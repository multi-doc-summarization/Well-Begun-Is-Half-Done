it 's " extremely likely " that sea levels rose faster in the 20th century than at any other time in the previous 2,700 years " and the rise over the last two decades has been even faster , " scientists say . a new study—based on " reconstructions " of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world , plus tide gauges—finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the industrial revolution , reports usa today . " we can say with 95 % probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries , " the lead author tells the washington post . sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000 , or about 1.4 millimeters per year . nasa puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year . scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100—if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in paris . but a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet . another study in proceedings of the national academy of sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers did n't consider the collapse of glaciers of the west antarctic ice sheet , which " is hypothesized to be already underway . " there 's no surprise why : humans burned fossil fuels , which produced greenhouse gases , which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters , scientists say . if not for humans , sea levels might not have risen at all and thousands of coastal " nuisance " floods in the us would have been avoided , according to climate central . ( some 316 us cities may be partially submerged by 2100 . )
