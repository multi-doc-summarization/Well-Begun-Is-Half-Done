sean penn 's 2015 mexican sitdown with drug lord joaquin guzman ( aka " el chapo " ) , which he documented in an early 2016 rolling stone article , caused its fair share of controversy . and the ruckus is n't over yet , as the actor is now going after netflix for a documentary on guzman , set to start airing friday , that penn 's spokesman says in an email to the new york times is a " profoundly false , foolish , and reckless narrative " that could put penn 's life in danger . the actor 's main bone of contention with the day i met el chapo : the kate del castillo story : that he thinks the three-episode film hints he assisted the doj in helping to capture el chapo , who was busted right around the time penn 's rolling stone article went public . del castillo , a mexican actress , was with penn when he met with guzman , and the film is said to take place from her pov . producer david broome denies there 's anything in the film that says penn " is in cahoots " with the justice department and that both he and netflix tried to see if penn wanted to take part ( penn reportedly never answered ) ; netflix backs that up , saying in a statement " penn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate . " broome says when penn saw an advance copy of the film , he demanded changes . deadline notes that penn 's lawyers contacted netflix shortly after and said penn was afraid guzman 's associates might go after him if the film was n't altered . a letter from penn 's lawyer to netflix notes that " blood will be on [ netflix 's ] hands if this film causes bodily harm " to penn . ( in the end , penn thought his rolling stone article on el chapo was a failure . )
