katy perry gave a " roar " to hillary clinton in a pre-election concert , and tuesday night clinton returned the favor . the ex-presidential candidate showed at unicef 's snowflake ball in new york city , serving as a surprise presenter for the audrey hepburn humanitarian award bestowed upon perry , per the hollywood reporter . " i can not tell you how delighted i am to be here to help celebrate … a global megastar , a social media queen with the most twitter followers in the world—although she 's getting some competition—and someone whose powerful voice and creative lyrics remind us when you get knocked down to get back up , " clinton said in a speech that left perry asking the crowd for a tissue . the twitter remark seemed to refer to tweeter-in-chief donald trump , whom perry also slightly riffed on when she noted , " i 'm happy i 've helped highlight the effects of climate change , which is real . " the telegraph notes this is only the second public appearance clinton has made since the election ( the first was at a children 's defense fund event in mid-november ) . and clinton made it a memorable one , noting " i 've gotten to spend time with [ perry ] and i know how deeply she cares about making our world a better place " and that " we need champions like katy now more than ever . " perry , a vocal clinton supporter in the presidential race and a unicef ambassador since 2013 , returned the compliment as clinton left the stage , saying , " i 've always had a voice—a singing voice—but i 've never had a voice like i 've had before . hillary has lit that voice inside of me , and that light will never go out . " the crowd apparently agreed , as it gave clinton a long standing round of applause , the new york post reports . ( fans in china blame clinton 's election loss for a canceled perry concert . )
