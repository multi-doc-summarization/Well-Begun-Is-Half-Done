a jaguar is being sent home to kerala , india , from a new delhi breeding program after being accused of having a dad bod without the " dad " part . salman had been borrowed by the delhi zoo to mate with kalpana , its female jaguar , but there were problems : salman turned out to be too corpulent and lethargic to mate , the bbc reports . salman has " reached out for its meals more keenly than for kalpana , " a zookeeper complains to the indian express , adding that " the female is seen trying to entice him but he lies in a corner and refuses to respond . he is too fat to breed . " salman , who rt.com notes is said to weigh around 220 pounds , does have his defenders , who point out to the express that two other male jaguars also did n't produce offspring with kalpana and that breeding cats sometimes just do n't feel like mating after being relocated . but workers at the zoo say salman is a different animal altogether than the previous competition . " he is lazy , a glutton , just loves to eat and relax , " one of the caretakers tells the paper . ( maybe vin diesel needs to have a heart-to-heart with salman . )
