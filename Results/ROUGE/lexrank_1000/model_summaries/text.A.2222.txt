" so the white house did not give you anything to say , " asked chuck todd . " they did not give me anything to say , " miller confirmed , which the times notes is ominous given that he was the only white house rep made available to the sunday talk shows . miller calls it " an important matter " and " a sensitive matter , " reports the ap . at issue is whether flynn discussed us sanctions in calls with russia 's ambassador while president obama was still in office . the conversations may have broken us law aimed at barring private citizens from conducting diplomacy . a washington post report last week contradicted flynn 's previous denials . elsewhere on the sunday dial : miller says that immigration and customs enforcement 's emphasis is on deporting those he calls " criminal aliens " and who " pose a threat to public safety . " miller says " we 're going to focus on public safety and saving american lives and we will not apologize . " president trump tweeted that " gang members , drug dealers & others are being removed ! " miller says the white house is exploring " all of our options " after a federal appeals court handed the administration a legal setback on trump 's executive order on immigration . chuck schumer had succinct commentary on the travel ban , per politico : " i think he ought to throw it in the trash , " schumer said . " i think this executive order is so bad and so poisoned and its genesis is so bad and terrible that he ought to just throw it in the trash can . "
