apparently you can credit amalia damonte for jorge bergoglio becoming pope francis—or perhaps her father , reports the week . when bergoglio was just 12 , he had a young " romance " with damonte , writing a letter saying they would be married and drawing a picture of the house they would live in . she said he vowed to become a priest if amalia , who lived near him in a buenos aires suburb , rejected the offer . however , damonte 's father was n't about to stand for his 12-year-old daughter talking to boys , and slapped her for starting to write back . " i never saw him after that—my parents kept me away from him and did everything possible to separate us , " says damonte , adding that " it was a thing between children and totally pure . " the telegraph , meanwhile , catches up with the pope 's sister , maria elena bergoglio , who says her brother was never jazzed about the prospect of leading the church . " he did n't want to be pope and when we chatted privately about it , we joked at the prospect and he would say , 'no , please no . ' "
