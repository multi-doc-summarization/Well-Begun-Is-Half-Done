one of the most reproductively successful pandas in captivity is no longer stuck with a chipped tooth . on wednesday , the san diego zoo 's giant female panda bai yun underwent a procedure to fix a chipped lower canine tooth that could have seriously cut down her bamboo consumption , the los angeles times reports . a veterinarian team gave the 23-year-old panda anesthesia , then used a dental composite to fill the damaged area before giving bai yun 's chompers a cleaning . " the good news is the pulp canal had n't been compromised , but it 's very close to breaking into the pulp canal , " the vet said , per the times of san diego . the procedure will " hopefully , prevent any further chipping or deterioration . " that 's good news for bai yun , who spends up to 12 hours a day munching on bamboo . the effort used to break down the chewy and not-so-nutritious food makes pandas especially prone to damaged teeth , the times reports .
