" as it turns out , he was pointing to a cat in the outfield that went on to interrupt the game for a few entertaining minutes . when the game resumed , molina hit a grand slam on the very next pitch , and the lead held for a st. louis victory . " i 'm not a cat person , but i sure like that one , " cardinals manager mike matheny said after the game . the mlb site has video of the cat ( immediately dubbed " rally cat " in the game 's broadcast ) scampering around and either biting or scratching the st. louis field crew member who finally corralled it . others are posting youtube clips . it 's not clear whether the cat is a stray , but if so it would surely find a home quickly given the fans ' reaction . the incident calls to mind a similar one involving a squirrel in the 2011 playoffs . in fact , as the post-dispatch notes , the cards etched a silhouette of " rally squirrel " on their championship rings that year .
