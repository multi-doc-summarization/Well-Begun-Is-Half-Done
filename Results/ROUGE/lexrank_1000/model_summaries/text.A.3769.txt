not all scientific research takes place in labs . just ask food anthropologist sergio grasso and physicists andrey varlamov and andreas glatz , who had the tough job of sampling margherita pizzas across rome in the lead up to their paper , " the physics of baking good pizza . " the pizzaiolos of italy have the process down pat , relying on curved brick ovens heated to 625 degrees fahrenheit to perfectly bake the pie of tomato , mozzarella , and basil on all sides in two minutes , the authors found . they also learned duplicating this process in your standard electric oven would turn a pizza to " coal " since metal conducts heat much better than brick , reports live science . there is a solution , however . per particle , the authors developed a mathematical formula to show how a pizza could be baked to near-perfection in an electric oven . they recommend baking a pie at 450 degrees fahrenheit for 170 seconds , or slightly longer if the chosen toppings have a high water content " as the pizza will return more heat to the oven via evaporation , " per live science . broiling the top at this point would work , too , per reader 's digest . while you may not get the even cook of a brick oven—if necessary , pizzaiolos lift the pizza base from the oven while allowing the toppings to continue cooking with radiant heat for about 30 seconds—the pie should be similar to rome 's pizza , the authors say . ( just do n't substitute the mozzarella . )
