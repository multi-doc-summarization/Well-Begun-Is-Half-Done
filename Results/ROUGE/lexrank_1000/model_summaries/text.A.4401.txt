apple finally responded to the accusations that it was tracking iphone users ’ locations today , saying it “ has never done so and has no plans to ever do so. ” in a statement , which you can read on techcrunch , the company explained that it was actually keeping a log not of the phone ’ s location , but of the location of wifi hotspots and cell towers , “ some of which may be located more than one hundred miles away from your iphone. ” the data is used to more quickly triangulate users ’ position when they use location-based services , and is sent to apple anonymously . but the company did admit to some “ bugs ” in the software—like that it keeps collecting data even after you ’ ve turned location services off , and that it stored years of data , instead of the week 's worth it needs—and promised an ios update to fix them . and , just to add some positive news to the cycle , it also announced that the rumored white iphone will be available tomorrow , time reports .
