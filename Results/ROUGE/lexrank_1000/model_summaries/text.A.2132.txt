scientists studying the calls of adult argentine horned frogs were amazed to discover that the species ' larvae also make soundsâ€”screams even , reports the independent . the tadpole 's scream is a " brief , clear and very audible metallic-like sound , " say researchers . they believe the distress calls save the tadpoles from being cannibalized by adults of their species , which is known for its willingness to eat anything it can , including other kinds of frogs . this is the first time underwater larvae or any vertebrate larvae have been known to make sounds , the bbc notes . the researchers believe the discovery has wide-reaching implications for the understanding of amphibian behavior . " we have definitely underestimated their abilities , " says the lead researcher , who now plans to study how other tadpoles respond to the sound .
