washington , dc , appears poised to become the first municipality in the nation to let 16-year-olds vote in national elections , including presidential races . a measure to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 cleared a committee last week and now heads to the full council , reports wtop . to pass , it needs the support of a majority of the 13-member city council , and wjla reports that eight members already have voiced their approval . while a handful of us cities allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections , none grants the right in national elections . dc has an estimated 10,000 teens of that age , most of them minorities , per wjla . “ at the age of 16 , your legal relationship with the government changes , ” says council member charles allen , who introduced the measure . he points out that many 16-year-olds get jobs and begin paying taxes , and they also start driving . " ironically , they pay fees to get a license plate that reads ‘ end taxation without representation. ’ i think it ’ s time to change that. ” allen says he was inspired in part by the youth political movement that surfaced after school shootings . if passed by the council and signed by the mayor , the measure must undergo a 30-day congressional review period . ( one leader of the youth political movement has big plans for himself by the age of 25 . )
