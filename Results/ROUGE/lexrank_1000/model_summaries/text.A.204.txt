when you 've got a civil matter overlapping with a criminal one , you may need to prioritize which fire to deal with first . a federal judge agrees in the case of michael cohen , approving on friday a 90-day stay in the civil lawsuit against him and president trump by stephanie clifford ( aka porn star stormy daniels ) , the washington post reports . the reasoning : trump 's personal lawyer filed a declaration this week noting he intends to plead the fifth in the daniels case , as he fears answering questions in that matter could potentially implicate himself in the criminal probe against him in new york , per npr . fbi agents working on the latter investigation carried out a raid on cohen 's home and office in early april , and because part of that mission was to seek documents related to daniels ' nondisclosure agreement , there may be " large potential factual overlap " with daniels ' civil case , per otero . " this is no simple criminal investigation , " otero noted friday . " whether or not an indictment is forthcoming , and the court thinks it likely based on these facts alone , these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay . " daniels ' lawyer , michael avenatti , responded to otero 's ruling on twitter , tweeting : " while we certainly respect judge otero 's 90 day stay order based on mr. cohen 's pleading of the 5th , we do not agree with it . we will likely be filing an immediate appeal to the ninth circuit early next week . justice delayed is justice denied . " he added to the new york times that " we want to get the truth to the american people as quickly as possible . " the post , however , notes it 's not unusual for those facing both civil and criminal issues to do exactly what cohen 's doing to avoid incrimination . the next hearing for the civil case has been set for july 27 .
