a judge on friday tossed out a $ 417 million jury award to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer by using johnson & johnson talc-based baby powder for feminine hygiene , the ap reports . los angeles county superior court judge maren nelson granted the company 's request for a new trial , saying there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial that ended with the award two months ago . nelson also ruled that there was n't convincing evidence that johnson & johnson acted with malice and the award for damages was excessive . the decision will be appealed even though eva echeverria has died , said her attorney , mark robinson jr. " we will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product , " he said in a statement . echeverria alleged johnson & johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about talcum powder 's potential cancer risks . she used the company 's baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007 , according to court papers . her attorney contended that documents showed that johnson & johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer for three decades . but a company rep says in a statement , " ovarian cancer is a devastating diseaseâ€”but it is not caused by the cosmetic-grade talc we have used in johnson 's baby powder for decades . the science is clear . " similar allegations have led to hundreds of lawsuits against the new jersey-based company . jury awards have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars . however , a $ 72 million award was also thrown out tuesday .
