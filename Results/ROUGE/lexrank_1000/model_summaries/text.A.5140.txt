a man suspected of killing one of former president george hw bush 's doctors may have been seeking revenge for his mother , who died on the doctor 's operating table more than 20 years ago , authorities said wednesday . joseph james pappas , 62 , should be considered armed , dangerous , and possibly suicidal , houston police chief art acevedo said at a news conference wednesday afternoon . " there was a lot of planning that went into this , " acevedo said of the july 20 attack on dr. mark hausknecht , adding that it appears a " 20-year-old grudge " led to the attack , per cnn . hausknecht was gunned down while riding his bike to work at houston methodist hospital , which is part of the busy texas medical center . authorities say the shooter rode past hausknecht before turning around and firing . a tip on tuesday led police to suspect pappas , the chief said , though he did n't elaborate as to the nature of the tip . acevedo said pappas had n't been seen in 36 to 48 hours , the ap reports . he said the last anyone had heard from pappas was in a tuesday morning text message in which pappas wrote that he was going to kill himself . acevedo said police searched his home at 4am wednesday and found evidence that ties pappas to the killing , but he declined to elaborate as to the nature of the evidence . the chief said pappas , who was a peace officer in harris county for three decades per the houston chronicle , is white and very fit , and that he 's likely getting around on his 10-speed bicycle , which he rides " extensively and almost exclusively . " friends and family have described hausknecht as a humble and generous man who was adored by his patients , volunteered in his community and cared about the environment . he was also an avid cyclist and rode his bike to work each morning , as he lived less than 2 miles from his office .
