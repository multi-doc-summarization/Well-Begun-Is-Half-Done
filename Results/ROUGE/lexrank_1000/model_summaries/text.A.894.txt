after hearing about the detroit man who walks 21 miles to work , a des moines register reporter was told about " a guy in southern iowa who walks even farther " and discovered resolute pedestrian steven simoff . the 61-year-old regularly walks 35 miles from his home in the small town of davis city near the missouri border to his job as a casino janitor in osceola , setting off at 3:30pm to start the night shift at 11pm . he says he makes the trek to support wife renee , who has suffered serious health problems , and grandson steven iii , whom the couple has adopted . " first of all , when you got a family , and you 've got a job , you 've got to be able to support your family , " he tells the register . " and you 've got to keep your jobâ€”the most two important things i can think of . " simoff , who earns $ 9.07 an hour at the casino and lives in davis city because rent is cheap there , has a 2002 minivan but ca n't afford to fill it up very often . but he does get plenty of help from the community , the christian science monitor reports . he often gets rides home from work from colleagues who live in nearby towns , and he has a network of " road friends " who give him rides at least part of the way to the casino most days . still , simoff says he averages around four hours of walking a day , much of it on interstate 35 . " if i do n't get to work , bills do n't get paid , " he tells the register . " as long as my two feet are good and my health is good , i do n't think i 'll change . " ( a canadian city is considering freezing an old rail line so commuters can skate to work in winter . )
