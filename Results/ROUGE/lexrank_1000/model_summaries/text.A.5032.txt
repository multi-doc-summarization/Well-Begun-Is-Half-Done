take your pick as to which of these statements from alibaba founder jack ma is gloomier : he 's going back on his pledge to create 1 million us jobs , and the us-china trade war that he blames for that plan 's undoing is one that he believes could last two decades . " it 's going to last long , it 's going to be a mess , " the chinese tech billionaire said tuesday . he addressed the jobs plan , made after he met with then president-elect donald trump in january 2017 , on wednesday : " this promise was on the basis of friendly china-us cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations , but the current situation has already destroyed that basis . this promise ca n't be completed . " cnn provides background , explaining ma 's " vague promise " did n't involve building alibaba facilities in the us , but rather by helping fire up small us businesses by enabling them to better tap into the chinese market . the wall street journal also uses the word " vague " to describe how critics viewed ma 's pledge , observing that , nearly two years later , alibaba has n't released any figures related to the number of jobs created thus far . count the washington post among those critics . it points out that based on commerce department figures , 1 million new american jobs would require that us exports to china rise by an additional $ 206 billion a year . that 's a more than 100 % jump over 2017 's $ 188 billion in exports , a figure that encompasses things that would n't benefit from alibaba 's platform , like airplanes .
