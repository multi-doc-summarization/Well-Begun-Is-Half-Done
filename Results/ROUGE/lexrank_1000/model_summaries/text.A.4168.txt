the us has a simple choice , according to pyongyang : meet north korea at the negotiating table , or in a " nuclear-to-nuclear showdown . " senior north korean official choe son hui put the planned june 12 summit between president trump and kim jong un in even more doubt thursday with a blistering statement that warned pyongyang would n't " beg " for dialogue and called mike pence a " political dummy , " the wall street journal reports . choe , the north 's vice minister of foreign affairs , slammed pence for comparing north korea to libya in the context of denuclearization . " i can not suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the us vice president , " she said . choe—who warned that pyongyang could make the us " taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined " —was responding to pence 's comment to fox news earlier this week , in which he said the clinton and obama administrations had been " played " by north korea and it would be a mistake for the koreans to think they could do the same to trump , the ap reports . the bbc notes that choe is one of kim 's top aides and her statements will have been sanctioned by the leader . trump said tuesday that the summit " may not work out " for june 12 , but he sounded more optimistic wednesday , before choe 's remarks were released . " right now we 're looking at it , we 're talking about it , and they ’ re talking to us , " he told fox . " we have certain conditions . we 'll see what happens . but there 's a good chance . "
