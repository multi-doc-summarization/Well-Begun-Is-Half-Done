we 've had " cornerstone caroline , " " pool patrol paula , " and " bbq becky . " now : " golfcart gail . " that 's the nickname given by ginger williams to a woman she says was at her son 's soccer game in ponte vedra , fla. , this weekend , harassing a black dad cheering his son on . williams ' sunday facebook post—titled " soccer while black " —shows a pic of the unnamed woman , on her phone in a golf cart , allegedly making a call about a man williams says was simply shouting out instructions to his son . the dad simply " yelled 'the ref is right ' when he saw his kid out there getting frustrated after a call , " williams notes . that apparently set " gail " off , and she told the dad " harassment wo n't be tolerated " and " continued to harass and beleaguer him . " nbc news explains talking to the ref in a game is n't permitted , but williams writes the man explained he was talking to his own son . he finally offered to just leave to defuse the situation , williams adds , at which point " golfcart gail " said she was still calling the cops " because she no longer felt safe with his threatening behavior . " ( nbc news also has some video . ) a rep for the st. johns county sheriff 's office says the woman in the golf cart is an athletic association field marshal , and the head of that group says the cops were called not just because of that dad , " but as a result of a culmination of several immediate prior incidents " at the game , including a mom who was cursing and another dad who 'd been ejected for being verbally abusive , per wtlv . deputies did n't detain the father from williams ' post , ided as gerald jones . he 's not so sure it was n't a racially spurred incident and says the field marshal and the soccer club owe him an apology , reports wtlv . ( remember " permit patty " ? )
