a government pamphlet 's advice for pregnant women in india is n't going over well . the booklet titled " mother and child care " tells the women to " detach themselves from desire , anger , attachment , hatred and lust , " spurn " impure thoughts , " look at " beautiful pictures " to benefit their fetus , and avoid meat and eggs , per the ap and hindustan times . according to one gynecologist in india , the advice is n't just " unscientific and irrational , " but it 's " a national shame " in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother 's death in 2015 , due in part to malnutrition and anemia . that 's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the us , according to unicef . since women are typically the last to eat and receive medical care in indian households , the government should be " ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious , high-protein diet , " says gynecologist arun gadre . this would also help prevent stunted births ; some 48 % of indian children under 5 have not grown to the proper height and weight . but " if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs , this situation will only worsen , " gadre says . with its advice against lust , the pamphlet also suggests that engaging in sex is dangerous for pregnant women , contrary to medical evidence . a government minister charged with promoting traditional and alternative medicine says the booklet contains " wisdom accumulated over many centuries " from " the fields of yoga and naturopathy .
