many more american women are dying from cervical cancer than previously thought , with black women in particular dying at rates akin to those in sub-saharan africa , the new york times reports . although cervical cancer is highly preventable , african-american women are dying at a rate 77 % higher that previously estimated , cnn reports . for white women , the rate was 47 % higher . " this shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared , ‚Äù dr. kathleen m. schmeler tells the times . new research in the journal cancer excluded from death rates women who had undergone hysterectomies ; previous research had included them even though they were not at risk because their cervixes were removed . last year , there were 12,990 new cases of cervical cancer in the us , and 4,120 deaths , per the national cancer institute . the new study re-examined those figures . for black women , the news was shockingly bad , with 10.1 per 100,000 dying of cervical cancer ( compared to 4.7 for white women ) , a rate seen in underdeveloped countries , per the times . reasons for the racial disparity included poor access to screenings and the hpv vaccine . experts said screening options must be expanded for at-risk women , and warned that the gap could widen if the affordable care act is repealed and women 's health clinics shuttered . while screenings work well , " many women in america are not getting them , " says schmeler . symptoms for cervical cancer do not appear until late , which is why the american cancer society recommends screenings and a pap test every three years from age 21 , and every five years after age 30 . ( hpv-related cancer is " epidemic . " )
