lpon said outside federal court in manhattan . newline_char to date , he has secured some $ 9 billion — or about half his goal — much of it from madoff investors he has asserted were unjust beneficiaries of “ too good to be true ” returns . newline_char the lawsuit was removed from bankruptcy court , and jed s. newline_char picard had prevailed at trial , he could have recouped as much as $ 303 million , in addition to the $ 83 million the mets ’ owners were already ordered to pay . story_separator_special_tag what happened : the owners of the new york mets have settled with trustee irving picard for $ 162 million , their alleged profit from certain ponzi scheme funds in the six years before bernard madoff 's arrest . newline_char that 's because , as part of the settlement , the wilpons will be able to apply to the trustee to be reimbursed for $ 178 million in losses from certain funds . newline_char obviously , like any victims of madoff 's ponzi scheme , they wo n't recover every dollar . newline_char but they will get a certain percentage based on how much the trustee collects overall from net winners -- likely 50 percent or more . newline_char as a result , the wilpons ' actual payment to picard -- once the wilpons ' loser funds are reimbursed like other victims -- should be a fraction of the actual $ 162 million settlement . newline_char say if picard pays to victims 50 cents on the dollars they lost . newline_char that means the wilpons could be credited $ 89 million ( half of $ 178 million ) toward their $ 162 million owed as a result of the settlement . newline_char that 's a net of only $ 73 million remaining to pay picard to satisfy the settlement .
