 has not been useful for early diagnosis of cancer because of insufficient sensitivity to detect really small tumors that only shed minute quantities of dna into the blood , as well as difficulties with identifying cancer-associated genetic changes without knowing what mutations are present in the primary tumor . newline_char , called targeted error correction sequencing , addresses both of these limitations and demonstrates the feasibility of detecting circulating cell-free dna from many early tumors , suggesting its potential use for cancer screening . newline_char however , development of methods for noninvasive detection of early-stage tumors has remained a challenge . story_separator_special_tag the test scans blood for dna fragments released by cancerous tumors , explained lead researcher dr. newline_char by reviewing these dna fragments for mutations found in 58 " cancer-driver " genes , the blood test detects many early stage cancers without rendering false positives for healthy people , said velculescu , co-director of cancer biology at the johns hopkins kimmel cancer center , in baltimore . story_separator_special_tag chicago ( reuters ) - a test that scans blood for tumor-specific dna identified early-stage cancer in more than half of 138 patients with the disease , u.s. researchers reported on wednesday , marking a new milestone in the rush for so-called “ liquid biopsies. newline_char ” several companies already offer tests that can detect cancer dna in the blood of patients with late-stage cancers . newline_char researchers behind the early-stage test hope it could be used to identify cancers at a stage when patients have a better chance at survival . newline_char “ to our knowledge , this is one of the first studies that has looked directly at early-stage cancers , ” said dr victor velculescu , professor of oncology at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center , whose study was published in the journal science translational medicine .
