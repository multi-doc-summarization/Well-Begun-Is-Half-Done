e alaska senate race wo n't be officially decided until later this month—officials have to go through all the ballots , smoothing out the grizzly-bear tooth-marks and brushing off stray eagle feathers—but as of this morning , it looks like lisa murkowski has accomplished the unlikely feat of being elected as a write-in candidate . newline_char ms murkowski is the incumbent , but lost the republican primary this year to the tea-party candidate joe miller , who is pals with and was heavily promoted by sarah palin . newline_char the outcome wo n't affect the balance of power in the senate , but it is a blow to mrs palin , who presented herself as a political kingmaker this election season , with decidedly mixed results . newline_char this is her home state , she never stops talking about it , she used to be the governor of it , mr miller did get through the republican primary , the murkowski brand does have a lot of baggage in alaska and , for pete 's sake , ms murkowski had to run as a write-in . newline_char that her candidate lost is a measure of mrs palin 's own reduced standing in alaska . story_separator_special_tag sarah palin endorsed 60 candidates this year , but when dust settled wednesday morning , the biggest beneficiary of the “ sarah palin effect ” was not necessarily the candidates themselves , but the palin brand . newline_char of the 34 candidates palin endorsed for the house , only 15 won , a less-than-stellar average for someone vying to be the difference-maker in republican politics . newline_char but on the senate side , only five of her 12 choices were successful – with the most embarrassing stumble potentially being her home-state pick of joe miller , who is knotted with palin foe lisa murkowski in a tight battle that could end in a weeks-long recount .
