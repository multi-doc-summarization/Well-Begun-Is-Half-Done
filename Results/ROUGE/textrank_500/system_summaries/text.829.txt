ring israel 's 1982 invasion of lebanon , all of us living in besieged west beirut were aware that the israeli military was seeking to eliminate the leadership of the palestine liberation organization ( plo ) , and had no qualms about killing large numbers of civilians in the process . newline_char we knew this from the aerial bombardment of the area around beirut 's arab university , where the plo had many of its offices . newline_char toward the end of israel 's ten-week bombardment and siege of beirut , a building that housed refugees located several blocks from my home in the sanayeh neighborhood was entirely destroyed from the air , killing dozens . newline_char immediately after the attack , i surveyed the carnage with a friend . newline_char after leaving him to return home , i heard another huge explosion -- it was a car bomb , presumably set off close to the destroyed building in order to kill those trying to rescue survivors . newline_char my friend barely escaped with his life . newline_char this and other examples of the handiwork of the architects of the israeli invasion of lebanon , preeminent among whom was ariel sharon , failed to make it into most of the hagiographic coverage of the man 's passing in the american and israeli media . story_separator_special_tag correction : an earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that ariel sharon “ withdrew troops from southern lebanon. newline_char ” then-prime minister ehud barak withdrew israeli troops from southern lebanon in 2000 . newline_char even before the proclamation of the jewish state , israel found itself in a state of war that has never ended . newline_char this state of affairs produced two aspects of the israeli psyche : a hair-trigger response to security threats and an attitude toward the peace process both grudging and nostalgic .
