gadget does n't cite a specific person or anonymous source , but says it , " received hard evidence from within b & n ; that the nook is being discontinued , with sales to seemingly continue until stock is exhausted . newline_char " the " outfit " ( we assume that means barnes & noble ) is apparently " encouraging retail partners to not send out any 'bulk requests ' for the nook 3g , as there simply 'will not be sufficient quantities to fulfill those orders . newline_char " as we said , it 's a little hard to decipher what this means , but we should point out that engadget 's story about the nook color getting an update to android 2.2 and possibly blowing up if you rooted it ( installed custom android firmware ) ended up being just a tad off base . newline_char one thing worth pointing out is that it would seem odd for barnes & noble to discontinue the 3g/wi-fi version of the nook and tell customers they could only get the wi-fi-only version . newline_char the fact is , amazon offers both a 3g/wi-fi kindle and wi-fi-only kindle , and barnes & noble would most likely continue to offer models that compete with what amazon 's got . newline_char while barnes & noble remains heavily focused on marketing the nook color , the more likely scenario is for the company to refresh the nook e-ink line , which launched in november 2009 . story_separator_special_tag when it comes to ereaders , it looks like customers prefer to have a wifi-only model . newline_char despite barnes & noble 's nook product line showing all-time sales highs ( thanks in no small part to the uber-popular nook color ) , the e-ink nook 3g is apparently about to be discontinued , according to an engadget tipster .
