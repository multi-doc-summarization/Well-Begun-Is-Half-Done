 , 2015 - shorter mothers have shorter pregnancies , smaller babies , and higher risk for a preterm birth . newline_char new research has found that a mother 's height directly influences her risk for preterm birth . newline_char investigators at the march of dimes prematurity research center ohio collaborative looked at 3,485 nordic women and their babies , and found that maternal height , which is determined by genetic factors , helped shape the fetal environment , influencing the length of pregnancy and frequency of prematurity . newline_char more than 450,000 babies are born too soon in the u.s. and the national preterm birth rate is worse than many other high-resource countries , the march of dimes says . newline_char " a major goal of the nationwide network of march of dimes prematurity research centers is identifying genes that govern fetal growth and length of pregnancy . story_separator_special_tag summary of major findings while the extremes of birth size , particularly birth weight , and gestational age at birth are important global contributors to infant mortality , more modest deviations in these parameters have been repeatedly linked to risk for adult disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease [ 58â€“60 ] . newline_char thus , understanding the determinants of fetal growth and the duration of pregnancy are essential to improve both newborn and later-in-life health . newline_char moreover , should fetal genetics shape these outcomes , their direct involvement in the risk for the adult diseases , as well , is an intriguing possibility . newline_char in this study , we observed the consistent associations between maternal height and birth length , birth weight , and gestational age in each of the three study cohorts . newline_char the estimated effect sizes of the observed associations were respectively ~0.05 cm/cm for birth length , ~10 g/cm for birth weight , and ~0.34 d/cm for
