e thick have their needs , too michael bay ’ s ‘ pain & gain , ’ with mark wahlberg to describe “ pain & gain ” as a michael bay movie on steroids would be accurate but also redundant and a little misleading . newline_char bay ’ s specialty , after all , and while this grisly true-crime drama is partly about performance-enhancing drugs and the bulky men who love them , it is also , compared with “ armageddon ” or the “ transformers ” series , a stripped-down , modest enterprise in which no major american city is reduced to rubble . newline_char this is not to suggest that the film , written by christopher markus and stephen mcfeely and based on a series of articles by pete collins ( published in miami new times ) , is in any way subtle or restrained . newline_char mark wahlberg , running from the heavily armed forces of law and order , dashes across rooftops and lumbers , sometimes in slow motion , through streets and alleys . newline_char what follows is two hours of sweat , blood and cheerful , nasty vulgarity , punctuated by voice-over ruminations about jesus , physical fitness and the american dream , along with a few tactical visits to a strip club . newline_char collins ’ s deadpan chronicle of idiotic criminality and sloppy police work . newline_char wahlberg plays daniel lugo , a personal trainer and bodybuilding enthusiast who lands a job at a miami gym after serving time for an investment scam . story_separator_special_tag and johnson perfectly blends the two sides of his screen persona . newline_char always one-part supersized tough guy and two parts endearing family star , johnson finds the humor in a man roasting severed hands on a grill as much as he does the soul of a guy gripping tight to redemption in the midst of 'roid rage .
