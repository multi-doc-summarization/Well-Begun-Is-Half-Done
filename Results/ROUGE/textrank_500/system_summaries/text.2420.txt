inichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan , has tried to prove the abc conjecture , a long-standing pure maths problem , but now says fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work . newline_char the problem gets its name from the simple equation for adding two numbers , a + b = c , but poses deep questions about the true nature of numbers . newline_char in 2012 mochizuki posted a 500-page paper online that claimed to solve the puzzle , but it required a dense framework of new maths dubbed " inter-universal teichmüller theory " that even experienced mathematicians found difficult to follow . newline_char mochizuki is a highly-respected mathematician and his work is taken seriously , says minhyong kim of the university of oxford , but in the years since he posted the proof no one has been able to give a definitive answer on whether it is correct . newline_char now mochizuki has posted a new report describing his efforts to explain his theory to others . story_separator_special_tag shinichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan claims he has proven the abc conjecture , one of the longest standing mysteries of mathematics . newline_char however , even though his 500-page paper was published in 2012 , no one has managed to understand it . newline_char mochizuki says his fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work . newline_char in fact , the theory poses some significant questions about the actual nature of numbers , so truly understanding it would be highly significant for mathematics . newline_char in 2012 , he published a 500-page paper online that claimed to solve the puzzle . newline_char there were two problems however – the first one , that it ’ s a 500 page paper , and the
