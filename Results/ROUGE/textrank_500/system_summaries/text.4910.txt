r decades , physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes . newline_char the new calculation , which appears in the march issue of the journal , does n't merely add more detail about the structure of earth , he notes . story_separator_special_tag abstract this paper examines the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of earth as ascertained from seismic data . newline_char numerically , it is found that the time taken to fall along the diameter is 38 min , compared to 42 min for a planet with uniform density . newline_char the time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer independent of distance but interpolates between 42 min for short trips and 38 min for long trips . newline_char the brachistochrone path ( minimizing the time between any two points ) is similar in shape to the uniform-density solution but tends to reach a greater maximum depth and takes less time to traverse . story_separator_special_tag credit : nasa ( phys.org ) â€”alexander klotz a student at mcgill university in canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question , how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the earth ? newline_char he has published his reasoning , math and conclusions in a paper published in the american journal of physics . newline_char if someone were to drill a hole all the way through the planet , and then somehow manage to fall into it , how long would it take them to arrive on the other side ? newline_char that is a physics question put to students every year , and those who give it expect the answer to be 42 minutes . newline_char the accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into
