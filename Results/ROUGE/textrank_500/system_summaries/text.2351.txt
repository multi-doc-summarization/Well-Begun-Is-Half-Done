th its a350 xwb jet , airbus integrates the latest design and engineering tricks to quell many of the headaches for flyers , carriers , and pilots . newline_char " the design process was about optimization , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program at airbus , says . newline_char with $ 15 billion worth of research and development under its belt , airbus is hoping that its no-nonsense approach to design and engineering will help it best the competitionâ€”namely the boeing 787 dreamliner and 777 long-distance planes . story_separator_special_tag one of the biggest downsides to a long-haul flight - aside from being cooped up in a metal box for hours - is waiting for your body to readjust to the new time zone once you touch down . newline_char but commercial aircraft companies airbus and qatar airways think they might have found a solution to the perennial jetlag problem with their latest aeroplane . newline_char the a350 xwb comes with a variety of improvements designed to minimise that groggy feeling you get from flying halfway around the world . newline_char one of the main innovations is a system of led lights inside the cabin that are designed to change colour to mimic the sun 's natural glow - and they 're programmed to fit in with our bodies ' natural circadian rhythms no matter what the actual time is . newline_char what 's more , the plane 's filtering system refreshes the air inside the cabin every 2 or 3 minutes , and keeps it pressurised at the equivalent of an altitude of 1,828.8 metres ( 6,000 feet ) . newline_char again , airbus says this should improve comfort for passengers and minimise the effects of jetlag once they step back onto the ground .
