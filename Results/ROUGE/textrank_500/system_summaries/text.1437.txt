rizon plunges down the biggest rabbit-hole in history in search of the smallest thing in the universe . newline_char scientists hope to catch a glimpse of miniature black holes , multiple dimensions and even parallel universes . story_separator_special_tag one contender for the smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole . newline_char the answer to the enduring question of the smallest thing in the universe has evolved along with humanity . newline_char then the atom was discovered , and it was thought indivisible , until it was split to reveal protons , neutrons and electrons inside . newline_char these too , seemed like fundamental particles , before scientists discovered that protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each . newline_char " this time we have n't been able to see any evidence at all that there 's anything inside quarks , " said physicist andy parker . newline_char " and even if quarks and electrons are indivisible , parker said , scientists do n't know if they are the smallest bits of matter in existence , or if the universe contains objects that are even more minute . newline_char in experiments , teensy , tiny particles like quarks and electrons seem to act like single points of matter with no spatial distribution . newline_char but point-like objects complicate the laws of physics . newline_char because you can get infinitely close to a point , the forces acting on it can become infinitely large , and scientists hate infinities . newline_char the theory posits that all particles , instead of being point-like , are actually little loops of string . newline_char yet scientists still have no experimental evidence that string theory is correct . newline_char another way of solving the point problem is to say that space itself is n't continuous and smooth , but is actually made
