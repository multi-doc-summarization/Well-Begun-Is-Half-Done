stead , it seems , the shape of a person ’ s social network is a powerful signal that can identify one ’ s spouse or romantic partner — and even if a relationship is likely to break up . newline_char so says a new research paper written by jon kleinberg , a computer scientist at cornell university , and lars backstrom , a senior engineer at facebook . newline_char the pair used a hefty data set from facebook as their lab : 1.3 million facebook users , selected randomly from among all users who are at least 20 years old , with from 50 to 2,000 friends , who list a spouse or relationship partner in their profile . newline_char their key finding was that the total number of mutual friends two people share — embeddedness , in social networking terms — is actually a fairly weak indicator of romantic relationships . newline_char this yardstick measures mutual friends , but also friends from the further-flung reaches of a person ’ s network neighborhood . story_separator_special_tag but that 's not what researchers lars backstrom of facebook and jon kleinberg of cornell university found . newline_char here 's what that means : the number of mutual friends ( " embeddedness " ) is a reliable indicator of how close two people are . newline_char facebook data scientists have developed a novel method for identifying who among a user 's friends is that person 's partner—and their work puts an empirical stamp on something that is perhaps intuitive : a significant other occupies a unique place in a person 's social network , one characterized not by " embeddedness " —the standard way of measuring a tie 's proximity—but by what the researchers call " dispersion . newline_char " another measure fared much better : " dispersion , " or how many different networks of theirs a person 's friend shares .
