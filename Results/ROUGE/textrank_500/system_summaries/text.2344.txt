 andrew kornblatt while the ocean covers roughly 70 percent of our planet ’ s surface , we currently only have about 5-7 percent of that spectacularly large area mapped in any meaningful way . newline_char xprize , the non-profit foundation whose lofty mission is to “ design and manage public competitions ” that better mankind , has just launched a new ocean challenge which will likely draw the attention of marine scientists , geologists and hobbyists everywhere . newline_char $ 7,000,000 prize purse and the illustrious title of “ xprize winner ” , the competition is is likely to push the technologies that drive ocean exploration . newline_char these tasks include making a high-resolution map of the sea-floor , taking high-definition images of specific objects ,  story_separator_special_tag manned and automated efforts combined have only mapped a small percentage of them , prompting xprize and partners to offer $ 7 million for robotic exploration platforms . newline_char " our oceans cover two-thirds of our planet 's surface and are a crucial global source of food , energy , economic security , and even the air we breathe , yet 95 percent of the deep sea remains a mystery to us , " said xprize head peter diamandis in the the prize 's announcement . newline_char " teams ' creations will be tested first at 2,000 , then 4,000 meters ( about 6,500 and 13,000 feet , respectively ) , at which the robots will be required to create a high-resolution map , take snapshots of a given object and identify interesting features like shipwrecks or geological anomalies . newline_char the top prize is $ 4 million , with a chance to win an extra million if the robot manages to follow a chemical or biological signal back to its source .
