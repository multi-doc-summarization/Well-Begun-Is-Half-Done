christian charisius/european pressphoto agency ) a group of scientists says it has now reconstructed the history of the planet ’ s sea levels arcing back over some 3,000 years — leading it to conclude that the rate of increase experienced in the 20th century was “ extremely likely ” to have been faster than during nearly the entire period . newline_char “ we can say with 95 percent probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27  story_separator_special_tag abstract we present new sea-level reconstructions for the past 2100 y based on salt-marsh sedimentary sequences from the us atlantic coast . newline_char the data from north carolina reveal four phases of persistent sea-level change after correction for glacial isostatic adjustment . newline_char sea level then increased for 400 y at a rate of 0.6 mm/y , followed by a further period of stable , or slightly falling , sea level that persisted until the late 19th century . story_separator_special_tag yana kibyakova walks through a flooded street that was caused by the combination of the lunar orbit , which caused seasonal high tides , and what many believe is the rising sea levels due to climate change on sept. story_separator_special_tag we have known for a long time that sea level is rising . newline_char the link to sea level rise is clear . story_separator_special_tag significance we present the first , to our knowledge , estimate of global sea-level ( gsl ) change over the last ∼3,000 years that is based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions . newline_char the 20th century rise was extremely likely faster than during any of the 27 previous centuries . newline_char semiempirical modeling indicates that , without global warming , gsl in the 20th century very likely would have risen
