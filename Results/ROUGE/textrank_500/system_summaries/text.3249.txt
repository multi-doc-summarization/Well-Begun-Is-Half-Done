otos : noaa unveils 1st stunning images from goes-16 satellite by kevin byrne , accuweather staff writer february 08 , 2017 , 4:43:00 pm est the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) released the first high-resolution images that were sent from its newly-launched goes-16 , formerly goes-r , satellite on monday . newline_char called a " game changer " by noaa , the $ 1.2 billion satellite will help revolutionize weather forecasting in many ways , including sending back data faster and generating images in higher resolution that will lead to more accurate forecasts . newline_char the photos provides by goes-16 have an image resolution four times greater than the existing goes satellites . story_separator_special_tag jan 15 , 2017 with five-times greater coverage , four-times the spatial resolution , and three-times the spectral channels than earlier generations of goes-16 's advanced baseline imager can provide more detailed imagery and multi-task in ways that previous goes imagers could not . newline_char for proof of that , consider the following image comparing full-disk images captured by two noaa satellites -- goes-16 and goes-13 -- at the same time on the same day : 1:07 p.m. est on january 15 , 2017 . newline_char on the left is a color-composite full-disk image from noaa 's newest geostationary weather satellite goes-16 ( located at 89.5 degrees west longitude ) , which was created by combining data from the abi 's 16 spectral channels . newline_char by comparison , the imager aboard goes-13 has just five spectral channels , and their data can not be combined to produce color composites with this " true color " effect  story_separator_special_tag the pictures from its advanced baseline imager ( abi ) instrument , built by harris corporation , show a full-disc view of the western hemisphere in high detail â€” at four times the image resolution of existing goes spacecraft .
