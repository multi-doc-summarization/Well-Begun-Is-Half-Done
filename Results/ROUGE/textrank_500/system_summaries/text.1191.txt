 may 13 , in south carolina , the ap reports that a prison inmate , out for a hospital visit , attempted to escape by trying a gta-style driver-yank-and-carjack on a nearby car . newline_char things didn ’ t work out so well for 18-year old ezekiel stevenson , the wannabe carjacker , because the driver of the car had a tiny advantage : the key fob . newline_char i have a sort of love/hate relationship with proximity keys . newline_char well , mostly hate , if i ’ m honest . newline_char sure , they can be convenient , but all too often they manage to cause complicated issues and hassles that could so easily be resolved if the damn car just demanded to have a key jammed in it somewhere . newline_char this time , though , i have to admit a clear and unfettered victory for the proximity key . newline_char see , when stevenson dragged that unnamed guy out of his car , he had the key fob on him , so when the prison inmate tried to drive away , the car ’ s owner was able to shut down the car . newline_char with the car immobile , a standoff ensued , with stevenson attempting to lock the doors , but the owner just kept clicking the button on the fob and unlocking them , over and over , until police were able to enter the car . newline_char advertisement stevenson bolted into the woods , but was caught within the hour . newline_char if the car had used a conventional key , this all would have played out very differently . newline_char looks like i owe proximity keys a bit of an apology .
