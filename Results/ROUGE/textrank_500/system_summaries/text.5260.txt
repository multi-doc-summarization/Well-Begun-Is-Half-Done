e discovery of remains belonging to a new species of horse-sized dinosaur is shedding light on how tyrannosaurus rex ( t. newline_char the remains were unearthed in northern uzbekistan and are now said to be providing insights into how a family of small-bodied dinosaurs evolved over millions of years to become fearsome giants . newline_char the study shows the dinosaurs - known as tyrannosaurs - developed huge body sizes rapidly towards the end of the age of dinosaurs , and that their keen senses , which evolved earlier in much smaller species , enabled them to climb to the top of the prehistoric food chain . newline_char little has been known about how tyrannosaurs became the giant , intelligent predators that dominated the landscape about 66 million years ago . newline_char photo : todd marshall/university of edinburgh/pa scientists said the newly-discovered species , named timurlengia euotica , lived about 90 million years ago and the remains fill a 20-million-year gap in the fossil record of tyrannosaurs . story_separator_special_tag the iconic tyrannosaurus rex , the star of jurassic park , emerged as a huge and cunning predator some 80 million years ago . newline_char but how it evolved has long been a mystery , because of a gap in the fossil record that began 100 million years ago . newline_char now , new remains that include a skull fragment show that this dinosaur started out smaller , the size of a bear , and evolved its big brain before its huge stature . newline_char the first tyrannosaurs evolved about 170 million years ago , when they split from the group of feathered predators that later gave rise to birds . newline_char they emerged as giants during a 20-million-year gap in the fossil record , when the dinosaur age was coming to an end .
