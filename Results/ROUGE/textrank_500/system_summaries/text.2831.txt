cording to a fascinating new study led by columbia ’ s earth institute and published today the journal the cryosphere , which finds that greenland ’ s “ albedo , ” or reflectivity , has been decreasing since the mid 90s . story_separator_special_tag the surface energy balance and meltwater production of the greenland ice sheet ( gris ) are modulated by snow and ice albedo through the amount of absorbed solar radiation . newline_char here we show , using space-borne multispectral data collected during the 3 decades from 1981 to 2012 , that summertime surface albedo over the gris decreased at a statistically significant ( 99 % ) rate of 0.02decade−1 between 1996 and 2012 . story_separator_special_tag greenland 's ice is getting darker , increasing risk of melting feedback loops from melting itself are driving changes in reflectivity greenland 's snowy surface has been getting darker over the past two decades , absorbing more heat from the sun and increasing snow melt , a new study of satellite data shows . newline_char that trend is likely to continue , with the surface 's reflectivity , or albedo , decreasing by as much as 10 percent by the end of the century , the study says . story_separator_special_tag in a study that used satellite images stretching back decades , scientists have delved into the processes causing 'darkening ' of the greenland ice sheet – its diminishing ability to reflect the sun 's radiation . newline_char greenland ’ s ice sheet has been darkening for the past two decades , and new research delves into the processes behind this phenomenon . newline_char the study , published thursday in the cryosphere , a journal of the european geosciences union , considers the processes by which an ice sheet loses its ability
