guably the world ’ s most famous painting , da vinci 's mona lisa has now been copied onto the world ’ s smallest canvas at the georgia institute of technology . newline_char associate professor jennifer curtis ' " mini lisa " is one-third the width of a human hair , with details as small as one-eighth of a micron . newline_char mini lisa demonstrates the flexibility of a new nanolithography technique that can vary the surface concentration of molecules on very small portions of a substrate . newline_char mini lisa was rendered using an atomic force microscope and a new process called thermochemical nanolithography ( tcnl ) . newline_char the heat of the cantilever triggers a confined nanoscale chemical reaction , in which more heat produces a greater local concentration of new surface molecules . newline_char more heat produced the lighter shades of gray , as seen on the mini lisa ’ s forehead and hands . newline_char less heat produced the darker shades in her dress and hair seen when the molecular canvas is visualized using fluorescent dye . story_separator_special_tag researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created a reproduction of the 'mona lisa ' that is no wider than a third of the width of a human hair . newline_char north korea missile launch toward s. newline_char korea failed . newline_char georgia tech researchers have created the " mini lisa " on a substrate surface approximately 30 microns in width . newline_char the image demonstrates a technique that could potentially be used to achieve nano-manufacturing of devices because the team was able to vary the surface concentration of molecules on such short length scales . newline_char but even this minuscule masterpiece looks huge next to what researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created .
