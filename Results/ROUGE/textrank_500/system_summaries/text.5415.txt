can ’ t express how relieved i was to see that “ rocky 7 , ” or as it is officially titled , “ creed , ” is not the film that the marketing department promised us . newline_char “ creed ” follows the themes and gambits of classic fight films but this is no paint-by-numbers imitation . newline_char the prologue showing the hard-knocks life of brawling preteen adonis johnson creed suggests he might have the menace of a clubber lang . newline_char the out-of-wedlock , essentially abandoned child of the late champ apollo creed , adonis grows up shadow boxing to share his iconic father ’ s limelight . newline_char jordan ( as compelling here as he was in director ryan coogler ’ s previous film “ fruitvale station ” ) infuses considerable depth to the essentially likable character . newline_char adonis has a combative hair trigger , but he ’ s conflicted about fighting , at times reluctant to commit to the sport that killed his dad . newline_char who could be a better mentor than rocky balboa , the patron saint of philadelphia ? story_separator_special_tag adonis johnson creed ( michael b. newline_char jordan ) , the son of former heavyweight champion apollo creed , attempts to follow in his father 's footsteps and become a boxing legend in his own right . newline_char apollo died in the ring in the 1980s at the hand of russian pugilist ivan drago , forcing adonis to grow up without his dad in his life . newline_char the young man travels to philadelphia to find his late father 's nemesis-turned-best friend , rocky balboa ( sylvester stallone ) , in order to recruit him as a trainer . newline_char balboa soon takes the young creed under his wing and helps him get in shape for a shot at the title .
