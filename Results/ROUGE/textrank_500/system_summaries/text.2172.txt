perimental compound reverses down syndrome-like learning deficits in mice contact information available for logged-in reporters only citations science translational medicine ; r01 hd38384 ; mh51106 ; r01 ns39156 newswise — researchers at johns hopkins and the national institutes of health have identified a compound that dramatically bolsters learning and memory when given to mice with a down syndrome-like condition on the day of birth . newline_char 4 issue of science translational medicine , the single-dose treatment appears to enable the cerebellum of the rodents ’ brains to grow to a normal size . story_separator_special_tag there is no cure for down syndrome , which is caused by the presence of an additional chromosome , leading to extra copies of more than 300 genes and causing intellectual disabilities , distinctive facial features and sometimes other health problems . newline_char the team at johns hopkins university used lab mice that were genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half the genes found on human chromosome 21 , leading to down syndrome-like conditions such as smaller brains and difficulty learning to navigate a maze . story_separator_special_tag scientists have taken another step forward when it comes to treating down syndrome . newline_char they 've discovered a compound that dramatically bolsters learning and memory in mice that have had down syndrome-like symptoms since birth . newline_char they 've discovered a compound that dramatically bolsters learning and memory in mice that have had down syndrome-like symptoms since birth . newline_char like us on facebook down syndrome is a condition that occurs when people have three , rather than the usual two , copies of chromosome 21 . newline_char as a result of this , people with down syndrome have extra copies of the more than 300 genes that are housed on that chromosome .
