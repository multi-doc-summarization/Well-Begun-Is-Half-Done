rnell ’ s mustached bat ( pteronotus parnellii ) is native to north , south , and central america . newline_char parnell ’ s mustached bat can have a wingspan of up to 1.9 feet and bears squat , pointed ears . newline_char parnell ’ s mustached bat appears on the iucn red list with a conservation status of “ least concern ”  story_separator_special_tag a prominent hypothesis of hemispheric specialization for human speech and music states that the left and right auditory cortices ( acs ) are respectively specialized for precise calculation of two canonically-conjugate variables : time and frequency . newline_char this spectral-temporal asymmetry does not account for sex , brain-volume , or handedness , and is in opposition to closed-system hypotheses that restrict this asymmetry to humans . newline_char mustached bats have smaller brains , but greater ethological pressures to develop such a spectral-temporal asymmetry , than humans . newline_char , the mathematical basis of the spectral-temporal asymmetry ) to frame mustached bat literature , we show that recent findings in bat ac ( 1 ) support the notion that hemispheric specialization for speech and  story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag washington -- researchers from georgetown university medical center and american university have shown that , like humans , mustached bats use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds . newline_char aside from humans , no other animal that has been studied , not even monkeys or apes , has proved to use such hemispheric specialization for sound processing -- meaning that the left brain is better at processing fast sounds , and the right processing slow ones . newline_char the scientists say their study , published in frontiers of neuroscience , opens a pathway to studying bat brains in order to understand certain human language disorders and potentially even improving computer speech recognition .
