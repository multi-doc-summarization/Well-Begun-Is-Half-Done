edit : nasa sydney : water originating from solar winds has been found in the moon ’ s soil , u.s. researchers have announced . newline_char water on the moon is not a new discovery – there are known sources in craters at the polar regions – but this finding has revealed a new source : the solar winds . newline_char in a report published in nature geoscience , researchers claimed that hydrogen ejected from the sun ’ s atmosphere is carried in solar winds and implanted in the lunar soil , where it reacts with oxygen already present on the moon ’ s surface . newline_char colonising the moon the finding could be a useful resource for future human settlement on the moon , according to yang liu from the university of tennessee , lead author of the paper . newline_char “ now we have ready sources of water that can not only be consumed by plants and humans , but also electrolysed into its constituent elements – hydrogen and oxygen – to make rocket fuel , ” she said . newline_char however , geochemist ross taylor from the australian academy of science , who was not involved in the research , said harvesting water from lunar soil would be complicated and using it for human settlement probably unrealistic . story_separator_special_tag glass beads within moon rocks suggest that water seen on the lunar surface originates from the solar wind , researchers say . newline_char " [ gallery : our changing moon ] " this water would be of most value as rocket fuel — liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen , " liu added . newline_char " until the recent discovery of water in and on the moon , this was going to be a very energy-intensive endeavor to separate these elements from the lunar rocks and soil .
