1,112-y tree-ring record of moisture shows that in opposition to conventional wisdom , the climate during the rise of the 13 th -century mongol empire was a period of persistent moisture , unprecedented in the last 1,000 y . newline_char this 15-y episode of persistent moisture likely led to a period of high grassland productivity , contributing fuel to the mongol empire . newline_char although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests , no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the mongol empire . newline_char here we present a 1,112-y tree-ring reconstruction of warm-season water balance derived from siberian pine ( pinus sibirica ) trees in central mongolia . newline_char our reconstruction accounts for 56 % of the variability in the regional water balance and is significantly correlated with steppe productivity across central mongolia . newline_char in combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction , our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of chinggis khan  story_separator_special_tag american researchers studying the rings of ancient trees in central mongolia have discovered that his rise coincided with the mildest , wettest weather in more than 1,000 years . newline_char charismatic leader the research shows that the years before genghis khan 's rule were characterised by severe drought from 1180 to 1190 , the study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences said . newline_char image caption present-day mongolians regard genghis khan as the founding father of their country but as the empire expanded from from 1211 to 1225 , mongolia saw an unusual spell of regular rainfall and mild temperatures . newline_char " the transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events , " study co-author and west virginia university tree-ring scientist amy hessl told the afp news agency .
