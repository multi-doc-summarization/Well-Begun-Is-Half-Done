stract background : nut intake has been associated with lower mortality , but few studies have investigated causes of death other than cardiovascular disease , and dose-response relationships remain unclear . newline_char methods : we investigated the relationship of nut ( tree nut , peanut ) and peanut butter intake with overall and cause-specific mortality . newline_char in the netherlands cohort study , 120 852 men and women aged 55â€“69 years provided information on dietary and lifestyle habits in 1986 . newline_char results : total nut intake was related to lower overall and cause-specific mortality ( cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular , respiratory , neurodegenerative diseases , other causes ) in men and women . story_separator_special_tag we switched to low-fat foods . newline_char you may wonder is n't fat bad for you , but your body needs some fat from food . story_separator_special_tag daily consumption of nuts and peanuts linked to lower mortality rates 11 june 2015 nuts and peanuts , but not peanut butter , may protect against death from cancer , heart disease , respiratory disease and other major causes , new study finds a paper published today in the international journal of epidemiology confirms a link between peanut and nut intake and lower mortality rates , but finds no protective effect for peanut butter . newline_char men and women who eat at least 10 grams of nuts or peanuts per day have a lower risk of dying from several major causes of death than people who do n't consume nuts or peanuts . newline_char the reduction in mortality was strongest for respiratory disease , neurodegenerative disease and diabetes , followed by cancer and cardiovascular diseases . newline_char peanuts show at least as strong reductions in mortality as tree nuts , but peanut butter is not associated with mortality , researchers
