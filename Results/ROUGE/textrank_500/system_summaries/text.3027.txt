t some of our earliest ancestors—including the microbial eve from which all modern cells descended—left behind traces in the genes they passed to their descendants . newline_char now , researchers report that they ’ ve used this sort of genome mining to reveal new insights about the daily life of our last universal common ancestor , or luca . newline_char the results suggest that luca was a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen , bolstering strong suspicions that life on earth formed in and around hydrothermal vents such as those found near undersea volcanoes . newline_char today , the cells that make up all life on earth are clustered into three broad groups : bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes . story_separator_special_tag the concept of a last universal common ancestor of all cells ( luca , or the progenote ) is central to the study of early evolution and life 's origin , yet information about how and where luca lived is lacking . newline_char we investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of luca . story_separator_special_tag a surprisingly specific genetic portrait of the ancestor of all living things has been generated by scientists who say that the likeness sheds considerable light on the mystery of how life first emerged on earth . newline_char this venerable ancestor was a single-cell , bacterium-like organism . newline_char it is known as luca , the last universal common ancestor , and is estimated to have lived some four billion years ago , when earth was a mere 560 million years old . newline_char the nature of the earliest ancestor of all living things has long been uncertain because the three great domains of life seemed to have
