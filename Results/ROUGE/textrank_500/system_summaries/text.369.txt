ltimore , june 2 ( upi ) -- a discrepancy between galactic distances in the infant universe and more modern measurements suggests the universe is expanding at a faster pace than previously predicted . newline_char the numbers suggest the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe , just after the big bang . story_separator_special_tag according to new research , soon to be published in the astrophysical journal , the rate of expansion , or the hubble constant , is about 73.24 kilometers per second per megaparsec ( a unit equivalent to 3.26 million light-years ) : somewhere between five and nine percent faster than we thought . story_separator_special_tag astronomers using nasa 's hubble space telescope have discovered that the universe is expanding 5 percent to 9 percent faster than expected . newline_char " this surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " said study leader and nobel laureate adam riess of the space telescope science institute and the johns hopkins university , both in baltimore , maryland . story_separator_special_tag measurements taken by hubble space telescope conflict with studies of radiation left over from big bang – fuelling theories of ‘ dark energy ’ and mystery particles the universe is expanding faster than anyone had previously measured or calculated from theory . story_separator_special_tag that ’ s according to new , highly precise measurements of the distance between 19 faraway galaxies acquired by the hubble space telescope . newline_char the new numbers indicate that the rate of expansion of our universe ( the so-called “ hubble constant ” ) is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec .
