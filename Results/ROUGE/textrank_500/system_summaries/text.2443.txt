 the editor : re “ donald trump gets weirder , ” by gail collins ( column , april 2 ) : even before gail collins was with the new york times , she has written nasty and derogatory articles about me . newline_char collins in that she has survived so long with so little talent . newline_char her storytelling ability and word usage ( coming from me , who has written many best sellers ) , is not at a very high level . newline_char there is a very large segment of our society who believe that barack obama , indeed , was not born in the united states . story_separator_special_tag “ that first book was total genius and helped get him elected , ” trump continued . newline_char “ but you can tell obama did the second book himself because it read like it was written by somebody of average intelligence with a high school education. newline_char ” did i mention that , in his letter , trump complained about my calling him a “ birther ” because the word was “ very derogatory and meant in a derogatory way ” ? newline_char obama , of course , graduated from columbia university and harvard law school — if you can believe columbia and harvard law . newline_char i have people that actually have been studying it , and they can not believe what they ’ re finding , ” trump announced on “ today . newline_char ” photo trump does not actually seem to have people studying , or even  story_separator_special_tag vote for donald trump , the man who can make bill o ’ reilly look like the most sensible guy in the room . newline_char trump ’ s main argument for why he should be taken seriously as a presidential contender is his business success . newline_char has obama ever hosted a long-running reality series ?
