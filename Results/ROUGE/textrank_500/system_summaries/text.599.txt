 dennis prager - december 24 , 2013 as a jew , and a religious one at that , i want to wish my fellow americans a merry christmas . newline_char " merry christmas . newline_char i write , " my fellow americans " because , as reported by the pew research poll released just last wednesday , nine in 10 americans say they celebrate christmas . newline_char apparently , many americans have forgotten that christmas is not only a christian holy day , but also an american national holiday . newline_char just as we wish one another a " happy thanksgiving " or a " happy fourth , " so , too , we should wish fellow americans a " merry christmas . newline_char that is why some of the most famous and beloved christmas songs were written by guess who ? newline_char jews . newline_char " white christmas " was written by irving berlin ( birth name : israel isidore baline ) . story_separator_special_tag second , it ’ s okay for jews to celebrate christmas . newline_char for many people , christmas is more about santa than jesus anyway ( at least in my secular book . newline_char ) and while we ’ re all arguing about whether santa is black or white , why not consider the possibility that he might be jewish , right megyn kelly ? newline_char more : jesus wasn ’ t white , but santa definitely is besides , if santa were jewish , he wouldn ’ t be the only jew in the christmas pantheon . newline_char jesus , mary , and joseph were all jewish . newline_char what ’ s wrong with celebrating the birthday of the most famous jew ever to walk the earth ? newline_char besides , tons of jews
