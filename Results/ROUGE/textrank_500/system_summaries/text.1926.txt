laria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite . newline_char left untreated , they may develop severe complications and die . newline_char in 2016 an estimated 216 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 445,000 people died , mostly children in the african region . newline_char the vast majority of cases in the united states are in travelers and immigrants returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs , many from sub-saharan africa and south asia . story_separator_special_tag we report that during a recent period of hybridization between two major african malaria mosquitoes , anopheles gambiae and anopheles coluzzii , an island of divergence on chromosome 2 introgressed from the a. newline_char this introgression was coincident with the start of a major insecticide-treated bed net campaigns in mali . newline_char these observations suggest that increased insecticide exposure acted as a selective force sufficient to drive introgression of an entire genomic island of divergence across the reproductive barrier separating these two species . story_separator_special_tag an estimated 3.3 billion people are at risk of malaria , of whom 1.2 billion are at high risk . newline_char in high-risk areas , more than one malaria case occurs per 1000 population . newline_char disease burden in 2013 there were an estimated 198 million cases of malaria worldwide ( range 124–283 million ) in 2013 , and an estimated 584 000 deaths ( range 367 000–755 000 ) . newline_char 90 % of all malaria deaths occur in africa . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag interbreeding of two malaria mosquito species in the west african country of mali has resulted in a " super mosquito " hybrid that 's resistant to insecticide-treated bed nets . newline_char " it 's 'super ' with respect to its ability to survive exposure to the insecticides on treated bed nets , " said medical entomologist gregory lanzaro of uc davis , who led the research team .
