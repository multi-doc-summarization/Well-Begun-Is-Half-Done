litary members , retirees and veterans have a few more reasons to be wary of politicians who say their top priority is to cut federal spending . newline_char more than a few of the cbo options are fresh ideas to roll back compensation for categories of veterans or to raise tricare fees for military retirees , on suggestions that the government is being too generous . newline_char here are some of those ideas : cap military pay raises – from 2000 through 2010 , congress approved basic pay raises that averaged a half percentage point above private sector wage growth . newline_char the military could save $ 25 billion from 2015 to 2023 by reversing course , capping raises yearly at .5 percent below civilian wage growth . newline_char evidence in favor of this move are data showing cash compensation for enlisted members now exceeds wages of 90 percent of civilian counterparts , well above the defense department 's goal of keeping service pay ahead of 70 percent of civilians of similar age and educational background . newline_char cbo says officer compensation exceeds 86 percent of private sector peers . newline_char the case against capping raises is that recruiting and retention goals could be compromised , cbo says , and smaller raises also dampen other elements of military compensation including retirement annuities . newline_char raise tricare fees – cbo floats two options to have military retirees pay more for health care . newline_char one is to have tricare-for-life users -- retirees , spouses and survivors age 65 and older -- pay the first $ 550 of costs not covered by medicare and then 50 percent of the next $ 4950 . newline_char cbo says this would slow tricare costs by $ 31 billion from 2015 to 2023  story_separator_special_tag
