fossil of a trilobite , a horsecrab-like creature that thrived in the seas for hundreds of millions of years before becoming one of many kinds of animals wiped out in a mass extinction that befell the planet 252 million years ago , is shown in this handout photo provided by the university of chicago march 31 , 2014 . newline_char reuters/dan dry/university of chicago/handout via reuters a microbe that spewed humongous amounts of methane into earth ’ s atmosphere triggered a global catastrophe 252 million years ago that wiped out upwards of 90 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land vertebrates . newline_char that ’ s the hypothesis offered on monday by researchers aiming to solve one of science ’ s enduring mysteries : what happened at the end of the permian period to cause the worst of the five mass extinctions in earth ’ s history . story_separator_special_tag climate-changing microbes may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history 252m years ago , scientists believe . newline_char volcanic eruptions had previously been blamed for the sudden loss of 90 % of all species on earth at the end of the permian era . story_separator_special_tag the worst time to be alive in earth 's history is absolutely the end-permian , about 250 million years ago . newline_char the end-permian extinction has generally been blamed on massive volcanic eruptions that took place at the same time . newline_char but now in a new analysis , researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology argue that the mass extinction event may have been instigated by microbes . newline_char the shocks wiped out species in great numbers over a period of tens of thousands of years—a blip on geological scales . newline_char the end-permian extinction , which took place about 250 million years ago , is the most severe of five known mass extinction events
