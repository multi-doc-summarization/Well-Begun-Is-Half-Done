 it 's good to be reminded now and then of all the structured data that has become available thanks to their efforts : this looks pretty neat , especially since wikidata currently has over 947 million triples in their data store . newline_char since battles usually have a place and a date , it would be nice to import this data into a data design in nodegoat and visualise these battles through time and space ( diachronic geospatiality ftw ) . newline_char this query does not take into account that the location may be stored on a deeper level ( as these battles may have a ‘ place ’ that has a location ) and that the date may be stored as a ‘ start time ’ and ‘ end time ’ . newline_char to take this into account , we use the following query : prefix wd : < http : //www.wikidata.org/entity/ > prefix wdt : < http : //www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/ > prefix rdfs : < http : //www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema # > select ? newline_char coordinates ( concat ( str ( day ( ? newline_char date ) ) , " - " , str ( month ( ? newline_char date ) ) , " - " , str ( year ( ? newline_char displaydate ) ( concat ( str ( day ( ? newline_char start ) ) , " - " , str ( month ( ? newline_char start ) ) , " - " , str ( year ( ? newline_char displaystart ) ( concat ( str ( day ( ? newline_char end ) ) , " - " , str ( month ( ? newline_char end ) ) , " - " , str ( year ( ? newline_char subject wdt : p31 wd : q178561 . newline_char subject rdfs : label ? story_separator_special_tag
