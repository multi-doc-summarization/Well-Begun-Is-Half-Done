tory_separator_special_tag the ainsworth strange situation test ( sst ) has been widely used to demonstrate that the bond between both children and dogs to their primary carer typically meets the requirements of a secure attachment ( i.e . newline_char the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments ) , and has been adapted for cats with a similar claim made . newline_char however methodological problems in this latter research make the claim that the cat-owner bond is typically a secure attachment , operationally definable by its behaviour in the sst , questionable . newline_char a cross-over design experiment with 20 cat-owner pairs ( 10 each undertaking one of the two versions of the sst first ) and continuous focal sampling was used to record the duration of a range of behavioural states expressed by the cats that might be useful for assessing secure attachment . newline_char although cats vocalised more when the owner rather the stranger left the cat with the other individual , there was no other evidence consistent with the interpretation of the bond between a cat and its owner meeting the requirements of a secure attachment .
