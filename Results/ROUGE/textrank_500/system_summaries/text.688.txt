 's long been assumed that yawning delivers a fresh supply of oxygen to the brain to help us wake up , but studies have been unable to show an increase in blood oxygen levels after yawning . newline_char now austrian researchers have found that yawning actually works to manage brain temperature to improve alertness and mental efficiency . newline_char we tend to yawn when we are tired , stressed or under-stimulated , which are all factors that can alter the temperature of the brain , and the university of vienna researchers tested whether air temperature could influence how much we yawn . story_separator_special_tag however , previous research has failed to show an association between yawning and blood oxygen levels . newline_char sleep cycles , cortical arousal and stress are all associated with fluctuations in brain temperature , yawning subsequently functions to keep the brain temperature balanced and in optimal homeostasis . newline_char according to this theory , yawning should also be easily manipulated by ambient temperature variation , since exchange with cool ambient air temperature may facilitate lowering brain temperature . story_separator_special_tag previous research shows that yawn frequency diminishes as ambient temperatures rise and approach body temperature , but a lower bound to the thermal window has not been demonstrated . newline_char to test this , a total of 120 pedestrians were sampled for susceptibly to self-reported yawn contagion during distinct temperature ranges and seasons ( winter : 1.4 Â°c , n = 60 ; summer  story_separator_special_tag you 're actually yawning because your brain is too hot . newline_char a group of researchers at the university of vienna tested subjects in austria and arizona and tracked their activity , finding that that the only significant predicator of yawning was temperature : subjects were much more likely to yawn at higher temperatures .
