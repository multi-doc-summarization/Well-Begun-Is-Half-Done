 an event that occurs once every 11 years , the magnetic field of the sun will change its polarity in a matter of months , according new observations by nasa-supported observatories . newline_char the flipping of the sun 's magnetic field marks the peak of the star 's 11-year solar cycle and the halfway point in the sun 's " solar maximum " â€” the peak of its solar weather cycle . newline_char nasa released a new video describing the sun 's magnetic flip on monday ( aug. newline_char " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , the director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement . newline_char earth orbits the sun , dipping in and out of the waves of the current sheet . story_separator_special_tag the sun 's magnetic field is about to do a 180 when the celestial body 's electromagnetism flips and changes polarity . newline_char according to nasa-supported observations , the complete reversal is expected to take place in the coming months . newline_char " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , a solar physicist and director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement released by the agency . newline_char while the field reversal is a big event for the solar system , the change in polarity is rather routine . newline_char the magnetic flip takes place at the peak of each solar cycle every 11 years . newline_char the change in polarity will have certain effects throughout the heliosphere -- the sun 's domain , which extends well beyond pluto -- but , as nasa notes in its sciencecasts video , one of the largest effects earth can expect is some stormy space weather around the planet .
