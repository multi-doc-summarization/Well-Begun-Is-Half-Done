stract to discover interordinal relationships of living and fossil placental mammals and the time of origin of placentals relative to the cretaceous-paleogene ( k-pg ) boundary , we scored 4541 phenomic characters de novo for 86 fossil and living species . newline_char combining these data with molecular sequences , we obtained a phylogenetic tree that , when calibrated with fossils , shows that crown clade placentalia and placental orders originated after the k-pg boundary . story_separator_special_tag humankind ’ s common ancestor with other mammals may have been a roughly rat-size animal that weighed no more than a half a pound , had a long furry tail and lived on insects . newline_char in a comprehensive six-year study of the mammalian family tree , scientists have identified and reconstructed what they say is the most likely common ancestor of the many species on the most abundant and diverse branch of that tree — the branch of creatures that nourish their young in utero through a placenta . newline_char the work appears to support the view that in the global extinctions some 66 million years ago , all non-avian dinosaurs had to die for mammals to flourish . story_separator_special_tag in a paper published this week in the journal science , an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data , as well as dna evidence , to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals . newline_char the scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago — a concept at odds with some current thinking . newline_char " this is fairly novel , to reconstruct an ancestor , " said study coauthor and paleontologist mike novacek , the provost of science at the american museum of natural history
