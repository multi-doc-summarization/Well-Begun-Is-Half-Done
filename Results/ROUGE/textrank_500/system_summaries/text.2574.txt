em cell therapy creates heart cells capable of partially repairing damage to the organ , although more work needed before human trials can take place scientists have taken a step towards a radical new treatment for heart attacks with a stem cell therapy that can partially repair damage to the organ . newline_char tests in monkeys showed that injections of freshly-made heart cells were quickly incorporated into damaged areas of the heart and helped the organ to pump more vigorously . newline_char stem cell trial suggests damaged heart tissue could be regenerated read more but monkeys that had the procedure also developed unusual heart rhythms , leading the researchers to concede that far more work is needed before the treatment can be considered safe enough for human trials . newline_char heart attacks are one of the leading causes of death in the developed world . newline_char while 70 % of patients survive , many are left with tissue damage that stops their hearts from working properly . newline_char the hope is that , when injected into the heart , these cells take hold and help  story_separator_special_tag as plaque builds up in the arteries of a person with heart disease , the inside of the arteries begins to narrow , which lessens or blocks the flow of blood . newline_char heart disease in the united states about 610,000 people die of heart disease in the united states every year–that ’ s 1 in every 4 deaths . newline_char 1 die of heart disease in the united states every year–that ’ s . newline_char heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women . newline_char more than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men . newline_char 1 of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men . newline_char every year about 735,000 americans have a heart attack .
