 experiments involving a simulation of the human esophagus and stomach , researchers at mit , the university of sheffield , and the tokyo institute of technology have demonstrated a tiny origami robot that can unfold itself from a swallowed capsule and , steered by external magnetic fields , crawl across the stomach wall to remove a swallowed button battery or patch a wound . newline_char the new work , which the researchers are presenting this week at the international conference on robotics and automation , builds on a long sequence of papers on origami robots from the research group of daniela rus , the andrew and erna viterbi professor in mit ’ s department of electrical engineering and computer science . newline_char “ it ’ s really exciting to see our small origami robots doing something with potential important applications to health care , � ? story_separator_special_tag researchers from mit have designed a new ingestible " robot " that could one day be used to patch internal wounds , deliver medicine , or remove accidentally swallowed objects from the stomach . newline_char daniela rus , the director of mit ’ s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory ( csail ) and co-creator of bot , said it could be useful in health care one day . story_separator_special_tag once swallowed , it can open up inside a person 's stomach , crawling across the stomach wall to retrieve a single-cell button battery , and even patch wounds . newline_char developed by an international team of researchers from mit , the university of sheffield in the uk and the tokyo institute of technology in japan , the origami robot is the latest developed by mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory director daniela rus , who has been building and researching origami robots for
