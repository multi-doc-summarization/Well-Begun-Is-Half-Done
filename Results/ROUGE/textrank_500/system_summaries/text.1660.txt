ring charles darwin ’ s journey to the galápagos in the 1830s , he noted the existence of “ a curious group of finches ” found only on the islands . newline_char now , research suggests that at least some of darwin ’ s famous finches might soon be driven to extinction by parasitic flies introduced to them by humans in the 1960s . newline_char a paper published this week in the journal of applied ecology blames the parasitic nest fly philornis downsi for the threat to geospitza fortis , also known as the medium ground finch . newline_char downsi flies are not themselves parasitic , they lay their eggs in bird nests . newline_char the eggs hatch into maggots , which feed on both brooding adult finches and their babies . newline_char p. downsi kills huge numbers of baby birds among darwin ’ s finches and other land birds . story_separator_special_tag an even more compelling mystery concerns a common sight in springtime—bright blue eggs in a robin ’ s nest . newline_char they stand out from both the nest and the parent birds , so why are they bright blue ? newline_char biologists do know that pigment glands in the mother bird ’ s body deposit the blue coloration onto the eggs , so it must have a critical function . newline_char perhaps the dark color camouflages the eggs when the eggs are at the bottom of a dark nest , or the blue might blend in with the sky for some viewers . newline_char some researchers have even speculated that the striking color helps mother birds to find their own eggs . newline_char for now , however , the case of the mysteriously blue robin ’ s egg has yet to be cracked . newline_char in this case , the teaser could be : which came first , the egg color and pattern , or the choice of nesting site ?
