vid leonhardt reports on a new study that says it ’ s republicans : among married people between the ages of 20 and 60 , 67 percent of republicans report being “ very happy ” with their marriages….that gap shrank when the researchers factored in demographic differences between parties….but the gap did not disappear . newline_char even among people with the same demographic profile , republicans are slightly more likely than democrats to say they are happily married . story_separator_special_tag bradford wilcox , a sociologist , has written two recent papers noting that children in conservative parts of the country are more likely to grow up with both parents than in liberal ones . newline_char in both articles , he challenged the view that blue states are more conducive to stable family life than red states . newline_char and he argues this data continues to support his case that the so-called blue-state family model is overrated . story_separator_special_tag blue families are stronger and more stable than red families . newline_char at least at the regional level , blue families—that is , families in areas that vote democratic in presidential elections—do not have an advantage . newline_char it turns out that , on average , more conservative counties across the country have more marriage , less nonmarital childbearing , and more family stability for their children than do more liberal counties . story_separator_special_tag red america , the argument goes , is more likely to embrace outmoded views about sex , gender , and marriage that are ill suited to the new economy and the more egalitarian world that we now live in . newline_char by contrast , blue america emphasizes education , delayed parenthood , and gender egalitarianism , all values that are supposed to equip its citizens to build comparatively stronger and more stable families in twenty-first-century
