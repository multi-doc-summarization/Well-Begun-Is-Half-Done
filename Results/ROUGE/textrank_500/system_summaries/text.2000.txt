e discovery spawned a number of hypotheses about the effects these genetic variants may have on the physical characteristics or behavior of modern humans , ranging from skin color to heightened allergies to fat metabolism…generating dozens of colorful headlines including “ what your neanderthal dna is doing for you ” and “ neanderthals are to blame for our allergies ” and “ did europeans get fat from neanderthals ? newline_char ” now , the first study that directly compares neanderthal dna in the genomes of a significant population of adults of european ancestry with their clinical records confirms that this archaic genetic legacy has a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology . newline_char “ our main finding is that neanderthal dna does influence clinical traits in modern humans : we discovered associations between neanderthal dna and a wide range of traits , including immunological , dermatological , neurological , psychiatric and reproductive diseases , ” said john capra , senior author of the paper “ the phenotypic legacy of admixture between modern humans and neanderthals ” published in the feb. newline_char the new analysis found neanderthal dna variants influence skin biology in modern humans , in particular the risk of developing sun-induced skin lesions called keratosis , which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes . newline_char they also found a number of variants that influence the risk for depression : some positively and some negatively . newline_char in fact , a surprisingly number of snippets of neanderthal dna were associated with psychiatric and neurological effects , the study found . story_separator_special_tag note : we only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it , and that it is not junk mail . newline_char we do not capture any email address .
