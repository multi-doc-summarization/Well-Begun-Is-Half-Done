ick image above to view graphic although the prospect of a pill for alzheimer 's remains a long way off , the landmark british study provides a major new pathway for future drug treatments . newline_char the compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases , which shuts down the production of essential proteins , leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off . newline_char it was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as alzheimer 's or parkinson 's . newline_char the study , published today in the journal science translational medicine , was carried out at the medical research council 's ( mrc ) toxicology unit at the university of leicester . newline_char the fact that this is a compound that can be given orally , that gets into the brain and prevents brain disease , is a first in itselfâ€¦ we can go forward and develop better molecules and i ca n't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice . story_separator_special_tag scientists are hailing a landmark british study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's by stopping the death of neurons . newline_char the medical research council ( mrc ) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres . newline_char but this research , published in the journal science translational medicine , targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins . newline_char during the study , a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice .
