riants of apolipoprotein e have been studied extensively as risk factors for many different conditions . newline_char for example , apoe alleles have been shown to influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases . newline_char people who carry at least one copy of the apoe e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis , which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries . newline_char the apoe e2 allele has been shown to greatly increase the risk of a rare condition called hyperlipoproteinemia type iii . newline_char most people with this disorder have two copies of the apoe e2 allele , leading researchers to conclude that the e2 allele plays a critical role in the development of the condition . newline_char a buildup of cholesterol and other fatty materials can lead to the formation of small , yellow skin growths called xanthomas and the development of atherosclerosis . newline_char apoe gene variants have also been studied as a potential risk factor for age-related macular degeneration , an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss among older people worldwide . newline_char some studies have suggested that having at least one copy of the apoe e4 allele may help protect against this disease or delay the onset of vision loss , while having at least one copy of the apoe e2 allele may increase the risk of this disease or cause symptoms to appear earlier . newline_char more research is needed to clarify what role , if any , apoe gene variants play in the development of age-related macular degeneration . story_separator_special_tag people with one — and especially two — e4 variants are significantly more likely to develop alzheimer 's than people without e4 . newline_char researchers also have found that adults with e2 variants have more plaques in their brains but are less likely to have symptoms of dementia .
