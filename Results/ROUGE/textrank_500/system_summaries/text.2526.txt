sa scientists have determined via an innovative satellite technique that a certain type of wildfire in the amazon rainforest is responsible for destroying several times more forest than that lost through deforestation in regards to recent years . newline_char " amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton of nasa 's goddard space flight center and the study 's lead author said in a press release . newline_char the study , published in philosophical transactions of the royal society b , demonstrates that , in years with the most understory fire activity , such as 2005 , 2007 and 2010 , the area of forest affected was several times greater than the area affected by deforestation for expansion of agriculture . newline_char fires in the amazon 's savanna areas can burn quickly , spreading up to 330 feet per minute , according to the  story_separator_special_tag a new satellite imaging technique has allowed scientists to see amazonian fires burning beneath the jungle canopy , called " understory fires , " which were previously difficult to detect . newline_char these fires destroy several times more forest than is taken out by deforestation each year , according to a new study , published recently in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b . newline_char " amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton , a researcher at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , md.
