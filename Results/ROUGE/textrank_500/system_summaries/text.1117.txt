wever , sleep appears to have another important function : helping us learn . newline_char sleep appears to be important for long-term potentiation , a strengthening of signals between neurons that is widely regarded as a mechanism of learning and memory . newline_char certain memories acquired during the day appear to be reactivated and “ replayed ” in the brain during sleep , which may help make them longer lasting . newline_char in some instances the amount of improvement that occurs on memory tasks positively correlates with the length of time spent in certain stages of sleep . newline_char these and other findings are generating great excitement among sleep researchers , as well as prompting heated debates about the degree to which sleep may or may not be involved in learning . newline_char to date , most sleep and learning research has focused on recall , which is the capacity to remember information . newline_char however , new research by stéphanie mazza and colleagues at the university of lyon , recently published in the journal psychological science , suggests another potential benefit of sleep : improved relearning . story_separator_special_tag abstract both repeated practice and sleep improve long-term retention of information . newline_char in the study reported here , we investigated whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation could help to save practice time during relearning . newline_char half of them learned in the morning and relearned in the evening of a single day . newline_char the other half learned in the evening of one day , slept , and then relearned in the morning of the next day . newline_char we found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention . newline_char sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy , but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy .
