e day has finally come for kfc 's gluttonous double down sandwich to premier , and we were among the first in line to test it this morning ( yes , we were eating this sandwich at 10:45 a.m. newline_char the double down ( also available with grilled chicken ) consists of two boneless original recipe filets , two strips of bacon , two slices of monterey jack and pepperjack cheese and a special colonel 's sauce.the complete review after the jump.grade : bnutritional info : 540 calories , 32 grams fat,1380 mgs sodiumthis sandwich is n't for the faint of heart . newline_char the bacon was legit -- it did n't have the usual weirdly chewy , artificial bacon-bit taste -- but it was essentially lost , both physically and flavor-wise ( along with the cheese ) , between the two behemoth chicken filets . newline_char and there was a lot of discussion around whether the cheese was really a cheese spread , or if it had just melded with the special sauce.with a complete bite of chicken , cheese , bacon and sauce , this sandwich really is n't bad . newline_char while we probably would n't order another (  story_separator_special_tag â€‹the much-touted kfc double down chicken sandwich finally arrives . newline_char cradled in your hand , it seems a rather paltry thing ; indeed , the entire sandwich in its tiny paper chemise can barely fill the small cardboard hamburger box it comes in . newline_char the chicken itself is stringy and none-too-tender , the taste of the cheese pointedly interferes with the mild chicken flavor , and the bacon is indiscernible if you bite down on the whole thing at once . newline_char it 's probably not the worst $ 5 meal in town .
