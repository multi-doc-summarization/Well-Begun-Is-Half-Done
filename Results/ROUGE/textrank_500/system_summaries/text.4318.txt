ientists at the university of bern said thursday they have determined what the comet would smell like by analyzing the chemicals in its coma , the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus . newline_char for this , they used one of the instruments aboard the european spacecraft rosetta that is preparing to drop a lander onto the comet 's icy surface nov. newline_char project leader kathrin altwegg of the university of bern said the aroma will get stronger as 67p gets closer to the sun , causing it to release more gas and form the coma characteristic of comets . story_separator_special_tag with inputs from kathrin altwegg , rosina science team , university of bern . newline_char since early august , the rosetta orbiter sensor for ion and neutral analysis ( rosina ) has been ‘ sniffing the fumes ’ of 67p/c-g with its two mass spectrometers . newline_char as reported previously in this blog , even though the comet is still more than 400 million kilometres from the sun , the mixture of molecules detected in the comet ’ s coma is surprisingly rich already . newline_char before arriving at 67p/c-g , the rosina team thought that at these vast distances from the sun , its relatively low intensity would only release the most volatile molecules via sublimation , namely carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide . story_separator_special_tag an instrument aboard the probe rosetta has detected some intriguing chemical signatures from comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko since their rendezvous in deep space in august , they said . story_separator_special_tag [ image-36 ] the european space agency ’ s rosetta mission will deploy its lander , philae , to the surface of comet 67p/churyumov–gerasimenko on nov. newline_char rosetta is an international mission spearheaded by the european space agency with support and instruments provided by nasa . newline_char in that time , the rosetta mission has been conducting an unprecedented scientific analysis of the comet
