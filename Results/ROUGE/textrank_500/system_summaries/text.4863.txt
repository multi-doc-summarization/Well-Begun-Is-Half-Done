 wednesday , researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered , the remains of bacteria thriving on earth not long , geologically speaking , after the very birth of the planet . newline_char van kranendonk , a geologist at the university of new south wales , called the patterns in the rocks “ dubiofossils ” — fossil-like structures , perhaps , but without clear proof that they started out as something alive . newline_char heated disputes are nothing new in the search for the earliest life on earth . newline_char william schopf , a paleontologist at the university of california , los angeles , and his colleagues found what that they , too , argued were the world ’ s oldest fossils : chainlike blobs in 3.46 billion-year-old rocks made , they said , by bacteria . story_separator_special_tag as amazing and fascinating as a few billion years ’ worth of fossils are , we still ultimately want that holy grail that illuminates the origins of life on earth . newline_char each new find that purports to supplant the earliest known signs of life is virtually guaranteed to be controversial , subject to poking and prodding from skeptical scientists uncertain that every competing ( non-living ) explanation can be ruled out . newline_char last august , for example , a paper claimed to show the remnants of stromatolites ( small mounds built by communities of shallow water microorganisms ) in 3.7 billion-year-old rocks in greenland . newline_char similar fossils from australia that come in at about 3.5 billion years old are generally accepted as legit , but anything older is still subject to scientific debate . newline_char now , a new study led by university college london phd student matthew dodd describes evidence of what the researchers believe to be seafloor bacteria that lived at least 3.7 billion years ago .
