is morning i woke up with a hangover softly pulsing in my left temple . newline_char i took a quick inventory : last night i went from happy-hour drinks with a former colleague ( two glasses of rosé— or was it three ? newline_char ) , then to dinner with a friend ( another glass of rosé ) , then to a nightcap with another friend ( a beer ) . newline_char i don ’ t make a habit of bar-crawling on weekday nights the way i did when i was in my 20s and working in d.c. now i live in los angeles , where i ’ m a freelancer whose meetings mostly take place over coffee and whose friends are more likely to suggest we go for a hike than a cocktail . newline_char and so when i do end up having more than a single glass of wine with dinner , i don ’ t beat myself up about it . newline_char but this morning was different . newline_char “ i see that booze is the oil in our motors , the thing that keeps us purring when we  story_separator_special_tag i ’ m newly sober and dog-paddling through the booze all around me . newline_char ) at the office , every desk near mine has a bottle of wine or liquor on it in case people are too lazy to walk the 50 feet to one of the well-stocked communal bars we ’ ve built on our floor . newline_char traveling for work , i steel myself for the company-sponsored wine tasting . newline_char my plan is to work the room with my soda and lime , make sure i ’ m seen by the five people who care about these things , and leave before things get sloppy ( which they always do ) . newline_char six wines and four beers are on display at the catering stand .
