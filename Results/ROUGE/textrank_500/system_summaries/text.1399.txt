age copyright getty images image caption as the oil and gas industry has expanded in parts of the us , so have the number of earthquakes massive injections of wastewater from the oil and gas industry are likely to have triggered a sharp rise in earthquakes in the state of oklahoma . newline_char researchers say there has been a forty-fold increase in the rate of quakes in the us state between 2008-13 . newline_char the scientists found that the disposal of water in four high-volume wells could be responsible for a swarm of tremors up to 35km away . newline_char sudden swarm there has been increasing evidence of links between the process of oil and gas extraction and earthquakes in states like arkansas , texas , ohio and oklahoma in recent years . newline_char this new research goes further , linking a large swarm of oklahoma tremors  story_separator_special_tag more than 230 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 3.0 have shaken the state of oklahoma already this year . newline_char past research has shown that processes such as wastewater injection at oil drilling and fracking sites throughout the state could induce a small number of earthquakes but scientists have never been able to specifically link some of the more distant or stronger earthquakes with these sometimes faraway wastewater wells . newline_char a study published today in science explains how wastewater injection sites—areas where toxic water left over from oil drilling and fracking processes is injected into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting freshwater—could be driving the sharp increase in the sometimes-disastrous earthquake events . newline_char “ it really is unprecedented to have this many earthquakes over a broad region like this , ” says study co-author geoffrey abers of cornell university . newline_char ” abers and his colleagues dug up data on the rates and volumes of liquids associated with the wastewater injection
