 's like magic , but i live in los angeles where nobody uses their signals and that 's why this new tesla patent filing is especially exciting . newline_char tesla wants its vehicles to signal automatically without the driver needing to go through the agony that is lifting their finger and moving it up or down by several inches . newline_char the way that tesla envisions it working is that the car detects the driver 's intent to change lanes or make a turn by using the autopilot hardware at its disposal , it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them , it puts the signal on for the driver . newline_char if it works , it will be brilliant but given the fact that tesla has remained adamant that it does n't need driver monitoring systems for autopilot , it seems questionable that the vehicle would be able to detect a driver 's intent to turn based solely on external observation . newline_char there are plenty of systems out now from other manufacturers that will offer drivers a warning to use their signals after repeated turns or lane changes without them , but  story_separator_special_tag tesla has filed for a new patent that describes a technology to automate turn signals . newline_char surprisingly , it sounds like the technology is actually not for self-driving cars , but for drivers who forget/don ’ t use turn signals . newline_char by leveraging its autopilot technology , the automaker thinks it can detect when a driver should activate its turn signal and do it for them if they forget it . newline_char ” here ’ s a flowchart that explains when the system would activate the turn signal for the driver :
