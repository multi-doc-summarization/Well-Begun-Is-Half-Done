att writes for hakai magazine , modern sperm whales seem to have all descended from a single female . newline_char the researchers analyzed mitochondrial dna from 1,633 whales and found low genetic diversity . newline_char but that was no surprise : past research has demonstrated that many of what scientists call “ megafauna ” ( really big animals ) aren ’ t that genetically diverse . newline_char in 2002 , for example , researchers found that killer whales lack diversity in their genes despite their large population size—likely due to some past event that once dramatically reduced their population . story_separator_special_tag the sperm whale provides an interesting example of a long‐lived species with few geographic barriers to dispersal . newline_char worldwide mtdna diversity is relatively low , but highly structured among geographic regions and social groups , attributed to female philopatry . newline_char however , it is unclear whether this female philopatry is due to geographic regions or social groups , or how this might vary on a worldwide scale . newline_char to answer these questions , we combined mtdna information for 1091 previously published samples with 542 newly obtained dna profiles ( 394‐bp mtdna , sex , 13 microsatellites ) including the previously unsampled indian ocean , and social group information for 541 individuals . newline_char we found low mtdna diversity ( π = 0.430 % ) reflecting an expansion event < 80 000 years bp , but strong differentiation by ocean , among regions within some oceans , and among social groups . newline_char a hierarchical amova showed that regions were important for explaining mtdna variance in the indian ocean , but not pacific , with social group sampling in the atlantic too limited to include in analyses . newline_char social groups were important in partitioning mtdna and microsatellite variance within both oceans .
