en ottawa researchers publish a paper about a protein that can used to treat heart disease on tuesday , fellow scientists in california will probably be saying , “ doh ! newline_char the naturally-occurring protein , called cardiotrophin 1 , also known as ct-1 , can trick the heart into repairing damage and improving blood flow . newline_char therapy using the protein , which the ottawa researchers have already proved in animal models , will likely be ready for clinical trials in patients with right heart failure and myocardial infarction — heart attack — in two or three years . story_separator_special_tag a protein called cardiotrophin 1 might be an effective treatment for heart failure , according to researchers who found that it tricks the heart into growing in a healthy way . newline_char researchers from canada have shown that it may be possible to trick the heart into growing healthily , without having to exercise . newline_char researchers from canada have shown that it may be possible to trick the heart into growing healthily , without having to exercise . newline_char the study paper also describes how , in animal models of heart failure , cardiotrophin 1 ( ct1 ) promotes heart repair and improves blood flow . newline_char heart failure is a serious condition in which the heart can not pump enough oxygen-rich blood  story_separator_special_tag researchers have discovered that a protein called cardiotrophin 1 ( ct1 ) can trick the heart into growing in a healthy way and pumping more blood , just as it does in response to exercise and pregnancy . newline_char they also show that ct1 can repair heart damage and improve blood flow in animal models of heart failure . newline_char it occurs when the heart ca n't pump enough blood through the body , often because a heart attack has damaged the heart muscle tissue .
