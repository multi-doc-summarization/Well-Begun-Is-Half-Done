revisiae from native forests , vineyards , and the spontaneous ferments of vitis vinifera var sauvignon blanc fruit from six major regions in nz ( hawke ’ s bay , martinborough , nelson , wairau valley , awatere valley and central otago ) . newline_char bayesian population structure methods , and statistical analyses of the resulting ancestry profiles29 , showed significantly distinct sub-populations residing in each of these regions17 . newline_char here we use the genetic ancestry profiles produced from bayesian analysis , in combination with regional allele frequencies , to select s. newline_char cerevisiae genotypes from each of these regional sub-populations that span and represent the genetic diversity within each region . newline_char genotypes that belong to the main inferred population correlating with each region , that also maximize the diversity of alleles present in each region , were selected , including at least one  story_separator_special_tag the previously overlooked vintner , a type of yeast called saccharomyces cerevisiae , makes a “ small but significant ” contribution to a wine ’ s flavour and taste , scientists reported in the journal scientific reports . newline_char “ i was surprised that we detected any signal at all from these geographically different yeast populations in the aroma profile of the wine — i thought we would not , ”  story_separator_special_tag mat goddardthe distinct regional conditions , or terroir , in which grapes are grown are thought to shape a wine ’ s character . newline_char now , researchers in auckland , new zealand , have confirmed that at least one aspect of terroir—local differences in yeast strains—does indeed alter the outcome of sauvignon blanc fermentation . newline_char “ the take-home message of this paper is that different strains of yeast used to ferment grapes impart a specific chemistry to the wine , ” said microbiologist jack gilbert of the argonne national laboratory in illinois who was not involved in the work .
