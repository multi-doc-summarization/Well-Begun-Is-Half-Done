esident obama incessantly claims energy open-mindedness , insisting that his policy is “ all of the above. newline_char ” except , of course , for drilling : ●off the mid-atlantic coast ( as virginia , for example , wants ) ; ●off the florida gulf coast ( instead , the castro brothers will drill near there ) ; ●in the broader gulf of mexico ( where drilling in 2012 is expected to drop 30 percent below pre-moratorium forecasts ) ; ●in the arctic national wildlife refuge ( more than half the size of england , the drilling footprint being the size of dulles international airport ) ; ●on federal lands in the rockies ( where leases are down 70 percent since obama took office ) . story_separator_special_tag and with prices at the pump on the rise , so is the chant of “ drill , baby , drill. newline_char ” more and more , republicans are telling us that gasoline would be cheap and jobs plentiful if only we would stop protecting the environment and let energy companies do whatever they want . newline_char thus mitt romney claims that gasoline prices are high not because of saber-rattling over iran , but because president obama won ’ t allow unrestricted drilling in the gulf of mexico and the arctic national wildlife refuge . newline_char the irony here is that these claims come just as events are confirming what everyone who did the math already knew , namely , that u.s. energy policy has very little effect either on oil prices or on overall u.s. employment . newline_char for the truth is that we ’ re already having a hydrocarbon boom , with u.s. oil and gas production rising and u.s. fuel imports dropping .
