sed on his calculations , if adequate shelter is 15 minutes away , individuals should remain in their initial , poor-quality shelter no longer than 30 minutes after detonation . newline_char if , however , the better shelter is only five minutes away , individuals should move there immediately and forego the closer but unsafe buildings altogether , he wrote . newline_char reaching adequate shelter rapidly could save between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals from fatal exposure in the event of a single , low-yield detonation , said the study published in proceedings of the royal society a . story_separator_special_tag people living within about 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) of a small-scale nuclear attack have up to half an hour to seek out adequate shelter safely , as long as travel time to that shelter is no more than 15 minutes away , according to a recent report on the optimal escape strategies for small-scale nuclear explosions . newline_char still , the threat of smaller-scale nuclear attacks with explosive energy orders of magnitude less intense has increased in recent years as the technology to build such weapons has become more prevalent . newline_char these smaller-scale detonations may not be strong enough to flatten cities , but they do produce harmful radioactive fallout that residents must avoid to reduce the nauseating effects of radiation poisoning and longer-term risks of cancer . newline_char [ the top 10 largest explosions ever ] the best way to protect against the radioactive dust and ash of nuclear fallout is to seek shelter underground , but more than 20 percent of u.s. households do not have basements , according to a 2009 survey from the u.s. energy information administration . newline_char those people without basements must therefore decide when and how far to travel in search of higher-quality shelter in the event
