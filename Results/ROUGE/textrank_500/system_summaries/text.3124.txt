bglacial aquatic environments over the last several decades , by using ground penetrating radar and other remote sensing tools , scientists have discovered that under the massive antarctic ice sheets there lies a vast hydrological system of liquid water . newline_char this water exists because geothermal heat flow from below , coupled with pressure , movement , and the insulating nature of the ice sheet above , is great enough to maintain some areas at the base of the ice sheet above the freezing point , even in the extreme cold of antarctica . newline_char wissard in order to explore one of these hydrological systems at the margin of the west antarctic ice sheet , we have organized an interdisciplinary project to access the subglacial environment . newline_char the whillans ice stream subglacial access research drilling project ( wissard ) is using  story_separator_special_tag tomorrow 's edition of the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of microorganisms living far beneath antarctic ice . newline_char special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet , where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years . newline_char the discovery raises the obvious question of what other extreme environments might be able to harbor life on our planet , or beyond . newline_char similar expeditions have found sub-ice environments teeming with bacteria in recent years , but questions have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process . story_separator_special_tag these crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to .
