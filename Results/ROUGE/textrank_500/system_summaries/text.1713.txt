cnn ) -- if you follow scientific developments as if they were football games , this would be a good time to cheer " tick-tick-tick-tick ! newline_char you 'd never need this level of precision for getting to work on time , but the clock could be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems , said study co-author andrew ludlow , researcher at the national institute of standards and technology in boulder , colorado . newline_char the rate of ticking of this timepiece -- known informally ( and awkwardly ) as the ytterbium optical lattice clock -- does not change by more than one part in 10^18 , ludlow said . newline_char " the ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking , new level of clock stability , " he said . newline_char " one could say that this is like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds . story_separator_special_tag a pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has set a new record for stability . newline_char nist 's ultra-stable ytterbium lattice atomic clock . newline_char ytterbium atoms are generated in an oven ( large metal cylinder on the left ) and sent to a vacuum chamber in the center of the photo to be manipulated and probed by lasers . newline_char 22 issue of science express that the ytterbium clocks ' tick is more stable than any other atomic clock . newline_char the ytterbium clock ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion ( 1 followed by 18 zeros ) , roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks .
