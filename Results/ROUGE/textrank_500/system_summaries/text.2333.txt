e result of the venting may have been setting off an explosion , caused by either steam or hydrogen , that tore the outer wall and roof off the building housing reactor no . newline_char edano , it was clear form radioactive materials turning up in trace amounts outside the reactors that fuel damage had occurred . newline_char photo a meltdown occurs when there is insufficient cooling of the reactor core , and it is the most dangerous kind of a nuclear power accident because of the risk of radiation releases . story_separator_special_tag vienna radiation leaked from japan 's quake-stricken fukushima daiichi nuclear plant on saturday after a blast blew its roof off . newline_char the critical issue is what happens to the radioactive reactor fuel . newline_char " we do n't know enough about what the status of the fuel is in the reactor core , " nuclear expert mark hibbs of the carnegie endowment for international peace said . newline_char " the issue is whether the core is uncovered , whether the fuel is breaking up or being damaged , or whether the fuel is melting . newline_char an explosion occurred at the 40-year-old daichi 1 reactor as plant operator tokyo electric power co ( tepco ) tried to reduce pressure in the core after the total loss of power needed to keep water circulating to prevent it from overheating . newline_char the government later said radiation levels were low because the explosion had not affected the reactor core container , although it had severely damaged the main building . newline_char " the most probable ( cause of the blast ) is that the coolant , particularly if it 's water , can overheat and turn to steam more rapidly than it was designed to , " said nuclear fuel technology professor timothy abram at manchester university .
