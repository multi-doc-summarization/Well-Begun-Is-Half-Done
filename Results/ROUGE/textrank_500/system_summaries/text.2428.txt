o years ago , ellen martinsen , was collecting mosquitoes at the smithsonian 's national zoo , looking for malaria that might infect birds -- when she discovered something strange : a dna profile , from parasites in the mosquitoes , that she could n't identify . newline_char by chance , she had discovered a malaria parasite , plasmodium odocoilei -- that infects white-tailed deer . newline_char though white-tailed deer diseases have been heavily studied -- scientist had n't noticed that many have malaria parasites . newline_char martinsen and her colleagues estimate that the parasite infects up to twenty-five percent of white-tailed deer along the east coast of the united states . newline_char in hiding " you never know what you 're going to find when you 're out in nature -- and you look , " says martinsen , a research associate at the smithsonian 's conservation biology institute and adjunct faculty in the university of vermont 's biology department . newline_char " the new study , led by martinsen , was a collaboration with scientists at the smithsonian conservation biology institute , the american museum of natural history  story_separator_special_tag north america ’ s most popular game species , the white-tailed deer , harbors a secret : low levels of a malaria parasite that have only now been detected thanks to advanced dna technology . newline_char researchers led by ellen martinsen , a biologist at the smithsonian conservation biology institute ’ s genetics center in washington , d.c. newline_char using polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) technology , which amplifies dna to make it easier to study , they identified a genetic signature of an unexpected malaria parasite , plasmodium odocoilei , previously unknown in the americas . newline_char the researchers were able to obtain a large enough sample of blood from the mosquito ’ s enlarged abdomen to trace its origin to white-tailed deer .
