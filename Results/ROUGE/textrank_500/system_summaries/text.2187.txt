 the species with a sequenced genome closest to our most recent aquatic ancestor , the coelacanth provides a unique opportunity to identify genomic changes that were associated with the successful adaptation of vertebrates to the land environment . newline_char to understand this aspect of the water-to-land transition , we surveyed the latimeria genome annotations to identify genes that were present in the last common ancestor of all bony fish ( including the coelacanth ) but that are missing from tetrapod genomes . newline_char we were able to confirm that four genes that were shown previously to be absent in tetrapods ( and1 and and2 ( ref . story_separator_special_tag in the hope of reconstructing a pivotal step in evolution — the colonization of land by fish that learned to walk and breathe air — researchers have decoded the genome of the coelacanth , a prehistoric-looking fish whose form closely resembles those seen in the fossils of 400 million years ago . newline_char often called a living fossil , the coelacanth ( pronounced see-luh-canth ) was long believed to have fallen extinct 70 million years ago , until a specimen was recognized in a fish market in south africa in 1938 . newline_char the coelacanth has fleshy , lobed fins that look somewhat like limbs , as does the lungfish , an air-breathing freshwater fish . newline_char the coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods , meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants , from reptiles and birds to mammals . newline_char the decoding of the coelacanth genome , reported online wednesday in the journal nature , is a victory for the lungfish as the closer relative to the first tetrapod .
