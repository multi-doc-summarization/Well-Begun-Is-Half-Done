so there was a challenge for me : could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher ? newline_char chittka ’ s team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward , but they can also learn this trick from other bees , even though they have no experience with such a task in nature . newline_char the study “ successfully challenges the notion that 'big brains ' are necessary " for new skills to spread ,  story_separator_special_tag conversely , after 48 h of extensive training ( 20 instances of string pulling ) , 11 of the 15 foragers solved the task without feedback from the moving blue flower ( s5 video ) . newline_char latency to obtaining the reward ( 147 ± 23.44 s ) was much higher than for normal blue flower training ( 22.1 ± 1.5 s ; t test : t25 = 6.25 , p < 0.0001 ) . newline_char in fact , experienced bees may not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward . story_separator_special_tag scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward , and then those bees spread the learned technique to others . newline_char the groundbreaking study is the first to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills . newline_char thinking about insect brains in terms of size alone , however , is a trap . newline_char a study reported in the journal plos biology on tuesday , for instance , takes bee smarts in a surprising direction : scientists from the queen mary university of london suggest that the “ insects possess the essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission , ” as they
