ke other human pharmaceuticals , the antidepressant fluoxetine ( prozac ) enters the environment via sewage and has been detected at wastewater treatment plants . newline_char we conducted experiments to test whether chronic exposure to a maximally environmentally relevant concentration of fluoxetine ( 2.7 μg day−1 ) altered courtship behaviour and female reproductive physiology in wild-caught starlings ( sturnus vulgaris ) , a species commonly found foraging on invertebrates at wastewater treatment plants . newline_char when paired with a female over two days , males sang less and were more aggressive towards fluoxetine-treated females than controls . newline_char fluoxetine-treated females were initially aggressive towards males , becoming significantly less aggressive by the second day . newline_char we found no effect of female treatment on female courtship behaviour . newline_char our findings suggest that exposure to an antidepressant reduced female attractiveness , adding to growing evidence that environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals can alter important traits related to individual fitness and population dynamics . story_separator_special_tag but the amount of these drugs that end up in sewage plants may also have an impact on the mating habits of wild birds , a new study from the university of york shows . newline_char researchers found that female starlings that had been exposed to small doses of fluoxetine , the generic name for prozac , became less attractive to male starlings , which sung to them less often and treated them more aggressively . newline_char kathryn arnold , one of the study ’ s authors and a senior lecturer in ecology at the university of york , described it as “ the first evidence that low concentrations of an antidepressant can disrupt the courtship of songbirds. newline_char birds like to graze at sewage treatment plants , which are teeming with worms , flies and maggots , she explained .
