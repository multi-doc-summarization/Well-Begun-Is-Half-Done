tarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins ( afps ) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth . newline_char our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome afp-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice . newline_char abstract antifreeze proteins ( afps ) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that , by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of  story_separator_special_tag 23 ( upi ) -- fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over . newline_char for the benefit of avoiding frozen blood , antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins . newline_char that 's right , the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting . newline_char they discovered the antifreeze proteins ' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens . story_separator_special_tag scientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of antarctic fish survive in frigid waters . newline_char the notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the antarctic region . newline_char even after being studied for decades , the notothenioid , a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters , continues to hold surprises . newline_char notothenioids own the waters circling antarctica known as the southern ocean ; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees fahrenheit , it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region .
