study from the us national institutes of health presents some of the most precise human data yet on whether cutting carbs or fat has the most benefits for losing body fat . newline_char in a paper published august 13 in cell metabolism , the researchers show how , contrary to popular claims , restricting dietary fat can lead to greater body fat loss than carb restriction , even though a low-carb diet reduces insulin and increases fat burning . newline_char since 2003 , kevin hall , phd -- a physicist turned metabolism researcher at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases -- has been using data from dozens of controlled feeding studies conducted over decades of nutrition research to build mathematical models of how different nutrients affect human metabolism and body weight . newline_char his model simulations showed that only the carb-restricted diet would lead to changes in the amount of fat burned by the body , whereas the reduced-fat diet would lead to greater overall body fat loss , but he needed the human data to back it up . story_separator_special_tag nih study finds cutting dietary fat reduces body fat more than cutting carbs in a recent study , restricting dietary fat led to body fat loss at a rate 68 percent higher than cutting the same number of carbohydrate calories when adults with obesity ate strictly controlled diets . newline_char “ compared to the reduced-fat diet , the reduced-carb diet was particularly effective at lowering insulin secretion and increasing fat burning , resulting in significant body fat loss , ” said kevin hall , ph.d. newline_char “ but interestingly , study participants lost even more body fat during the fat-restricted diet , as it resulted in a greater imbalance between the fat eaten and fat burned .
