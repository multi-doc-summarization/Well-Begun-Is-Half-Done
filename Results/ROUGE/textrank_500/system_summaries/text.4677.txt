w , researchers have made a significant advance toward replacing large pieces of bone in humans by growing a pig ’ s own cells into bone in the lab and then using it to restore a piece of missing jaw . newline_char “ being able to translate into a large , functional animal model is an important step for this technology , ” says scott hollister , a biomedical engineer at the university of michigan , ann arbor , who was not involved in the study . newline_char but he says the new technique , now inching toward testing in humans , will still have to prove its advantages over other experimental bone regeneration approaches . newline_char but that procedure , called an autograft , creates a whole new bone injury that can be painful and  story_separator_special_tag note : we only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it , and that it is not junk mail . newline_char we do not capture any email address . story_separator_special_tag “ the pigs woke up , and a half-hour later they were eating , ” said gordana vunjak-novakovic , a professor of biomedical engineering at columbia university . newline_char vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues have managed to create living bone from stem cells . newline_char first , they made a ct scan to create a 3-d image of each pig ’ s jaw . newline_char they put the scaffold in a nutrient solution along with stem cells extracted from the pigs . newline_char the cells attached to the scaffold , forming a new bone identical to the original . newline_char then the researchers implanted the new bone in each pig . newline_char there was no problem with rejection , and the new bone integrated with the pig ’ s own tissue .
