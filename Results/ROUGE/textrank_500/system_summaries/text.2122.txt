flying snake flattens out into a weird flying-saucer shape in order to get some extra airtime , new research suggests . newline_char 29 ) in the journal of experimental biology , show that the southeast asian snake 's flattened , ufo-like cross-section gives it the right aerodynamic properties for gliding . newline_char while birds , and even humans using glider wings , are much better at their airborne maneuvers , the snake 's performance compares favorably to that of other gliding animals , such as flying squirrels , lizards and even ants , socha said . newline_char researchers already knew that the snakes curved around , splayed out their ribs to flatten their bodies and undulated as they were airborne — but they did n't know why . story_separator_special_tag choi snakes don ’ t need to be on a plane to fly : five species of the gliding reptiles can soar as far as 100 feet ( 30 meters ) in the tropical rain forests of southeast asia . newline_char now scientists have discovered the secret behind how these snakes stay airborne—they twist their bodies into an s shape that resembles an alien ’ s flying saucer from the side . newline_char scientists already knew that flying snakes climb up trees by using ridges on their belly scales to help grip bark as they slither upward , and that when the animals glide downward , they undulate from side to side . newline_char scientists don ’ t know how often or exactly why flying snakes fly , but it ’ s likely they use their aerobatics to escape predators , to move from tree to tree without having to descend to the forest floor , and possibly even to hunt prey .
