spite partial success , communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing , a state called complete locked-in state ( clis ) . newline_char four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) —two of them in permanent clis and two entering the clis without reliable means of communication—learned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions all requiring a “ yes ” or “ no ” thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fnirs . newline_char online fnirs classification of personal questions with known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine ( svm ) resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70 % . newline_char electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did not exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite occasional differences between the physiological signals representing a “ yes ” or “ no ” response . story_separator_special_tag using a device which detects patterns in brain activity , patients paralysed by als can answer ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ – and tell doctors they are ‘ happy ’ with life doctors have used a brain-reading device to hold simple conversations with “ locked-in ” patients in work that promises to transform the lives of people who are too disabled to communicate . newline_char the groundbreaking technology allows the paralysed patients – who have not been able to speak for years – to answer “ yes ” or “ no ” to questions by detecting telltale patterns in their brain activity . newline_char the condition was brought on by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or als , a progressive neurodegenerative disease which leaves people totally paralysed but still aware and able to think .
