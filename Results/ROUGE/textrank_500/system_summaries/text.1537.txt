anets with sizes between that of earth ( with radius ) and neptune ( about 4 ) are now known to be common around sun-like stars1,2,3 . newline_char most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique , by which the planet ’ s size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star . newline_char planets of size 2–4 have proved to have a wide range of densities , implying a diversity of compositions4,5 , but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as earth . newline_char here we report doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the earth-sized planet kepler-78b , which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours ( ref . story_separator_special_tag haywood & keith horne harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics , 60 garden street , cambridge , massachusetts 02138 , usa david w. newline_char buchhave , david charbonneau , courtney d. newline_char dressing , xavier dumusque , sara gettel , mercedes lopez-morales , david phillips , dimitar sasselov & andrew szentgyorgyi inaf - fundación galileo galilei , rambla josé ana fernandez pérez 7 , 38712 breña baja , spain emilio molinari , rosario cosentino , aldo f. story_separator_special_tag an artist 's illustration of the strange earth-like rocky planet kepler-78b , which orbits a sun-like star 400 light-years from earth . newline_char credit : david a. newline_char the exoplanet kepler-78b , whose supertight orbit baffles astronomers , is just 20 percent wider and about 80 percent more massive than earth , with a density nearly identical to that of our planet , two research teams report in separate papers published online today ( oct. newline_char " this is the planet that , in many respects , is the most like earth that 's been discovered outside our solar system , " said andrew howard
