sa announced monday that after 35 years of exploration , its voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new , unanticipated region of space near the edge of the solar system -- a " magnetic highway " where charged particles take the " exit ramp " to interstellar space . newline_char the region connects the sun 's magnetic field lines to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing " lower-energy charged particles that originate from inside our heliosphere ... story_separator_special_tag -- nasa 's voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new region at the far reaches of our solar system that scientists feel is the final area the spacecraft has to cross before reaching interstellar space . newline_char scientists refer to this new region as a magnetic highway for charged particles because our sun 's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines . newline_char this connection allows lower-energy charged particles that originate from inside our heliosphere -- or the bubble of charged particles the sun blows around itself -- to zoom out and allows higher-energy particles from outside to stream in . newline_char before entering this region , the charged particles bounced around in all directions , as if trapped on local roads inside the heliosphere . newline_char the voyager team infers this region is still inside our solar bubble because the direction of the magnetic field lines has not changed . story_separator_special_tag according to scientists working on the mission , voyager 1 has just entered a “ magnetic highway “ . newline_char ed stone , voyager project scientist , based at caltech , explained that this highway is connected to interstellar space , but is still inside the magnetic field of the sun . newline_char nasa scientists are calling it a highway because it lets particles in and out of the solar system .
