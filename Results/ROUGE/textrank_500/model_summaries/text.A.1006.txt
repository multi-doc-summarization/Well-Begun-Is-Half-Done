chicago will soon be home george lucas ' collection of art , film memorabilia , animation , and more—though the city was n't necessarily lucas ' first choice for his private museum . the filmmaker proposed a $ 700 million plan earlier this year to build the museum in san francisco , but his chosen bayside location was rejected , the new york times reports . the city 's presidio trust suggested he put the museum near his former film studio . instead , he opted for chicago , the chicago tribune reports . chicago mayor rahm emanuel had battled to win the museum for the city , where lucas lives part time ; his wife is from chicago . " i am humbled to be joining such an extraordinary museum community and to be creating the museum in a city that has a long tradition of embracing the arts and architecture , ” lucas says . “ choosing chicago is the right decision for the museum , but a difficult decision for me personally because of my strong personal and professional roots in the bay area . " the museum , set to open in 2018 , will display items as varied as norman rockwell paintings , a darth vader suit , movie posters , and special-effects technology , the tribune notes . the chicago sun-times calls it a $ 1 billion project , noting that it will be built on the city 's lakefront . ( it 's not the first time lucas has had to retool a massive building project . )
