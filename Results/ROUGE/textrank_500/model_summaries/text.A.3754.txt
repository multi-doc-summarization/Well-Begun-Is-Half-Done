there 's a surprising new skeptic on the eligibility of the canadian-born ted cruz to be president : john mccain . " it came up in my race because i was born in panama , but i was born in the canal zone , which is a territory , " mccain said wednesday on 550 kfyi . " barry goldwater was born in arizona when it was a territory when he ran in 1964. ” mccain and goldwater were two of the examples cruz used to justify his eligibility when he addressed the issue this week . cruz was born in canada , but his mother was a us citizen , which gave him us citizenship at birth , buzzfeed reports . " it was a us military base , ” mccain clarified to kfyi about his own birth . “ that ’ s different from being born on foreign soil , so i think there is a question . i am not a constitutional scholar on that , but i think it ’ s worth looking into . " according to chris cillizza at the washington post , it 's really not all that surprising mccain would join donald trump and rand paul in questioning the eligibility of cruz , who cillizza describes as mccain 's " longtime nemesis . " in the past , mccain has accused cruz of " grandstanding " and lumped him in with tea party " wacko birds . " cillizza characterizes mccain 's statements on cruz 's eligibility as an act of revenge . " by mccain giving a 'you know , that 's a good question ' response to the question of whether cruz is eligible to be president , he keeps the story—not a good one for the texas senator—very much alive , " cillizza writes .
