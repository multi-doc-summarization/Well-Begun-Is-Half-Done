syria 's civil war raged on today , without the slightest pause of acknowledgement for yesterday 's rare bashar al-assad speech . it was billed as the unveiling of a " peace plan , " but assad offered essentially no concessions and spent much of the speech justifying his bloody crackdown . and there may be repercussions : in it , he dismissed the work of un envoy lakhdar brahimi , saying , " everyone who comes to syria knows that syria accepts advice , but not orders , " and the new york times predicts such remarks might cause brahimi to wash his hands of the conflict . that would present the us and other " friends of syria " with a quandary : get more involved , or potentially watch the conflict continue indefinitely . and though celebratory gunfire rang out afterward , even some loyalists were unimpressed . " it sounded more like gloating than making promises , " one assad supporter tells reuters . " everything he suggests now , it is too late . the rebels are n't going to stop . " indeed , hours after the speech , fresh clashes broke out along the road to damascus ' international airport , and regime artillery reportedly hit a district just three miles from where assad spoke . one assad critic in a hard-hit district agreed that the speech meant little . " here , no one cares about this speech . they care about food and electricity . "
