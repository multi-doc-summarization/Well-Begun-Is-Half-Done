starting next summer , licensed gun owners will be able to carry concealed weapons into buildings at public universities in texas ; in 2017 , the same will be true at community colleges . and at least one professor is not happy about the prospect of guns in his classroom : he 's resigning over the " campus carry " gun law passed earlier this year , inside higher ed reports . " as much as i have loved the experience of teaching and introducing these students to economics at the university , i have decided not to continue , " daniel s. hamermesh wrote in a letter to university of texas at austin administrators this week . " with a huge group of students my perception is that the risk that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom and start shooting at me has been substantially enhanced by the concealed-carry law . " hamermesh is a sue killam professor emeritus of economics at the university , and he continues in the letter that he " can not believe that i am the only potential or current faculty member who is aware of and disturbed by this heightened risk . " but , as inside higher ed notes , supporters of the new law say it will make campuses safer , because those carrying guns could defend against an active shooter . seven other states have similar " campus carry " laws , including oregon , where a shooter recently killed nine people at a community college . since that shooting , other texas faculty members have voiced their opposition to the state 's new gun law , including a ut el paso lecturer who 's been protesting the law ( including with a " no guns " sign outside his classroom ) and another ut austin professor who gave an interview warning that the law could " shut down free speech " in classrooms . yet another wrote a time op-ed on the subject this week ; that professor is a member of ut gun free , an organization that is circulating an anti-campus carry petition and has held several anti-campus carry forums .
