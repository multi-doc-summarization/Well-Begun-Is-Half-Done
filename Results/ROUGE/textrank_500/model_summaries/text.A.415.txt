a subantarctic archipelago is making " huge news " : the new zealand herald reports there are officially no more mice on the country 's antipodes islands , which once housed up to 200,000 of the rodents . they caused a big threat to the world heritage site by preying on native birds , bugs , and plants , and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public , with the " million mouse project " fundraising campaign bringing six figures . the department of conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016 . a team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none . " this is huge news for conservation both in new zealand and internationally , " says new zealand conservation minister eugenie sage . she says more than two dozen types of birds , 21 uncommon plants , and more than 150 insect species will benefit . both radio new zealand and npr note the mice originally found their way to the antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species , as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands . the initiative in the antipodes is n't a stand-alone : the island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity , including goats , rats , cats , rabbits , and a local meat-eating weasel . new zealand 's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050 , per nature .
