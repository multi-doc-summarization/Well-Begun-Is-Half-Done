" your skills play into the hands of people who are out to remove me and wikileaks from the world ... surely you can see why it is a bad idea for me to meet with you . " " i believe you are well intentioned , " he continues , noting he would enjoy meeting the british actor and is fond of his work , but " you will be used , as a hired gun , to assume the appearance of the truth in order to assassinate it . by meeting with you , i would validate this wretched film , and endorse the talented , but debauched , performance that the script will force you to give . " ultimately , he encourages cumberbatch to reconsider his role in the movie ; afterward , the actor did consider dropping out , raw story reports . the movie is due out next week . click for the full letter .
