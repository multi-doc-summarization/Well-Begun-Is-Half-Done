you wo n't see any sex or violence in the new r-rated film love is strange . what you will see is a love story between two men—which has critics wondering whether homophobia might explain the mpaa 's rating decision . the movie is about a couple who must live apart after decades together . yet critics have observed that it 's received the same rating as the new sin city movie , which contains violence , drugs , and nudity , and jersey shore massacre , which is packed with gore , the guardian notes . " it is very hard to imagine that if it starred , say , robert duvall and jane fonda as a similar long-time couple suddenly facing homelessness , it would be lumped in with movies crammed full of queasily stylish sexism and sickening torture porn , " writes stephen whitty in the star-ledger . the mpaa tells the wrap : " the descriptor that accompanies the film 's rating notes that it is rated r for language—as is any film that includes the same level of strong language , regardless of subject matter . " but the mpaa has been known to show " considerable leeway on language " in other instances , whitty notes .
