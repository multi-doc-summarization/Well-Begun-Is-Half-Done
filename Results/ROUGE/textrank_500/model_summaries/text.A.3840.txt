the 115th congress was sworn in tuesday , and kansas rep. roger marshall was one of the newbies who took advantage of a photo op with speaker paul ryan after the ceremony . but per cnn , another marshall ended up stealing the spotlight : the congressman 's son , who started dabbingâ€”for the uninitiated , wikipedia describes it as " a dance move in which the dancer simultaneously drops the head while raising an arm and the elbow in a gesture that has been noted to resemble sneezing , " and often employed by the carolina panthers ' cam newton to celebrate a touchdown . ryan seemed flummoxed by whatever was going on next to him , asking young marshall , " do you want to put your hand down ? " ryan said , gently pulling the boy 's arm down . " you gon na sneeze ? that it ? " the elder marshall responded with details of his son 's fate tuesday afternoon , tweeting , " just so you know @ speakerryan : he 's grounded . " but ryan 's take on the dab debacle showed it was less the punishment he was concerned about and more answers that he sought . " just finished swearing-in photos . nearly 300 members . countless cute kids . still do n't get what dabbing is , though , " he tweeted tuesday evening . someone tape a panthers game for him ?
