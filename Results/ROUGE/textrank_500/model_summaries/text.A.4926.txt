a billboard near a " gentlemen 's club " in birmingham screams out " strip for me " to passersby , which is notable mainly because it was put up not by the club but by a local church , reports wbrc . the pastor of rock church is paraphrasing a line from the bible 's book of hebrews i , in which people are asked to strip away their sins and encumbrances to serve jesus . the pastor says his attention-grabbing stunt has a simple purpose : he wants guys to think twice about going into the club and spend that time with their families instead .
