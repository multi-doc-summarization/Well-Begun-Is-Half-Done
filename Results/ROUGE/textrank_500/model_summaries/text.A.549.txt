listen in on any language anywhere in the world and you 're bound to hear a familiar sound : " huh ? " dutch researchers who studied 10 languages on five continents say the one-syllable utterance might be that rarest of things : a universal word . and it 's no mere tic or meaningless grunt , they say in their plos one study : it serves the vital purpose of allowing one person to let another know quickly that he does n't understand something . it 's " the glue that holds a broken conversation together , " explains the los angeles times . " you ca n't have a conversation without the ability to make repairs , " says a stanford expert not involved with the study but intrigued by it . " it is a universal need , no matter what kind of conversation you have . " the researchers found the word in widely different languages ranging from icelandic to mandarin chinese to west african siwu , reports the new york times . and though it may sound a bit different in some tongues—more like " ah " or " eh " —it remains fundamentally the same . they chalk it up to " convergent evolution , " notes science codex , a term from biology . it 's used to explain how different species , such as dolphins and sharks , evolve in similar ways because they live in similar environments . it seems that " huh ? " is the linguistic version , a tool so useful to humans everywhere that they ca n't live without it . ( in other language news , researchers suggest that being bilingual helps ward off dementia . )
