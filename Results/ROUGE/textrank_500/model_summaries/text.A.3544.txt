what at first appeared to be a tragic accident is now labeled a " coldhearted scheme . " two children , ages 8 and 13 , died on april 9 , 2015 , when the car their father was driving sped off a los angeles wharf and sank . ali elmezayen , whose window was open , quickly emerged , followed by his domestic partner , rabab diab , but their severely autistic children , strapped in the back seat of the 1998 honda civic , were pronounced dead once divers freed them . prosecutors now say it was a double murder planned by elmezayen , 44 , for more than two years , per the washington post . in 2012 and 2013 , elmezayen allegedly purchased several accidental death policies providing more than $ 6 million in coverage for his family , costing him 20 % of his annual salary , which was less than $ 30,000 , per a doj release . prosecutors say he even confirmed that claims would n't be investigated after two years . the crash allegedly came two years and 12 days after the last policy was bought , per the ap . " the alleged conduct shocks the conscience , " says us attorney nick hanna . the problem is that the evidence may not prove murder . elmezayen , who initially speculated about an " evil inside of me that pushed me to go , " later said the car 's brakes failed , and saltwater corrosion has made it difficult to determine their condition at the time of the crash , per the ap . citing insufficient evidence of murder , the los angeles county district attorney 's office has instead charged elmezayen with mail fraud , wire fraud , and aggravated identity theft , alleging he posed as diab in interactions with insurance companies . held without bail , elmezayen faces up to 20 years in prison for each fraud count if convicted . ( cops say a mom 's " moment of frustration " led to her toddler 's death . )
