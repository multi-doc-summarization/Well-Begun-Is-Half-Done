soon , you could see mta buses in new york with the words " killing jews is worship that draws us close to allah " on the side . that 's because a controversial pro-israel group wants to run the ads—they show a man with a palestinian keffiyeh covering his face alongside the aforementioned quote , which is attributed to " hamas mtv , " plus the slogan , " that 's his jihad . what 's yours ? " —and this week a federal judge decreed that the mta must comply in order to abide by the first amendment , courthouse news reports . ( there is no " hamas mtv " ; the ad is actually referencing a music video militants broadcast in the gaza strip . ) the decision wo n't take effect for a month , in case the agency wants to appeal , the new york times reports . the pro-israel organization in question is pamela geller 's american freedom defense initiative , which has previously brought us anti-islam ads in new york and chicago , ads comparing jihadists to " savages , " and ads showing a plane about to hit the world trade center . ( the southern poverty law center labels the afdi a hate group , raw story notes . ) the group sued the mta after the " killing jews " ads were initially rejected . though the mta says it fears the ads could be seen as calling for harm to jews , the judge noted that similar ads in chicago and san francisco in 2013 did not result in violence . the ad is a parody of the council on american-islamic relations ' " my jihad " campaign , which seeks to frame jihad as a " personal struggle against sins or temptations " rather than holy war , the washington times notes .
