angry streaming customers in chicago are fighting back against the so-called " netflix tax , " filing a lawsuit against the city last wednesday that could have national implications , the daily dot reports . the plaintiffs—including netflix , hulu , and spotify customers—allege the 9 % tax on streaming services ( an extension of chicago 's amusement tax ) announced in june violates the internet tax freedom act , which outlaws discrimination against internet businesses . according to fortune , the lawsuit claims streaming customers now face a higher tax rate than if they were watching a dvd , going to the theater , or attending a concert . if the suit succeeds , it could hamper local governments ' ability to tax internet services at a time when increased online commerce is shrinking tax revenues around the country . the lawsuit also alleges the streaming tax is essentially a new one , not an extension of the amusement tax as chicago 's city comptroller claimed . new taxes , unlike changes to existing taxes , require a vote of city officials . " if the city wants to tax internet-based streaming media services , then it should put the measure through the political process and let chicagoans have their voices heard through the democratic process , " an attorney for the plaintiffs says in a press release . the chicago tribune reports the city has vowed to fight the lawsuit . the " netflix tax , " part of mayor rahm emanuel 's plan to make up the city 's budget gap through new fees , is set to go into effect in january .
