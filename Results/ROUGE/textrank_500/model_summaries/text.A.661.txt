as the uk has alleged , ruslan boshirov is not who he says he is , at least according to an online investigative group . the guardian reports bellingcat and investigative partner the insider say they have identified one of the men accused of poisoning the skripals with novichok as a colonel with russia 's military intelligence service , the gru . that man is col. anatoliy chepiga , who fought in the war in chechnya and in 2014 received the state 's highest award : hero of the russian federation . the bbc notes the award is generally given by vladimir putin , who has previously stated that boshirov and companion alexander petrov are merely civilians ; the men have said they traveled to salisbury as tourists to see a well known cathedral there . bellingcat suspects the mission that spurred that honor was a secret one ; while most recipients ' heroics are described in detail , chepiga simply received his award " by decree from the russian president . " as for how the alleged identification came to be , bellingcat explains a source suggested it look at whether the men could have attended the far eastern military command academy , which had " the best reputation for foreign-language training and overseas clandestine operations . " it came upon a photo that it thought could be boshirov and continued its web searching , which ultimately led it to chepiga 's name and passport file . a 2003 photo in the file " strongly resembled a younger 'boshirov . ' " the bbc had this to say : " british officials have not commented . the bbc understands there is no dispute over the identification . "
