the world 's least shocking quote : a british man 's admission that his fairly miraculous swim across the hoover dam reservoir was " drink fueled , " per the guardian . arron hughes speaks to the daily post about his aug. 10 experience , which came after what he says was a 37-hour bachelor-party bender with friends in las vegas . he describes it as a brutally hot day and says that as they stood under the 726-foot-tall structure , he decided , " f -- - it ! i 'm going for a swim . " what he did n't know then that he knows now : some 275 people have died at the dam over the last decade , and no one has successfully made it across the full width of the colorado river there . but he apparently had luck on his side : only one of the 10 hydroelectric turbines were powered on during his swim . " i swam from arizona to nevada , " he tells the post . " i went across first and then swam back . ... it took about 30 minutes to do . even though i was knackered half way across i knew i had to get to the other side . " he reportedly told the sun that he was about 160 feet from the dam and felt a strong tug . " i was sucked towards the wall and had to swim hard . " he says police were waiting for him and handcuffed him for what he did n't realize was n't permitted , as he says there are n't any " no swimming " signs posted . " you 're just expected not to . " he says he ended up getting fined about $ 330 , but , as the tattoo on his body reads , per the times of london : " no regrets . " ( this bachelor party ended up being a scam . )
