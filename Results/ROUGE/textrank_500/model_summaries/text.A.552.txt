the chemical spill that has left more than 300,000 people in west virginia without water appears to be the product of lax regulation in a state where coal and chemical firms have long operated with little oversight , the new york times finds . a document released over the weekend reveals state authorities were aware that the company responsible was storing up to a million pounds of the coal-cleaning chemical crude mchm at a riverside facility near a water treatment plant , but it 's not clear whether the treatment plant knew about the risk , reports the wall street journal . " we can â€™ t just point a single finger at this company , " says the director of the west virginia rivers coalition , noting that the site of the spill had n't been inspected since 1991 . " we need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests . " a tap water ban is still in place in the charleston region , where many schools and businesses remain closed , but authorities say they can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " and they expect the ban to be lifted within days , starting in downtown charleston and other priority zones , nbc reports .
