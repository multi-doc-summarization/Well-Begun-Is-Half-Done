just as exciting as a maury paternity test , but slightly more stomach-churning : the dna test results are in for a kfc meal a california man claimed was a deep-fried rat . and those results show that it 's definitely , absolutely , without a doubt nothing other than a fried chicken tender , just as the restaurant chain has insisted from day one , abc news reports . the company had commissioned a lab test after 25-year-old devorise dixon posted a photo earlier this month to his facebook page that showed a breaded , fried piece of … something that looked disgustingly like a rat had fallen into the batter vat . the photo soon went viral , and dixon claimed on facebook that when he went back to the restaurant , a manager admitted it was a rat and apologized . kfc decided to call dixon 's bluff . " recently , a customer questioned the quality of a kfc product , and this received considerable publicity given the sensational nature of his claim , " the company said in a statement given to abc . on june 19 , " the customer 's attorney turned over the product in question for testing at an independent lab , and the results officially confirmed what kfc knew all along—the product was chicken and not a rat as he claimed . " abc could n't reach dixon for comment , but kfc has the obviously simple explanation for the oddly-shaped repast : " our chicken tenders often vary in size and shape . " the company also wants dixon to say he 's sorry and " cease making false claims , " per fox news . ( we had a feeling fried rat was n't part of kfc 's $ 185 million plan to win customers back . )
