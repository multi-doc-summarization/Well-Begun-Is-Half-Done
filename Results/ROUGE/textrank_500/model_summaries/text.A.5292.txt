" while the interview made headlines mostly for this line on sunday , just a day before trump is slated to meet face-to-face with putin , trump also said he believes the same about russia and others . " russia is foe in certain respects . china is a foe economically , certainly they are a foe . but that does n't mean they are bad . it does n't mean anything . it means that they are competitive , " trump said . trump also sat with former cnn news show host piers morgan for the daily mail . as usa today notes , the interview touched on some of today 's most hot-button issues , including the us supreme court 's potential to revisit roe vs. wade , trump 's meeting with queen elizabeth ii , and child separation at the southern border . the interview took place aboard air force one , where trump told morgan he believes there 's a " very good chance " the high court wo n't address the landmark 1973 decision to legalize abortion . trump also told morgan he " had a great feeling " during his meeting with the queen and discussed with her the complexities of the brexit issue . he added that putin was " probably " ruthless , " but i could name others also .
