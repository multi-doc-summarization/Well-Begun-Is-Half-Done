lena dunham caused a stir last week when she and girls co-creator jenni konner issued a statement defending a girls writer from allegations of sexual assault against a teen . she has since apologized , but that did n't appease one of the writers for her lenny e-newsletter . per vulture , zinzi clemmons issued a statement sunday announcing she 'll no longer work for lenny and that it 's because of dunham 's " well-known racism , " which she also dubs " hipster racism . " meaning , in clemmons ' words , that the offender " typically uses sarcasm as a cover , and in the end it looks a lot like gaslighting—'it 's just a joke . why are you overreacting ? ' " clemmons explains she feels comfortable saying this about dunham , as she 's known her since they were both in college , when dunham and her rich friends " had a lot of power and seemed to get off on simultaneously wielding it and denying it . " clemmons adds that someone close to her was " victimized " back then by " someone in lena 's circle " and that he " continues to move in those circles and has a powerful job . " she says she stayed at lenny only because she had a good relationship with the editors there , but that now " it is time for women of color—black women in particular—to divest from lena dunham . " jezebel points out a string of other tweets clemmons posted on the subject , including calling dunham 's online apology a " half-assed attempt to cover your ass . " clemmons also does n't seem fazed by her detractors . " to all the haters , harassers and abusers creeping into my timeline , remember this : i brought down a major celebrity and her publication with one facebook post . try me , " she tweeted early monday .
