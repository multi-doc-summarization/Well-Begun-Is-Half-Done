jeff sessions ' two-day confirmation hearing came to a close wednesday with something that 's never happened before : a current senator testifying against another current senator up for a cabinet position . cnn reports sen. cory booker , despite having worked well with the attorney general nominee in the past , said his " conscience " forced him to take the unprecedented step . " the arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice , we must bend it , " booker testified . " america needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc . " the senator from new jersey said sessions has shown a lack of " commitment " —and has in fact shown " hostility " —toward supporting equal rights for all americans , according to abc news . during his five-minute testimony , booker said he was worried sessions would n't work to reduce mass incarceration , ensure equal rights for lgbt citizens , or protect the voting rights of immigrants . mediaite reports he said he was also concerned sessions would n't address racial bias in policing . booker , who admitted his choice to testify was n't a popular one among fellow senators , was joined by rep. john lewis and rep. cedric richmond . meanwhile , mediaite states many are seeing booker 's first-of-its-kind testimony as a bid for attention ahead of a run for president in 2020 . supporters continued to deny all accusations of racism against sessions , who 's likely to be confirmed .
