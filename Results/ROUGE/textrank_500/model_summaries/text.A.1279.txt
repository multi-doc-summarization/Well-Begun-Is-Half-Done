pepsi has given up trying to defend what some people are calling the worst ad of all time . the company has pulled its widely ridiculed ad featuring kendall jenner as a model who joins a protest and hands a can of pepsi to a riot cop , the ap reports . " pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity , peace , and understanding , " the company said in a statement . " clearly we missed the mark , and we apologize . " pepsi also apologized to jenner for putting her " in this position . " the ad , which showed protesters with signs like " join the conversation , " was strongly criticized for hijacking the imagery of real protest movements like black lives matter to sell soft drinks . bernice king , daughter of martin luther king jr. , delivered one of the most powerful criticisms , tweeting a photo of her father being pushed back by police at a protest march and quipping : " if only daddy would have known about the power of # pepsi . " stephen colbert was among the late-night hosts poking fun at the ad on wednesday , the independent reports . " we have a deeply divided nation , " said the late show host . " but today , it seems that everyone has come together to join the protest against the new protest ad from pepsi . " he described the " join the conversation " banner as " the most corporate message ever . "
