the disappearance of another jet in southeast asia while the fate of malaysia airlines flight 370 remains a mystery comes as a shock to the aviation world , but experts stress that the two cases are very different . the new york times runs through some of the differences with airasia flight 8501 : unlike with flight 370 , there has been no sign that anybody on flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems , meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search . flight 370 disappeared on a clear night , while flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather , with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route . the airasia pilot 's last communication with air traffic control was a request " to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet . " flight 370 's pilot was very experienced , with more than 18,000 hours of flying time , while the combined experience of flight 8501 's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that . neither flight 370 nor flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call , but , as the ap notes , " pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free , " and there 's no sign that the airasia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the malaysia airlines flight did . another major difference is the search area for flight 8501 , which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for flight 370 . " we are not talking about the deep indian ocean here , " says cnn aviation correspondent richard quest . " we are talking about congested airspace around southeast asia . there will be much better radar coverage . there 's certainly better air traffic control coverage . "
