" we have never faced this before : purposeful , vindictive chaos , " jon stewart said tuesday , summing up president trump 's first 10 days in office during an appearance on the late show with stephen colbert . impersonating trump with a " dead animal on head " and a tie reaching the floor , the former daily show host read out trump 's next executive orders . the first : " china shall immediately and without hesitation send us their wall . " the second : the official language of the united states is now " bulls -- t. " the third : " i , donald j. trump , am exhausting " because " every instinct and fiber of my pathological self-regard calls me to abuse of power . " the segment had stewart , colbert , and the audience in stitches—particularly when the aforementioned dead animal appeared to try to crawl down stewart 's face—but stewart chose to end it on a serious note , per the new york daily news . he called on america 's " relentless stamina and vigilance and every institutional check and balance this country can muster " to restrain trump , per variety , noting , " if we do not allow donald trump to exhaust our fight and somehow come out of this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally , partially intact , then i , donald j. trump , will have demonstrated the greatness of america , just not the way i thought i was going to .
