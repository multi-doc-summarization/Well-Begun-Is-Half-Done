electronic construction signs in the dallas area appear to have been hacked , displaying messages calling donald trump a reptile and imploring early morning commuters to take a day off work , the ap reports . the portable signs along interstate 30 and elsewhere flashed various messages early tuesday , including " donald trump is a ... shape shifting lizard ! " another message read , " bernie for president , " while still another sign said : " work is canceled . go back home . " the signs appear to be ones used by the texas department of transportation , and it was n't the first time they were hacked : cbs-dfw notes that sometime over memorial day weekend , one of the signs had been changed to read " party hardy yall . " that message was removed by monday , and the sign was ostensibly secured by the contractor against further vandalism , a txdot rep saysâ€”but the new hacked messages popped up after someone again broke into the system late monday or early tuesday . and it 's not a snap-your-fingers task to fix , per nbc-dfw : the signs ca n't be operated remotely , so any modifications have to be done manually via the control panels . txdot tells dallas-fort worth broadcaster krld that there 's no humor in what the hackers did . the agency says the messages bumped warnings to motorists about nearby construction zones .
