actor randy quaid was arrested—along with his wife evi—friday night while trying to cross the canadian border into vermont , the cbc reports . according to the ap , the quaids were detained by us customs and border protection agents because they 're still wanted on felony charges from 2010 in california . the couple had been hiding up north since then , but the canadian government recently gave them until next wednesday to get out of the country . this is n't randy 's first arrest this week . he was detained last tuesday by canadian officials , who thought he might try to flee rather than leave canada , the cbc reports . the quaids first fled to canada in 2010 after being accused of vandalizing and squatting in the guesthouse of a home they once owned in california , the ap reports . they also claimed they were being targeted by the " hollywood star-whackers , " who they say killed their friends david carradine and heath ledger . according to the cbc , randy was denied permanent resident status in canada in 2013 because of the california charges . following his detention last tuesday , he told the ap he was finally ready to return to the us to settle the vandalism charges and move on with his life . while he was unavailable for comment following his arrest in vermont , we imagine randy 's long-awaited return to america went a little something like this .
