the " buried treasure " found by a california couple out walking their dog—an estimated $ 11 million worth of rare gold coins from the 1800s—has started to be auctioned off . last night at the old san francisco mint , an 1874 $ 20 double eagle sold for $ 15,000 , the ap reports . a few other coins were also auctioned there , and most of the remaining 1,400 are now on sale on amazon.com and kagins.com , according to the firm handling the sale . the anonymous couple , who found the coins on their own property , are also keeping a few . as for the money they make , they 'll pay bills and donate to local charities—and the money from last night 's auction will help turn the old san francisco mint into a museum . about 60 of the coins will be displayed there , usa today reports . it 's still not clear where the coins , most of which are in mint condition , came from—the numismatist who valued the coins and is handling the sale says theories ( none of which panned out ) have linked them to stagecoach bandit black bart , outlaw jesse james , and a heist at the san francisco mint . and , of course , there are people out there who claim the coins belonged to their distant relatives—one of whom has threatened to sue . but none of the stories so far is legit , according to federal officials .
