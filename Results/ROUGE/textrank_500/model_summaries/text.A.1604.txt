have masculine or feminine features ? a big smile ? characteristics like these , it seems , are central to our snap judgements of people 's faces . using a computer model , researchers have figured out how different features affect our first impressions , the bbc reports . the system is based on 1,000 pictures of different faces gathered online . in a study , researchers had respondents give opinions of these faces , focusing on approachability , dominance , and attractiveness . researchers then created a mathematical model that translated those opinions into distinct facial measurements—an effort to " crack the code of first impressions , " notes smithsonian . the result was a computer program that generates cartoon faces intended to be dominant or submissive , approachable or off-putting . another batch of study subjects offered their opinions of the cartoons—and they fit the computer 's assessments . masculine features and a good tan were apparently tied to the perception of dominance , while smiles were associated with approachability , livescience reports . knowing how first impressions work may be particularly important these days : " whereas in the past , we got to know people through meeting them in the flesh , increasingly , our first contact is online , and our first impressions are based on the images we provide on social media profiles , " says the study 's lead author . of course , what 's attractive could change a lot in the next century .
