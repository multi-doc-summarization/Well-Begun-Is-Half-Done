pandas may prefer their meals in the form of bamboo , but that does n't mean their bite is toothless . a man in china recently received a harsh reminder of that after a wild panda bit his leg after authorities pursued the critter onto his lawn , reports afp via yahoo . the creature had made its way into a northwestern village , which is near a sanctuary that 's home to about 100 wild pandas . " i saw a panda jump out in front of me , its body completely covered in mud , " the man told local news . a struggle ensued , in which the bear would n't release the man 's leg until a rescuer wrapped a coat around the animal 's head . finally , it fledâ€”but not before causing injuries which , china daily reports , led to eight surgeries over the past year and may lead to amputation . the man sued three government departments and won an $ 83,000 payout that will cover his medical costs , his lawyer says . ( china daily has a pretty gruesome photo of the injury . ) " as cuddly as they may look , a panda can protect itself as well as most other bears , " the world wildlife fund notes , per afp . indeed , panda attacks have led to some nasty consequences in the past .
