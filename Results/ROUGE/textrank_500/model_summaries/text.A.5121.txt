in a rare bit of good news in the animal conservation world , scientists say they vastly lowballed the penguin population on antarctica . the off-base estimate pertains to adelie penguins—that 's the adorable happy feet variety—and it turns out there are 3.6 million more of them than previously thought , reports the huffington post australia . a team of australian , japanese , and french scientists now think there are 5.9 million of these birds occupying a 3,100-mile stretch of east antarctica . from that projection , they pegged the total adelie penguin population on the continent at 14 million to 16 million . the adelies , named after the wife of the french explorer who discovered them in 1840 , are only found on antarctica and its islands . so why did their number take such a leap ? " the reason it 's higher is we have incorporated the non-breeding component of the population , " says aussie ecologist dr. louise emmerson . what that means is that while the breeding birds migrate to the island to do the deed and then sit on eggs , making them easy to count , non-breeders are " off foraging out in the water where we ca n't see them , " she says . it turns out the non-breeders were more numerous . how did the experts revise their count ? they used aerial surveillance and land-based counting methods , and they studied penguin droppings to ballpark the amount of food the tuxedoed ones consume : an estimated 213,000 tons of krill and 21,000 tons of fish during the breeding season , per the afp . the findings could help inform conservation efforts for marine and land animals , per the australian .
