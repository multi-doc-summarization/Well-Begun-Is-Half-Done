" they accuse her of adding " insult to a terrible injury " and say she refused to allow them in his tiburon , calif. , home in the days after his death . williams , who committed suicide in august , specified his estate go to his three children , but the dispute centers around a provision that the home , its contents , and enough cash to cover " all costs related to the residence " go to susan williams . the children accuse her of wrongly interpreting this to mean she can keep belongings she was never meant to have and of " greedily " trying to claim extra funds . sources tell tmz that the widow , who refers to williams ' collections of things like action figures and movie posters as " knickknacks , " also argues that " jewelry " does n't include things like watches . her lawyer tells the times that his client does n't have " sticky fingers " and " compared to what the williams children were set to receive from their father , this is a bucket of water in a lake .
