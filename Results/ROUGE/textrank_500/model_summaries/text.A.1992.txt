" why do sheep get frisky in winter ? " is n't the beginning of a bad joke , but rather the question that jump-started a joint study by researchers at the university of nottingham and the university of bristol . the guardian reports that scientists may now have an answer , one that could help farmers better control the breeding season . that answer , laid out in the journal pnas , is a bit complicated . it 's been known for some time that sheep 's fertility is tied to production of the hormone melatonin , but how melatonin communicates with the pituitary gland , which shoots off sex hormones , has been a mystery . " no one has been able to find what the link is , " says co-author david bates . until now , perhaps . press releases from nottingham and bristol explain what may solve this 30-year-old puzzle : a protein made in the pituitary gland called vascular endothelial growth factor . it 's made in two different forms , and scientists say melatonin controls which one surfaces . in the summer ( when melatonin is in shorter supply ) , vegf makes blood vessels grow and serves as a sheep-sex buzzkill of sorts . but in the winter , vegf blocks blood vessel growth—and also appears to trigger a sex hormone spike . “ now we know what that link is we can start to understand how it can be controlled , ” says bates . in addition to helping farmers , the study could lead to developments in studying hormonal and seasonal patterns in humans in regard to endocrine diseases . ( using your smartphone right before you turn in could mess with your melatonin levels . )
