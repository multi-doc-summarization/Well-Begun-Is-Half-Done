claims are coming in from multiple european countries that television manufacturers are pulling a volkswagen and installing software to cheat energy-efficiency tests , the bbc reports . an eu-funded lab presented findings tuesday that showed televisions manufactured by samsung—the largest television manufacturer in the world—cut their energy consumption nearly in half during efficiency tests through their " motion lighting " feature , which would activate under test conditions but not under normal viewing . critics are comparing it to this month 's volkswagen scandal , in which the company installed software to fool emissions tests , according to the guardian . “ there is no comparison , ” a samsung spokesperson says . “ this is not a setting that only activates during compliance testing . " earlier this year , the swedish energy council complained to the european commission that another , unnamed television manufacturer had sets that recognized the standard test video and immediately dimmed to cut energy use when the video started , the bbc reports . and the united kingdom complained about similar " defeat software " in televisions three years ago , according to the guardian . televisions in europe account for the equivalent of the total electrical consumption of sweden and portugal every year . if televisions are cheating efficiency tests , that means energy consumption , electricity bills , and carbon emissions are all higher than advertised . the european commission says it will be investigating the claims .
