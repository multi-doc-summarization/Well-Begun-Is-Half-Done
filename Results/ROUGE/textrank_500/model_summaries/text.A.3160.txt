the lower chamber of brazil 's congress has begun debate on whether to impeach president dilma rousseff , with the crucial vote slated for sunday , the ap reports . the government had carried out an unsuccessful bid before the country 's supreme court to try to halt the process , but that appeal was lost , reuters notes . the atmosphere in the lower chamber of deputies was electric at the start of friday 's session , with some congressmen chanting " dilma out ! " before proceedings began . lawmakers backing impeachment allege rousseff 's administration violated fiscal rules . they say the government used sleight-of-hand accounting in a bid to shore up public support . however , many of those pushing for impeachment face grave accusations of corruption themselves . rousseff 's defenders insist she did nothing illegal and say similar accounting techniques were used by previous presidents . the country 's attorney general called the whole procedure " kafka-esque " and said it meant rousseff would n't be able to fully defend herself , al jazeera reports . if 342 of the lower house 's 513 legislators vote in favor of impeachment , the process moves to the senate , which would decide whether to open a trial . if the senate moves to impeach rousseff , she would be swapped out with brazil 's vice president , michel temer , as soon as may since she would be suspended from office for up to 180 days during the trial .
