almost 30 years after he went missing from a group home in kitchener , ontario , at the age of 21 , edgar latulip remembered something very important last month : his name . police say the 50-year-old , who has a developmental delay and functions at a child 's level , has spent the last 30 years living in st. catharines , around 80 miles from where he disappeared , ctv reports . from what investigators can piece together , latulip took a bus to niagara falls in september 1986 and ended up in st. catharines , where he suffered a head injury and " effectively forgot who he was " until this year , when he told a social worker he remembered . before his disappearance , latulip had attempted suicide at least once , leading to fears he may have killed himself . police officer duane gingerich , who investigated the disappearance , tells the guelph mercury that he 's thrilled that latulip has turned up alive . " i had hopes that he was out there somewhere , " he says . " for us as investigators , this is great , this is awesome . it 's satisfying because most of these cases do n't turn out this way . you expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time . " a dna test confirmed latulip 's identity and police say a reunion with his mother , who moved to ottawa years ago , is being arranged . in a 2014 interview , she told the mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance . " this is always at the back of my mind . having an answer would mean closure , " she said . ( a california hospital recently identified the man it had called " garage 66 " for 16 years . )
