after suffering painful red rashes on their backsides , a husband and wife were left red in the face—so much so that a case study of their ordeal has now been pulled from the prestigious british medical journal . as bmj tells the washington post , the british pair whose bottoms became infested with hookworm larvae on a beach in martinique initially agreed to the jan. 13 publication of their case , as well as photos of " red pinprick marks " on their backsides . though their names were never mentioned , the pair " indicated their understanding that complete anonymity could not be guaranteed " and were warned journalists might pick up the story , bmj says . but when that happened—with headlines like " his and her hookworm : same rash strikes couple on the rear " —the pair had a change of heart . with the spread of photos and case details—including the woman 's age , the couple 's caribbean destination , the cruise line on which they traveled , and the cambridge hospital they visited—one of the pair asked that the article be withdrawn over concerns " about being identified by close friends and/or colleagues , " bmj says . in what the post calls a " highly unusual 'correction , ' " the journal then announced it was pulling the article despite standing by its content . as the independent reports , the article was meant to helpful in combating a lack of familiarity in the medical community with hookworm infections . according to the cdc , such infections can be passed through contact with soil or sand contaminated with feces . as the bmj study explained , the british couple were infected when they sat on a sandy , and apparently unsanitary , beach .
