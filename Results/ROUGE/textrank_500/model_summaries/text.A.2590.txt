in a deeply unfortunate gaffe for donald trump on the eve of new york 's gop primary , he managed to get the date of 9/11 wrong . " i was down there and i watched our police and our firemen , down on 7-11 , down at the world trade center , right after it came down , and i saw the greatest people i 've ever seen in action , " he told a monday night rally in buffalo , ny , per the hill . " i saw the bravest people i 've ever seen , including the construction workers , including every person down there . " trump—who went on to slam " lyin ' ted cruz , " " crooked hillary clinton , " and " stupid trade deals " like nafta—still received plenty of cheers from what the buffalo news calls an " adoring " and wildly enthusiastic crowd at the first niagara center , where he was introduced by buffalo bills head coach rex ryan . according to a marist poll released on saturday , trump has a 29-point lead in new york , with 54 % support to 25 % for john kasich . ted cruz is third with 16 % . ( cruz was almost completely ignored when he spoke at the new york state republican gala last week . )
