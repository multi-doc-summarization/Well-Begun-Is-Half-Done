soon you may no longer have to choose between treating your hangover with coffee or the hair of the dog . science reports that scientists have successfully spun used coffee grounds into booze , in a process that sounds relatively straightforward . they dried the spent grounds ( which , in this case , came from a portuguese roaster ) then added water and cooked the mixture at 163°c for 45 minutes . the liquid was pulled out , dosed with sugar and yeast , and given time to ferment . in order to make it boozier—read , 40 % ethanol—the result was concentrated in a process science likens to that of distilling spirits . but what would such a discovery be without a taste test ? the eight " trained " testers who sampled it reported coffee aromas and a bitter taste . they thought age would actually improve it , but ranked it as palatable . ( smithsonian adds that the scientists described it " as having features of a pleasant beverage . " ) what it 's not : caffeinated . most is eliminated as the drink is brewed .
