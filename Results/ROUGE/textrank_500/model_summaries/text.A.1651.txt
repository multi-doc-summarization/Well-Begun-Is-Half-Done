the physical activity council has a list of 104 physical activities—which do not include lifting 12 ounces of bud lite but do include table tennis , golf , and walking—in its annual survey of our activity habits , released yesterday . and the number of americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us : that 's 83 million people , or 28 % of the us population over the age of 6 , reports the wall street journal . " we feel confident , in a sad way , that this is the largest number we ’ ve ever seen , " says pac member and sports and fitness industry association exec tom cove , who adds it 's the most dismal result he 's seen in 24 years . the number of completely sedentary americans increased by 18 % since 2007 . that 's not to say we do n't like the appearance of fitness , just the actuality of it : the journal notes the rise of " athleisure " apparel ; such footwear saw sales jump 8 % in the year ending april 11 , while performance shoes took an 18 % dive . the pac traces the decline to our schools , which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess . another problem ? the increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines . says cove : " there are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9 , 10 , 11 , because they simply have to make a decision : am i going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this , or are there other things that i want to do ? " ( an editorial argues that it 's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic , it 's the food industry 's unhealthy products . )
