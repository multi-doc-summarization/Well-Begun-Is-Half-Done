aviation enthusiasts spotted three mystery planes over amarillo , texas , earlier this month , and buzzed online about what they had seen , fox news reports . initially they thought b-2 bombers had flown by on the afternoon of march 10 , but the aircraft lacked the b-2 's w-shaped back . they " loosely resembled " the navy 's new x-47b killer drone , but were too big , the aviationist reports . which leaves what , exactly ? " if i had to guess , i 'd say we took a picture of a stealthy transport aircraft , " said one of the enthusiasts , steve douglass . he blogs in greater detail , saying the us military may be trotting out new planes ( probably piloted ) to make its enemies shiver or go broke trying to replicate them . this last happened when the world took note of the air force 's f-117 , and " the soviet union went bankrupt " seeking " ways to counter stealth , " writes douglass . " ask yourself an important questionâ€”what 's going on in the world right now ? " he asks . " who ( has of late ) has decided to roll back the clock to the good old days of the cold war and mad ? " another analyst looks at " gaps in the usaf 's line-up " for answers , noting that the air force has sought a " penetrating , stand-in electronic attack " for its strike systems ; see that analysis at aviation week .
