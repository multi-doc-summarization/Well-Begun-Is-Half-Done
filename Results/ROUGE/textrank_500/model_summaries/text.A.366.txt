last month , reports emerged about a strange workplace hazard at apple 's sleek new headquarters in cupertino . it seems that people keep walking head first into the glass walls at apple park . now the san francisco chronicle confirms the news via 911 calls on three separate incidents in early january . some highlights : first call : " we had an individual who ran into a glass wall pane and they hit their head . they have a small cut on their head and they are bleeding , slightly disoriented . " second call : " so we had an employee , he was on campus and he walked into a glass window , hitting his head , has a little bit of a cut on the eyebrow . " when the dispatcher asks if the blood is " spurting or pouring out , " the caller clarifies : " i think it ’ s just leaking … a small cut . " third call : " um , i walked into a glass door on the first floor of apple park when i was trying to go outside , which was very silly . " the dispatcher seeks clarity : " you walked through a glass door ? " no , the caller responds . " i didn ’ t walk through a glass door . i walked into a glass door . " as gizmodo explains , apple wanted an innovative design to allow workers to move around quickly with few distractions , " which sounds great until they started bonking into invisible barriers . " ( a job application steve jobs filled out in 1973 had some errors . )
