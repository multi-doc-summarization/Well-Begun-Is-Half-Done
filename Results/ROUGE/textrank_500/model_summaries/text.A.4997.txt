a california high school student made a find livescience calls " amazing " : while doing paleontology fieldwork for school in utah in 2009 , kevin terris helped to discover an almost complete baby parasaurolophus skeleton—in fact , the most complete one ever found . nicknamed " joe , " it also turned out to be the smallest and youngest parasaurolophus fossil ever found at under a year old and 6 feet long . the herbivore is known for its tube-shaped head crest , and this one was so young the crest is just a bump . " we now understand a lot more about how parasaurolophus grew its crest , " says a paleontologist . specifically , the fact that the crest was already in existence on such a young dinosaur suggests that parasaurolophus crests started growing earlier than those of other duck-billed dinosaurs . " it finally lets us understand how parasaurolophus evolved that big crest , just by shifting around events in its development , " the paleontologist says . why so much time between the discovery and its reporting ? the team could n't even dig up the bones until 2010 , because of the need for permits , and it took 1,300 hours of cleaning and chiseling to unearth the fossil—the completeness of which is " pretty spectacular , " according to the paleontologist . fun side note : terris spotted the first bone after two professional paleontologists walked right by it , which one of them tells nbc news is " a little embarrassing . "
