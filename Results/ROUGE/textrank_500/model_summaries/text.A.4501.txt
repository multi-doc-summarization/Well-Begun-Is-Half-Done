marrion p'udongo is recognized simply as " pastor " by many and has pulled off a laundry list of heroic acts in the war-torn republic of the congo , including assisting child soldiers and rape victims and helping manage an orphanage , per nbc news . his other nickname , the " schindler of congo , " came about after a 2003 massacre of ethnic hema residents in bunia by ethnic lendu militiamen : p'udongo housed 70 or so frightened hema for about a week , but militiamen forced their way in and threatened to kill everyone—until p'udongo successfully pleaded for their lives and they were all brought to safety . but now the people 's savior is the one who needs help as he languishes in uganda hooked up to a dialysis machine , the result of a failing kidney he received in a 2011 transplant . but while a new donor has been secured and a hospital in india with a high success rate for his type of procedure is ready to perform it , the $ 35,000 price tag is overwhelming for p'udongo , who makes $ 200 a month , nbc notes . the people he 's touched are doing whatever they can to help him : the same reporter who helped fundraise for the pastor in 2011 is doing it again . " look at the world right now … you do n't see a lot of really good people left , " bryan mealer says on generosity.com . " this is one of them . " p'udongo even has a friend in hollywood : ben affleck , who founded advocacy group eastern congo initiative and met p'udongo in 2008 , when the actor visited northeastern congo . meanwhile , p'udongo continues to fight , mostly for his wife , four kids , an orphan he 's taken in , and all the others he advocates for . " if i am not there … who will fill that gap ? " he says to nbc . " no , i should not die now … there 's still a lot to do . " ( read what bryan mealer wrote about the pastor in 2011 for the huffington post . )
