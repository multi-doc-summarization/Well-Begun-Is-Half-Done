a us balloonist who was trying to cross the atlantic ocean using hundreds of helium-filled balloons has landed short of his goal in newfoundland . with sense of humor intact : " this does n't look like france , " he posted on facebook . the canadian broadcasting corp. reported today that it used a helicopter to retrieve jonathan trappe from the remote area where he landed a night earlier . " it 's not the destination i set out for , but it 's kind of the way with real adventure , " trappe told the cbc . " adventure is n't what you planned on , it 's what you find , and that 's what we have today . " trappe landed safely in a rugged area near york harbour after reporting that he was having trouble controlling his balloons yesterday evening , according to the royal canadian mounted police . instead of using a conventional hot-air balloon , trappe was using more than 300 colorful helium-filled balloons , like those used in the animated movie up . he said his calculations indicated he was n't going to make it to europe , so he decided to set down on land before crossing over open ocean .
