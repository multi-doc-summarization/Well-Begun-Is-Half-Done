emma stone ruled the roost last year , but this time around she 's lost the no . 1 spot on the highest-paid actress list to the black widow . that would be scarlett johansson , whose annual paycheck is leaps and bounds ahead of the runner-up by more than $ 12 million , per forbes : the avengers star brought in $ 40.5 million pretax between june 1 , 2017 , and june 1 of this year . forbes notes that the combined pay of the 10 top-paid actresses grossed $ 186 million , as well as another interesting tidbit on these high-paid hollywooders : a full 60 % of the women on this list are over the age of 40 , turning the tables on the " young ingenue " routine that often relegates older women in tinseltown to less-palatable roles . rounding out the top five after johansson : scarlett johansson , $ 40.5m angelina jolie , $ 28m jennifer aniston , $ 19.5m jennifer lawrence , $ 18m reese witherspoon , $ 16.5m see who else made the list here . ( there are zero women on this highest-paid athletes list . )
