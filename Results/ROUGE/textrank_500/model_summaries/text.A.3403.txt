if you 've ever dreamed of being a superhero , there may soon be reason to join the army . it 's developing a " revolutionary " armor that " promises to provide superhuman strength with greater ballistic protection , " livescience reports . the tactical assault light operator suit would include a bulletproof exoskeleton frame ; sensors to monitor heart rate and hydration , detect injuries , and even apply foam to seal wounds ; and a computer that includes 360-degree night-vision cameras . the army is calling on multiple industries , government labs , and research organizations to make it happen , reports the bbc . if it sounds to you like the stuff of movies , or perhaps comic books , you 're not alone . " it sounds exactly like iron man , " a professor at mit told npr for an earlier story , noting the use of hydraulics on the arms and legs to increase strength and speed . like most superheroes , however , talos has a weakness . " for the army 's talos , the weak spot is either the need to carry around a heavy pump for a hydraulic system , or lots of heavy batteries , " says the prof. " we do n't have iron man 's power source yet . " the army hopes a prototype will be ready by next year , though an advanced model could be a few years off .
