as he came out of an atlanta gas station saturday night after paying for his fill-up , lestor chaney was overwhelmed with a feeling no parent ever wants to experience : complete fear , abc news reports . chaney tells wsb ( which spells his first name " lester " ) he went inside the texaco to pay after his card would n't go through at the pump , and when he emerged , he saw a man hopping into his toyota camry and speeding off . but it was n't just his car being stolen that stopped his heartâ€”it was the fact that his twin 1-year-old girls , nadia and mckenzie , were inside . " i ran to unlock the door , but the door was locked or whatever and the guy took off , " he says ( abc news has the surveillance footage that shows that terrifying moment ) . it 's not known if the carjacker was aware of the babies snuggled in their car seats in the back when he boosted the camry , but it would appear not , as the car and the girls were found , uninjured , by cops about a quarter-mile away in the parking lot of an apartment complex . mckenzie was still dozing off in her car seat in the car , and nadia , who had been taken out of the car and placed in a wooded area , was still snoozing as well . chaney , who admits he left the car running when he went inside to pay , is now breathing a huge sigh of relief . " i was just hoping they were going to be alright , " he says . ( this mom made a literal leap of faith when her car was carjacked with her kids inside . )
