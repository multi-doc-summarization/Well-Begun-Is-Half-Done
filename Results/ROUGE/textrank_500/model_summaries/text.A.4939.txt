workers in japan put in notoriously long hours , and the country appears to be paying a price : stressed out workers and resulting health problems , including suicide . as the japan times notes , there 's even a word for it : " karoshi , " or " death by overwork . " now japan is designating the last friday of every month as " premium friday , " with employees encouraged to sign out at 3pm—and maybe do a little shopping to jump-start their weekend and possibly a lagging economy , reports the london times . the move is n't mandatory for companies , but the nation 's biggest business lobby is on board and encouraging its members to take part when it launches on feb. 24 . it does n't help that most workers in japan tend to use only half their allotted paid time off , and that an estimated one in eight work 50 hours or more—the highest percentage among g-7 nations . so it remains unclear whether premium friday will be a sufficient break for the overworked , or even attainable for those who must squeeze in their work at other times . fortune is skeptical , calling it an " essentially meaningless " scheme . it quotes a critic who says the bigger issue to focus on is efficiency to cut down on those long work weeks , which are " still considered a virtue . " another problem is that japan has lots of small , family-run businesses where shortened hours could be a problem , notes the bbc . ( a japanese ceo resigned after a young woman 's suicide . )
