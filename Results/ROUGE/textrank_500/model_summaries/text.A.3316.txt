sun feel a little off to you these days ? congratulations on being finely attuned to the inner workings of the solar system . the sun is in the process of reversing its magnetic fields , and the full process should be complete before the year is out , reports space.com . it may sound like a doomsday plot twist , but the reversal occurs every 11 years at the peak of the sun 's solar cycle , explains the huffington post . " the sun 's polar magnetic fields weaken , go to zero , and then emerge again with the opposite polarity , " says stanford physicist phil scherrer . in fact , " the sun 's north pole has already changed sign , while the south pole is racing to catch up . " the peak of the cycle usually is associated with an increase in sunspots and solar flares , but this year 's peak is relatively tame . the flip , then , should occur with most earthlings being none the wiser .
