the number of ohio state wrestlers who 've come forward to say rep. jim jordan knew about abuse at the hands of their team doctor is rising , despite jordan 's adamant denials . after an initial report on three former wrestlers , nbc news interviews a fourth accuser , shawn dailey , who says he was groped several times by dr. richard strauss in the mid-'90s , when jordan was the team 's assistant coach . " it was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to dr. strauss for anything , you would have to pull your pants down , " dailey , now 43 , says , adding he never approached jordan about his own abuse but took part in locker room discussions about strauss with jordan . dailey specifically backs up the account of former teammate dunyasha yetts , saying jordan 's reply to yetts after yetts complained about strauss was : " if he tried that with me , i would kill him . " dailey notes he 's a republican , like jordan , whom he calls a " close friend " and " good guy " whose campaign he donated to in 1994 . still , " what happened drove me out of the sport , " he says . " so i was surprised to hear jim say that he knew nothing about it . … that 's kind of hurtful . " former ufc champ mark coleman also speaks out , telling the wall street journal " there 's no way unless [ jordan 's ] got dementia or something that he 's got no recollection of what was going on at ohio state . … i have nothing but respect for this man , i love this man , but he knew as far as i 'm concerned . " meanwhile , president trump has weighed in , telling reporters thursday that he believes jordan " 100 % , no question in my mind . " " jim jordan is one of the most outstanding people i 've met since i 've been in washington , " trump said , adding he does n't believe the allegations against him " at all . "
