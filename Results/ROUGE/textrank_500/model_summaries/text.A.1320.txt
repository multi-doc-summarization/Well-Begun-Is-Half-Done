a michigan conference called to discuss a possible " honor killing " and women in islam has triggered an uproar from local muslims and civil rights groups who say it 's an excuse to bash islam . the " jessica mokdad human rights conference on honor killings " in dearborn—home to a thriving american muslim community—was immediately countered with a " rejecting islamophobia : a community stand against hate " town hall meeting in detroit , notes msnbc . both meetings took place yesterday . mokdad , 20 , was killed last year by her muslim stepdad , according to police . though initially reported as a suspected honor killing , investigators now believe mokdad was killed because she was about to tell police her stepfather was sexually abusing her , according to the detroit free press . " the evidence shows the motive really was not a cultural issue , " said a lead investigator . " it 's about power , control , and rape . " the honor killing conference immediately raised suspicions because it was organized by pam geller , critic of islam and nationally known foe of the proposed ground zero mosque . geller insists mokdad 's death was an honor killing , and one more example of " stealth enforcement " of islamic shariah law . geller 's group stop the islamization of america has been classified as a hate group by the southern poverty law center . organizers of the rival meeting said in a statement it 's time for " our community to take a stand , along with those who value america 's commitment to diversity and freedom of religion . " said a female speaker at the town hall meeting : " as a muslim woman , i stand with pride in my faith . "
