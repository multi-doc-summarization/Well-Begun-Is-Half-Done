losing weight is one thing , keeping it off quite another . and now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease ( chd ) —which the mayo clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke , heart attack , and death . reporting in the new england journal of medicine , researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with chd between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years , monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes . the takeaway ? " it 's important to lose weight , but this data says you have to keep it off , " lead researcher dr. sripal bangalore at the new york university school of medicine tells the new york times . the highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years , while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds , reports medical news today . those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124 % more deaths , 136 % more strokes , and 117 % more heart attacks , meaning these chd patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with chd whose weight only fluctuated two pounds . this does n't pinpoint a cause , as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit , but researchers hope to study this correlation further . ( yo-yo dieting is bad for women 's hearts in general . )
