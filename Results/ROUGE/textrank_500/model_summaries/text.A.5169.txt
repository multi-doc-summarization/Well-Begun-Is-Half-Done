a nation away from new york 's wall street , thousands of sympathetic california protesters thronged the streets of oakland yesterday and shut down the city 's port in the most vigorous anti-corporate demonstration of the past weeks . moms and dads , the jobless , students and union members joined together for a day-long protest and general strike that ended in a march to the port where activists blocked shipments , effectively closing operations accounting for some $ 8.5 million in business a day , reports the los angeles times . protesters also blocked intersections and pounded on the windows of banks , forcing some to close . " this is a warning , a test , to the 1 % . we do n't need them , they need us , " one of the protesters told the guardian . police announced earlier they had made no arrests and the protest was largely peaceful , but cops were keeping careful watch as the night progressed . “ the world is watching oakland tonight . we need to make sure this remains a safe place for everyone , ” said city administrator deanna santana . initially , police were notably restrained just days after a rubber bullet shot by cops fractured the skull of former marine scott olsen , who is still hospitalized with serious head trauma . but the oakland tribune was reporting that a squad of police appeared to be moving in to shut down the occupy oakland encampment after midnight , and were firing tear gas cannisters .
