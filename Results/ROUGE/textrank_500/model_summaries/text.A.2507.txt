got the blues ? you probably are n't seeing blues clearly . that 's the takeaway from a new study that finds how a person views the color blue may actually depend on mood , reports medical daily . not all colors were affected in the same way . researchers at the university of rochester asked 129 college students to watch either a stand-up comedy clip or the scene from the lion king in which mufasa dies , then recorded the participants ' moods , per the washington post . next , participants took a color accuracy test in which they had to look at 48 color patches that had been desaturated to look nearly gray , then identify whether each was red , yellow , green , or blue . people who were feeling down in the dumps performed worse than those who were amused . in other words , the data supports " the conventional wisdom that people 's emotions influence how colorful the world looks to them , " the researchers say . however , the sad group performed poorly only when quizzed about colors on what researchers call the blue-yellow axis . they could identify colors on the red-green axis just as well as others—perhaps due to the evolutionary need to see red as a sign of anger , reports time . the results are " a reminder that our experience of the world is not as immediate and objective as we ’ d like to believe , " observes the post . researchers suggest a sad mood messes up the ability of the neuron transmitter dopamine to process information about blue-yellow colors .
