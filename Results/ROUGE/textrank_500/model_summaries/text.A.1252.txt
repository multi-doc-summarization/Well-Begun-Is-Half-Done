after offering a gitmo compromise to president obama , lindsey graham got called everything from a " cretin " to someone making a " deal with the devil " this week by his fellow republicans . that 's just business as usual for graham , whose designation may as well be " r-no man 's land , " writes dana milbank . graham seems genuinely concerned with getting things right than with blindly sticking to some ideological purity test , and that , sadly , makes him an " oddball " on capitol hill . " though graham does n't have to face primary voters until 2014 , his defiance of the gop purity police is still courageous , " writes milbank in the washington post . " his republican colleagues in congress , wetting their pants out of fear of the tea party movement , show no sign of joining him . "
