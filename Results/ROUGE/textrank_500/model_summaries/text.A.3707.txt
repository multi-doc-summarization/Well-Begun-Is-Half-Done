uber says it 's now making " house calls , " at least for one day . the ride-sharing service says that after the success of last year 's program , it is offering flu shots to people in 35 cities for $ 10 between 11am and 3pm on thursday , nov. 19 , the washington post reports . the shot—technically free , as long as a $ 10 " wellness pack " is purchased—comes with a nurse , who will actually deliver up to 10 shots with the purchase of that single pack , meaning you and your co-workers can take care of business for the low , low cost of $ 1 each . of course , there may be a tussle over who gets to keep the pack , which includes an uberhealth-branded water bottle and tote , tissues , hand sanitizer , and a lollipop . those who select the uberhealth option via their app are asked to " select a suitable indoor location prior to uberhealth arriving , " and the shot may be administered to those ages 4 and up . the nurses will be provided by a company called passport health , which will share the costs of the program with uber and health data-mining firm epidemico , reports the chicago tribune . it adds that 10,000 shots will be available ; 2,000 vaccinations were given in just four cities by uber last year . instructions on how to take part , and a list of all the cities covered , can be found on uber 's " uberhealth " page . ( last month , uber drivers delivered something soft and fuzzy to cuddle-craving users in 50 cities . )
