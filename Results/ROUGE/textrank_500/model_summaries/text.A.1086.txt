" police and power company investigators have visited the house , which the family had lived in for around 15 months . experts say that when a dryer gives off an electrical shock to the touch , it is a sign of one or more common but potentially lethal electrical issues , the fort-worth star-telegram reports . greenlee 's grieving parents say there 's no reason their daughter should be gone . " landlords need to be held accountable for the conditions of the homes that they let people live in , " mother shelby roos tells ksla . " all we want is a voice for our daughter who left us over a senseless act .
