in joyce bruce 's mind , robert boardwine was just an old friend who helpfully agreed to donate sperm so she could have a child—no parental rights attached . to boardwine , however , and now according to a virginia court , he 's entitled to see his young son , cnn reports . the virginia court of appeals ' decision yesterday came down to semantics : in its judgment , the use of a turkey baster , which how bruce inseminated herself with boardwine 's sperm in 2010 , is n't enough to keep him out of the picture as the dad , per a virginia reproduction statute , the washington post reports . bruce contended that because the couple never had sex and instead used " noncoital reproductive technology , " she was entitled to sole parenthood , per cnn . the court disagreed , writing in its decision : " the plain meaning of the term 'medical technology ' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster . " after making the conception plan , the couple 's friendship started going south in october 2010 ( a few months into the pregnancy ) when they disagreed over baby names . she did n't call him when the baby was born , but when he found out , he started visiting . bruce says those visits were " strained , " however , and she asked him to stop coming , which is when he sued for parental rights . boardwine concedes the two agreed bruce would be the main parent , but he says they also agreed he could see the child as he pleased—all conditions they never agreed to in writing . the court awarded him joint legal custody and visitation . ( a twist in a similar case : a kansas sperm donor was forced to pay child support . )
