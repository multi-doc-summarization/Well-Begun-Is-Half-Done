as expected , bill de blasio will easily finish first in new york city 's democratic primary for mayor , reports the ap . what 's unclear is whether he will get the necessary 40 % to avoid a runoff with the second-place finisher . with 97 % of returns in , de blasio had 40.02 % , bill thompson 26 % , and christine quinn 15 % . trailing those three were city comptroller john liu ( 7 % ) and , yes , anthony weiner ( 5 % ) . the eventual democratic winner will face former mta chief ( and rudy giuliani deputy ) joe lhota in the general election in november . he won the gop race over billionaire john catsimatidis . there will be a recount of yesterday 's ballots , and some 30,000 votes , including absentee ballots , still need to be counted a first time . a final result may not be known for 10 days and thompson has made it clear that he wo n't drop out in the name of party unity : he chanted " three more weeks ! " at his election night event , referring to a time before a potential runoff , which polls show he would lose . exit polls showed that de blasio , the city 's public advocate , did well with a wide swath of voters from different ethnic groups and locales , reports the new york times . more so than the other candidates , he advocated a clean break from michael bloomberg , making a particular issue of bloomberg 's stop-and-frisk policy . the mayor interjected himself into the campaign when he accused de blasio of running a " racist " campaignâ€”in part because the candidate featured his afro-sporting teen son in a tv ad . de blasio is white , his wife is black , and he would be first city mayor with an interracial family , notes the times .
