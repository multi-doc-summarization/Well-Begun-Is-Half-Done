how to figure out what vladimir putin might be up to next ? you might stare into his eyes to plumb his soul , as george w. bush famously did . or you can spend serious money to study his body language , as the pentagon has done . defense officials confirmed yesterday that they 've commissioned two such studies , one in 2008 and the other in 2012 , reports nbc news . in fact , the pentagon has shelled out $ 300,000 since 2009 to study the body movements of putin and other world figures , though no americans are among them . it 's called the " body leads " project , and usa today explains that it builds off research that first emerged in the 1940s . here 's a taste : researchers " believed each individual has a unique 'body signature ' consisting of how one body movement links to the next . these 'posture/gesture mergers ' can lead investigators to learn more about a person 's thinking processes and relative truthfulness when matched with what the person says . " sound a little strange ? apparently , the pentagon itself thinks so . the studies " have not informed any policy decisions of the department of defense , ‚Äù the pentagon 's press secretary insisted yesterday . he added that defense chief chuck hagel has n't read the studies of putin , notes the wall street journal .
