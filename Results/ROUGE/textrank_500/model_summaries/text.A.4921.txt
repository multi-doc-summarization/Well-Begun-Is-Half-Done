if the nba did n't have a certified sensation on its hands before last night , it does now . harvard wunderkind jeremy lin scored 38 points to lead the new york knicks past kobe bryant 's los angeles lakers , reports ap . unfamiliar with lin ? he is only the fourth asian-american to play in the nba and the first us-born player of taiwanese or chinese descent to do so , notes abc news in a profile . and up until last week , he 'd been a bench-warmer who got overlooked in the draft . then came a monster week for the point guard , who seems to have single-handedly revived the knicks ' fortunes en route to become the city 's new sports darling . ( chants of " mvp " were going up last night . ) his marketing potential is off the charts , notes abc . even bryant is impressed : " i think it 's a great story . i think it 's a testament to perseverance and hard work . good example for kids everywhere .
