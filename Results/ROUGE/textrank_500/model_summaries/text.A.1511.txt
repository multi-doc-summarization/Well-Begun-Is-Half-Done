the rock world is mourning lemmy kilmister , the hard-living motörhead frontman who once seemed almost indestructible . lemmy , as his legions of fans knew him , discovered he had cancer on saturday—just two days after his 70th birthday—and died on monday , the bbc reports . the british-born rocker , a former jimi hendrix roadie , formed motörhead in 1975 when he was kicked out of hawkwind after a drug bust in canada . " our mighty , noble friend lemmy passed away today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer , " the band said on its facebook page . " we will say more in the coming days , but for now , please ... play motörhead loud , play hawkwind loud , play lemmy 's music loud . have a drink or few . " lemmy , who made a total of 22 albums with motörhead , including the 1980 classic " ace of spades , " rocked—and partied—as hard as anybody in the business , though despite the band 's massive influence on thrash metal and other genres , he never cared for the term " heavy metal , " feeling more kinship with punk bands like the damned , reports the cbc . health problems did n't slow him down much in later years : the band completed a north american tour in september and was due to begin a european one in january . in august , he told the guardian that death was the only thing that could stop him . " as long as i can walk the few yards from the back to the front of the stage without a stick , " he said . " or even if i do have to use a stick . " ( we also lost " louie louie " singer jack ely this year . )
