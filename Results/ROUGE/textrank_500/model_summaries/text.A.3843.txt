the three american hikers detained by iran weren ’ t captured in iraq , says sarah shourd : they were beckoned over the border by an armed soldier , she tells the new york times in an effort to set the wikileaks version of the story straight . “ we did not actually enter iran until he gestured to us . we were confused and worried and wanted to go back . " in shourd 's fullest account of her ordeal to date , she goes into detail about their fateful overnight camping trip , describing " scores of campfires " near the waterfall they were hiking to—which abutted iran . “ i think we were extremely unlucky , ” says shourd . “ i guess i never believed there would be so many hundreds of people close to a border. ” her interview with the times comes ahead of a court date for her fellow hikers , which was set for saturday but has been delayed by iran until shourd “ can return to iran or , ” if she refuses , her case can “ be dealt with differently , ” said an iranian official . but her lawyer says the trial should go forward ; neither he nor shourd , he tells reuters , were notified of the change .
