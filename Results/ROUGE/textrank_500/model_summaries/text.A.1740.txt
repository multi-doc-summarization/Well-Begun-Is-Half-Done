legal marijuana is taking tourism in colorado to new highs , if a new study is to be believed . the denver post reports a study commissioned by the colorado tourism office found nearly 49 % of colorado visitors between april and september came at least in part because of pot . " i think it is rearing its head as a significant travel and tourism amenity for visitors coming to colorado , " a former tourism office head says . the survey also showed 20 % of potential tourists were more likely to visit colorado because of legal weed compared to 15 % who were less likely . somewhat surprisingly , only 8 % of tourists surveyed admitted to actually visiting a marijuana dispensary while in the state . a smaller study out of fort lewis college found most tourists come to colorado for other reasons , but legal marijuana is " the icing on the cake , " the durango herald reports . according to the post , colorado has welcomed a record number of tourists in the past two years . prior to the study , tourism officials had been crediting that increase solely to " savvy marketing . " the colorado tourism office spent more than $ 5.3 million on a new advertising campaign , which does n't mention pot at all , colorado public radio reports . but it should n't be that way , the owner of one pot tourism company tells the post : " the state of colorado has had an amazing opportunity to embrace this industry . it is a complete advantage for colorado to become the napa valley and sonoma county of cannabis .
