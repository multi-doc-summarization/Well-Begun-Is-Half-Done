the white house has walked back comments made by president trump on friday that he would not sign a " moderate " immigration reform bill scheduled for a vote next week . a spokesman said trump had misunderstood the question and does indeed back the measure , reports politico . the tumult erupted as gop leaders put the finishing touches on a pair of republican bills : a hard-right proposal and a middle-ground plan negotiated by the party 's conservative and moderate wings , with white house input . only the compromise bill would open a door to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the us illegally as children ( " dreamers " ) , and reduce the separation of children from their parents when families are detained crossing the border . when asked about the bills friday in a fox news interview , trump said , " i certainly would n't sign the more moderate one . " but a senior white house official later said trump had misspoken and believed his fox interviewer was asking about an effort by gop moderates—abandoned for now—that would have forced votes on a handful of bills and likely led to house passage of liberal-leaning versions party leaders oppose , per the ap . the white house later put out a statement formally endorsing the " moderate " measure now in the works . earlier this week , paul ryan had said the president was on board with it . trump also weighed in by tweet , writing that any bill " must have " provisions financing his proposed wall with mexico and curbing the existing legal immigration system . those items are included in the middle-ground package . democrats are expected to solidly oppose both gop bills , giving republicans little leeway for losing support .
