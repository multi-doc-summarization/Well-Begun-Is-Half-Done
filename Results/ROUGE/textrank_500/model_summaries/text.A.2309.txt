president trump 's intervention in joe arpaio 's fate dates back well before he announced the controversial pardon of the former arizona sheriff on friday , reports the washington post . citing white house sources , the post reports that trump reached out to ag jeff sessions this past spring to see if the government could drop the criminal case against arpaio , but " was advised that would be inappropriate . " sarah huckabee sanders addressed trump 's inquiry , calling it " only natural the president would have a discussion with administration lawyers about legal matters . " trump acquiesced , but planned to issue the pardon in the event of a conviction , which came at the end of july . " we knew the president wanted to do this for some time now , " one white house staffer tells the post . another adviser tells politico it was n't a " matter of if he was going to do it , it was a matter of when . " despite his earlier inquiry , trump issued the pardon without telling the justice department , which had no comment ; politico characterizes top officials there as surprised by the move . a former obama counsel calls it " his backhand way of doing what he wanted to do at the front end , " and a " vivid demonstration of how far removed from an appropriate exercise of the pardon power this was . " republicans including arizona 's senators have condemned the pardon , and paul ryan has joined their number , reports politico , saying via a rep that he " does not agree with the decision . " as for arpaio himself , whom the post characterizes as trump 's brother in arms in birtherism , " i did n't ask for the pardon , " he says . " he wanted to do it because i think he understood what i was going through . "
