a political party in pakistan has publicly identified the top cia spy in the countryâ€”and it wants him interrogated and put on trial over a recent us drone strike , reports the guardian . the pti party , notably led by a former cricket star named imran khan , identified the islamabad station chief in a letter to police . it named him and cia chief john brennan as responsible for a drone strike earlier this month that killed civilians along with militants . wire services are not naming the station chief . pti officials say he does n't have diplomatic immunity and therefore should be tried for murder , reports ap . they also say he should be interrogated to provide the names of the drone pilots who controlled the plane from afar . assuming the identity is correct , it would be the second time in three years that those opposed to drone strikes in the country have identified a station chief . the first one had to leave the country in 2010 .
