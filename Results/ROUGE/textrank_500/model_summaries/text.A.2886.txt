they 're calling it " the most cambridge thing ever " : graffiti—written in latin—scrawled across multiple million-dollar homes in the famed uk college town . the press association reports the graffiti , which reads " locus in domos loci populum , " appeared tuesday morning . the words were written on new luxury homes that are selling for more than $ 1.5 million each , according to the bbc . the homes replaced a pub , and locals believe the graffiti is likely a protest against skyrocketing home prices and the displacement of locals in a city where the average home price is more than 10 times the average salary . " we ’ ve got incredibly rich people living one street away from incredibly poor people , " one resident tells the press association . locals say a vandal scrawling graffiti in latin is something that could " only happen " in cambridge . but the reaction to the graffiti may also be cambridge-specific . for example , it 's not the graffiti the spectator takes issue with ; it 's the grammar . the blog points out the phrase " locus in domos loci populum " is complete " gibberish " and " twaddle , " likely the result of using google to poorly translate the phrase " local homes for local people . " a cambridge classics professor gives the bbc her interpretation : " this is a bit hard to translate , but i think what they 're trying to say is that a lovely place has been turned into houses . " police are investigating , or as the romans ( by way of google ) would say : vigilum quaerimus . ( these recently surfaced latin words were a more exciting find . )
