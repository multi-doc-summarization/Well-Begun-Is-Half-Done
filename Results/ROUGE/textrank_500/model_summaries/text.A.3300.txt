an absolutely amazing story out of oklahoma , where a texas 16-year-old survived a 3,500-foot fall in a skydiving mishap—and did n't even require any surgery for her injuries . mackenzie wethington , who went skydiving saturday as a birthday present from her parents , slammed into the ground , yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney , broken bones , and a broken tooth ; she 's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she 's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects . " i have no idea how she survived , " one tells today . experts are calling it a miracle ; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words , she was incredibly lucky . the teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver , but was told when she arrived that pegasus air sports center was n't doing tandem jumps , so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry . it 's not clear exactly what happened : according to myfox dfw , the family says mackenzie 's primary parachute did n't open properly ( it was supposed to open automatically ) and may have gotten tangled , and mackenzie could n't open the emergency chute . mackenzie 's dad ( who says the main chute only half-opened , according to cnn ) blames pegasus air sports center , claiming it offered inadequate training and did n't properly maintain its equipment . the owner of pegasus , however , blames mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment : " she did n't do what she was supposed to do , " he says , though it 's not clear what she did wrong ; the owner says she did n't take a " corrective counter action " to make her parachute " stop turning . " he claims the chute did open fully but somehow , " maybe ... initiated by her , " started a rotation that caused the problem . the family has hired a lawyer , fox news insider reports .
