that infamous privacy button that matt lauer had under his desk was an “ executive perk ” rather than a “ nefarious thing ” used to trap women in his office , katie couric told wendy williams on williams ' show tuesday . “ a lot of nbc executives have those buttons that open and close doors . it was really just a privacy thing , ” couric said , per page six . " a lot of stuff gets misreported and blown out of proportion . " lauer 's former longtime colleague is struggling to reconcile her own experiences with the disgraced nbc host and what others have said about him . couric said that lauer always treated her " respectfully and appropriately , " but added that it would likely be " challenging " for lauer to experience a comeback . “ i think it depends on ... how he decides to handle what has happened . and the full extent of what has happened , i don ’ t think has been truly revealed , " she added . later tuesday , she went on bravo 's watch what happens live and cleared up another misunderstanding related to lauer . for the record , she was joking when she told the show in 2012 that lauer " pinches me on the ass a lot . " " i was joking ! it was a total joke , " she told host andy cohen .
