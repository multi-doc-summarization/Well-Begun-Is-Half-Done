orrin hatch is taking grief for his choice of words in describing the testimony of christine blasey ford on thursday . during the lunch break , the republican member of the senate judiciary committee referred to ford as an " attractive " and " pleasing " witness , reports roll call . " i do n't think she 's uncredible , " hatch told reporters . " i think she 's an attractive , good witness . " when cnn pressed him on what he meant by " attractive , " hatch responded , " in other words , she 's pleasing . " the remarks have prompted criticism , and usa today rounds up examples , including one tweet that pretty much summarizes the negative sentiment : " i can ’ t believe it seemed appropriate to orrin hatch to comment on the attractiveness of a woman testifying about her sexual assault . " but hatch 's spokesperson has an explanation : “ hatch uses ‘ attractive ’ to describe personalities , not appearances , ” he said . “ if you search his past quotes you ’ ll see he ’ s used it consistently for years for men and women he believed has compelling personalities . ”
