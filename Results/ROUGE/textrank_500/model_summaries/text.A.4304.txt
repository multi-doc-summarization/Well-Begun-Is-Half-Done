a british general is warning his country and the west about russiaâ€”a threat he calls worse than anything posed by isis or al-qaeda , the bbc reports . " the russians seek to exploit vulnerability and weakness wherever they detect it , " general mark carleton-smith tells the telegraph . " russia today indisputably represents a far greater threat to our national security than islamic extremist threats such as al-qaeda and [ isis ] . " carleton-smith , who led britain 's fight against isis and in june became head of the british army , says military action has weakened islamic militants . but in the wake of alleged poisoning and cyber-attacks , russia looms large . " russia has embarked on a systematic effort to explore and exploit western vulnerabilities , particularly in some of the non-traditional areas of cyber , space , undersea warfare , " he says . but he opposes any notion ( perhaps like french president emmanuel macron 's ) that would weaken the military strength of nato . he says the " center of gravity of european security " should hold fast . " in my experience , we should reinforce success . " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov derided carleton-smith 's remarks while visiting lisbon , radio free europe reports . " we can not influence the british government 's decisions as to whom they trust to head its armed forces , " says lavrov . " i hope they check the appropriateness of such decisions . " ( russian trolls apparently whipped up a frenzy over vaccines . )
