both taylor swift and katy perry have had difficult breakups with john mayer , but swift insists the story behind a vitriolic song on her upcoming 1989 album " was n't even about a guy ! it had to do with business , " she says in an interview with rolling stone . technically , " bad blood " might not even be about katy perry—swift demurred from naming names when talking about the song—but by piecing together lyrical and situational clues , buzzfeed claims " it 's not hard to figure out who she 's talking about . " the song , which swift tells rolling stone was n't meant " to create some gossip-fest , " talks about a fellow female performing artist who for years insulted and sabotaged swift , including by " [ trying ] to hire a bunch of people out from under me " and " sabotage an entire arena tour , " swift says . buzzfeed speculates she could be talking about three backup dancers who reportedly ditched swift for perry last year—and e ! notes that perry tweeted today , " watch out for the regina george in sheep 's clothing ... , " a mean girls reference that could be a hint that perry is indeed the song 's subject . " for years , i was never sure if we were friends or not , " swift says in rolling stone of her unnamed colleague . " [ then ] she did something so horrible . i was like , 'oh , we 're just straight-up enemies . ' " as for why she wrote the song , swift says , " i 'm surprisingly non-confrontational—you would not believe how much i hate conflict . so now i have to avoid her . it 's awkward . " but , she adds , " sometimes the lines in a song are lines you wish you could text-message somebody in real life . i would just be constantly writing all these zingers—like , 'burn . that would really get her . ' " the album is due out in october .
