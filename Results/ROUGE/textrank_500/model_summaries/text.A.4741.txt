see if this sounds familiar : a nation reeling from a major terror attack puts into place sweeping new surveillance rules in the name of public safety that critics think violate civil liberties . a measure with the nickname the " french patriot act " cleared the lower house of parliament in france today , reports france24 . the legislation now goes to the senate , where it seems likely to pass , reports the new york times , which provides some specifics : the provisions would let intelligence services " tap cellphones , read emails and force internet providers to comply with government requests to sift through virtually all of their subscribers â€™ communications . " advocates insist the monitoring would be directed at suspected terrorists , but critics do n't buy it . a nine-person committee set up to oversee the surveillance would have only an advisory role and could not overrule the prime minister . the measure " shows a number of tactics that seem cribbed from the nsa , including bulk collection of internet metadata , which would allow the government to track french citizens from site to site , " notes a post at the verge . the legislation also allows intelligence services to put microphones in a room or on objects to record conversations , and to use other devices to intercept phone conversations and text messages . the french debate follows the attacks on the charlie hebdo offices , and " many in the socialist party who would normally have spoken out against the new powers have instead kept quiet , " observes the bbc . " in the wake of the january attacks , there is little political mileage in raising doubts about the intelligence services . " ( in the us , things seem to be moving in the opposite direction . )
