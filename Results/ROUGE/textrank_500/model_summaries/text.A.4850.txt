what should have been a joyful trip turned tragic early friday , when a central wisconsin man died while driving his pregnant wife to the hospital to deliver their eighth child . michael rogan , 42 , was driving a van with his wife and seven children aboard when another car hit a deer , sending the animal into the van 's windshield . wife niki was able to steer the van into a shallow ditch , the ap reports . rogan died of his injuries later at a marathon county hospital ; everyone else received only minor injuries , and niki gave birth to a son named blaise that afternoon—the new baby was baptized , as planned , sunday at the family 's church , the wausau daily herald reports . a friend explains to wsaw that she does n't think niki has ever missed a mass due to a child 's birth : " she wanted to go . " " it was a very teary morning , " says the reverend , who notes that about 100 people came together at a nearby home after the baptism . faith was important to rogan , and the former marine could typically be found at st. mary 's oratory in wausau , which he had attended for at least 15 years , about three times a week , the reverend says . friends have stepped forward to help with rogan 's organic seed and fertilizer business , and a gofundme campaign has so far raised more than $ 270,000 for the family he left behind . niki is a stay-at-home mom and homeschools the kids—who , besides the newborn , range in age from 2 to 15—and the money raised will be used to allow her to continue to do that as well as cover the costs of a new van , medical expenses , and the funeral this weekend .
