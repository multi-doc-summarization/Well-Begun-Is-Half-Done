" " i do everything to make u happy and to not say anything to rock the boat with u . you do everything to throw tantrums in front of people . " " i 'm sorry you think i was hitting on my friend 's husband and u think so little of me . i just want to be loved and to love . right now i am very unhappy and sad " " i ca n't be attacked by outsiders for dating you and then be attacked by you..the one person i need protection from . " pistorius : " i was standing tight behind me watching you touch his arm . but when i left , u just kept on chatting to him . i 'm sorry i asked u to stop touching my neck . " pistorious admitted he is " tired and sick " but that does n't excuse his jealous behavior . apparently in reference to a shooting incident , he wrote " angel , please do n't say a thing to any one , darren told everyone it was his fault . i ca n't afford for that to come out . the guys promised not to say a thing .
