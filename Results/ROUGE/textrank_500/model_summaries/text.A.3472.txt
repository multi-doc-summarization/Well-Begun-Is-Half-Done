ever since deborah skouson came home with a pink flowered shirt for her daughter five years ago , cami , who has autism , has been " fixated " on it . it quickly became her favorite piece of clothing , leading skouson to scour ebay each time her daughter 's current shirt became unwearable . but the fifth time she sought a replacement , ebay 's stock had run dry . that 's when the utah mom turned to facebook , asking friends to share her request for the shirt along with her offer to pay whatever it cost , plus shipping . " it has to be this exact shirt ! " skouson wrote on aug. 7 . " we 've tried similar shirts , and they do n't cut it with cami ! " as of thursday , no less than 150 matching shirts have arrived at her door from as far away as germany , reports the daily dot . " at first , my daughter was a little confused to see more than one of her 'pink flower shirts . ' i explained to her that people gave them to her because they loved her , " says skouson , a special education teacher , noting people have offered to make teddy bears , pillows , and blankets for her 10-year-old out of any extra shirts . she adds she tearfully accepted an offer from target—which sells the circo-brand item and heard about the story—to make larger versions of the shirt so cami can wear it even when she 's an adult . " it 's been very , very touching , " skouson tells kutv . " these are all total strangers , " she wrote on facebook . " people are inherently good and kind , and i 'm glad i 've been able to be a recipient of that kindness . " ( a photo of a cake decorated by someone with autism also went viral . )
