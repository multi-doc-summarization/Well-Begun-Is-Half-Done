it 's election day in israel , but there 's not a lot of intrigue : prime minister benjamin netanyahu is almost certain to win another term , although his ticket ( a joint ticket combining his conservative likud party with the ultranationalist yisrael beiteinu ) could lose as many as 10 of the seats it currently holds in parliament , perhaps to jewish home , a party that is further to the right . despite the foregone conclusion , ynetnews reports that the country is seeing its highest voter turnout since 1999 , and the election could end up breaking voting records in israel . the new york times reports that voter participation had previously been dropping steadily , perhaps due to voter fatigue ( israel held five general elections , plus a direct ballot for prime minister , between 1992 and 2009 ) ; it was at less than 65 % in 2009 . this year , the central elections committee ran a rousing voter drive , and president shimon peres urged everyone to vote . the jerusalem post notes that us media do n't seem to care about the israeli vote , perhaps because it falls on the day after president obama 's second inauguration . most us coverage has focused on the less-than-exciting nature of the race and the lack of debate in israel on some topicsâ€”for example , netanyahu 's failure to produce a formal platform .
