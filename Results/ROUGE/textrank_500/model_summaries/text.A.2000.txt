it 's long been known that the predecessors of modern humans and neanderthals lived side by side , but it was n't until 2010 that it was discovered the two species interbred . in fact , as much as 4 % of the dna of modern humans with european or asian ancestry comes from neanderthals , reports the guardian . that intermingling is bound to have consequences , but researchers who 've been looking for them were surprised to find a dozen traits specifically linked to neanderthal genetic variantsâ€”including risk for nicotine addiction , artery thickening , heart attack , and depression . researchers arrived at their conclusions , published in the journal science , after cross-referencing neanderthal dna with a database of 28,000 people of european ancestry that pulls together biological samples and electronic health records . " the brain is incredibly complex , so it 's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences , " lead author corinne simonti says in a vanderbilt news statement . case in point : the researchers found neanderthal dna increases blood clotting , which would have helped seal wounds more speedily ; but for modern man , hypercoagulation ups the risk of miscarriage , stroke , and more , reports live science . oh , and the popular idea that neanderthal dna influences skin tone is probably bunk , the researchers add , noting skin color differences likely emerged much more recently . ( sex with neanderthals may also explain modern allergies . )
