now that perez hilton 's days of tweeting upskirt photos of underage celebs are apparently over , he 's totally ready to be a dad . the acerbic gossip blogger posted a note to fans on his website yesterday announcing that his first child , " a beautiful and healthy baby boy , " was born earlier this month . he also said he 's looking forward to " guiding " his " little man " through life ( and , we guess , reading him a children 's book penned by none other than perez hilton ) . no word on how this all came about , although the la times notes that hilton has discussed surrogacy in the past .
