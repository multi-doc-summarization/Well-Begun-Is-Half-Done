under a pending merger , vca animal hospitals will come under the ownership of mars , inc. not only is it a bit strange for a chain of veterinary care facilities to be owned by a candy and packaged foods company—it 's more than a bit concerning for pet owners , the consumerist reports . mars already bought the banfield pet hospital chain back in 2007 , and big problems have been reported with those veterinary offices , which are connected to petsmart stores . most troubling is banfield 's practice of selling pet owners pricey " pet wellness plans , " which sound like pet health insurance but are n't . owners are charged a monthly fee in exchange for receiving discounts on veterinary services , and are often told by banfield representatives that they can cancel at any time after the first year without incurring a fee . the problem ? that 's not exactly true . once the plan renews , members are on the hook for another full year of monthly payments—or , yes , a fee if they cancel , as one angry plan owner once explained to the consumerist . other pet owners have been distressed to learn that , should their pet die mid-plan year , they 're also still on the hook for the rest of that year 's monthly payments . there 's also the fact that , as bloomberg businessweek recently revealed , those same wellness plans include services that not all animals need—and even some that could put them at risk , like annual teeth cleanings under general anesthesia . mars will be adding 800 vca hospitals to its 900 or so banfield locations , and will also be merging with another large veterinary chain , bluepearl veterinary partners , meaning a huge number of veterinary facilities could soon be adopting similar practices . as for why mars is getting into the vet care industry ? it 's becoming a huge moneymaker , with pet owners willing to put out big bucks for their animals .
