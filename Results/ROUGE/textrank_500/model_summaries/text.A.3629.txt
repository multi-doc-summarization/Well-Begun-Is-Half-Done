bloom energy 's plans to put a zero-emission energy server into mass production is an " exciting development , " writes david coursey , but the company has loads of work to do before the so-called bloom box becomes the game-changer the hype suggests . the company is promising miniature $ 3,000 servers will be on the market in 10 years to power homes , but that 's a long way from the big $ 800,000 device it 's currently pitching to companies . the company did n't offer many details on how it will get there , notes ap , and plenty of other companies are at work on the same concept . one fuel cell expert tells national geographic he 's " pretty pissed " at the lack of explanation and dismissed it as " all hype . " coursey is more hopeful at pcworld . " who can really say ? if i were guessing , i 'd imagine bloom servers might appear to power whole neighborhoods and be operated by traditional power companies before the home server appears . it all depends on how the technology and market place develops over time .
