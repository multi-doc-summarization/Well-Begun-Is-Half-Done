no one used to pay much mind to the giraffes that roamed africa . but new numbers from the international union for the conservation of nature show a significant decline in their population over the past three decades and have conservationists worried that the elegant creature is falling victim to what one iucn expert calls a " silent extinction , " the bbc reports . in 1985 , there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes , but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015â€”a " devastating decline " of nearly 40 % that now moves the animal from the " least concern " category into the " vulnerable " one on the group 's red list . " while there [ has ] been great concern about elephants and rhinos , giraffes have gone under the radar , " says dr. fennessy , co-director of the iucn 's giraffe conservation arm . the updated red list , released thursday at a biological diversity conference in cancun , mexico , points to man as the main driver of the declining stats , with poaching , habitat loss , and local unrest all assuming partial blame . a duke university conservation biologist says the iucn is partly to blame , too , for not considering more species threatened . " there 's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [ such as giraffes , chimps , etc . ] must be ok because ... we see them in zoos , " he tells the ap . " this is dangerous . " some good news , at least for some long-neckers : of the nine giraffe subspecies , three of them are experiencing increasing populations ; one is stable . a resolution passed in september at the iucn 's world conservation congress hopes to reverse the falling numbers of " africa 's iconic megafauna . " ( three rare giraffes were killed for their tails . )
