" that 's exactly what data journalist walt hickey did for fivethirtyeight.com , picking through the prognostications ( 676 unique ones among his 1,035-cookie sample ) , the " lucky numbers " included on each slip of paper , and even the mandarin vocab printed on the reverse sides . despite his inventory being 15 cookies short of what he ordered ( did anyone really think someone in love with data would n't count every single cookie ? ) , he made some fascinating and surprising finds . here , a sample : those lucky numbers are n't not lucky . hickey calls this discovery " weird as hell , " but he admits that , after comparing the numbers on the fortunes to winning powerball numbers over a nearly 20-year stretch , the value of playing the fortunes ' numbers over that time period would have left a hypothetic gambler with a slight profit ( just under $ 175 ) , while playing random numbers would leave that same gambler with a $ 2,540 deficit . he 's got some common-sense explanations for why that may be . what do the fortunes really tell us ? they do n't so much tell our fortunes as appeal to our egos and sense of good citizenship , apparently . only 22.3 % of the themes enclosed within the cookies actually dabbled in prophesy : the vast majority ( 52.9 % ) included the word " you " and spit out praise or criticism of one 's strengths and weaknesses , while others included basic life advice and well-worn wisdom like " do onto others as you wish others do onto you . " hickey even built his own online bot to see what randomly generated fortunes it would churn out . check it out here . break open the steamed dumplings and read more on what the fivethirtyeight analysis turned up .
