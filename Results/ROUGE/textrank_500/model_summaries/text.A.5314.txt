one of yesterday 's april fools ' day pranks apparently fooled a few too many people : a forbes contributor posted a blog on forbes.com claiming that mitt romney had dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed rick santorum . despite the fact that editors took it down after just half an hour , the news quickly went viral on twitter and was , for a short time , the no . 1 story on google news . the uproar is " kind of baffling , " contributor len burman tells the washington post . " it was april fools â€™ day , and it was completely implausible . nobody in the party would have said those things . " among burman 's " implausible " quotes from the original blog : romney claiming he has " no chance " to win the general election and saying that republicans should " get our butts kicked now and move on . " the entire post is available on burman 's personal blog . meanwhile , romney also found himself the butt of an april fools ' day prank dreamed up by his aides , the post notes . paul ryan introduced romney , set to give a stump speech at a milwaukee pancake breakfast yesterday , but when the candidate emerged he was faced with an empty room . " i thought , 'oh , boy , this is gon na look really bad on the evening news , let me tell you , ' " says romney , who had forgotten the date . after hearing cries of " april fools " he laughed it off and was taken to the real room , where several hundred supporters were gathered . the whole thing was caught on video , of course .
