about six years ago , scientists discovered a huge ring around saturn that also happened to be invisible to the naked eye . now , they 've learned that it 's much bigger than they thought , and their theory on how it came to be might change some thinking about planetary rings and moons . scientists previously estimated the ring to be about 200 times the radius of saturn , but now they say it 's 30 % larger , or about 270 times the radius , they write in nature . it stretches more than 10 million miles , which a post at phys.org puts into perspective : " if saturn were merely the size of a basketball , this new outer ring would extend nearly two thirds the length of a football field away from it . " or as lead author douglas hamilton puts it in the los angeles times : “ it is 10 to 20 times larger than the second-biggest ring , so this thing is absolutely gargantuan. ” researchers also found that the ring is made of up surprisingly small particles , with only about 10 % of them larger than a soccer ball . they suspect the material , which is quite spread out within the ring , comes from the saturn moon phoebe , but it was previously believed that debris ejected at such a distance would form a moon rather than a ring . " now it appears such theories will have to be rethought , " says the phys.org post . the ring can be detected only in infrared wavelengths . based on all this , it 's possible that jupiter , uranus , and neptune have similar rings , reports wired . “ maybe ring isn ’ t even the right word anymore , " says hamilton , " maybe we should call them clouds . those are much harder to detect and convince yourself that they ’ re real. ” ( another of saturn 's moons might be able to support life . )
