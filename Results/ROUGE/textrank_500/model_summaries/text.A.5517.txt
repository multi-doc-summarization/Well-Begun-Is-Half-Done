for four years , nearly all kids living in japan 's fukushima prefecture have received ultrasounds to gauge the effects of the nuclear disaster there in march 2011 . now a research team says the alarming results are in : children living near the nuclear plant have thyroid cancer rates that are 20 to 50 times higher than those found in children elsewhere , the ap reports . per a study being published in the november issue of epidemiology , of the 370,000 or so kids 18 and under in the fukushima region who received thyroid exams since the disaster , 137 of them have suspected or confirmed cases of thyroid cancer , a number that rose by 25 from last year , the ap notes . " this is more than expected and emerging faster than expected , " lead author toshihide tsuda tells the ap . thyroid cancer cases in children outside the prefecture are estimated to be around one or two out of every million kids per year . children 's thyroids are particularly vulnerable to cancer—radioactive iodine released during nuclear meltdowns can cause it—because they 're growing so quickly , npr notes . tsuda and his team claim that the numbers are n't simply the result of a " screening effect " —in which more routine checkups like the ones in fukushima have simply found tumors earlier and more often—as the japanese government has suggested . other experts , however , are n't so sure how accurate tsuda 's study is and note the complexity of studying such an issue . the director for columbia university 's center for radiological research , for example , tells npr that just tying certain geographic areas to higher cancer rates does n't prove anything without looking at individual radiation exposure , a claim that 's echoed in a report by the world health organization . ( the residents of the japanese town of nahara are finally allowed back—but many do n't want to go . )
