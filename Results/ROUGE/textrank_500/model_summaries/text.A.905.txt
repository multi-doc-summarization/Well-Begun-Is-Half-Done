leonardo dicaprio almost played anakin skywalker in the star wars prequels , he revealed in a recent shortlist interview . " i did have a meeting with george lucas about that , " he says , but he did n't want the role : " just didn ’ t feel ready to take that dive . at that point . " it 's the same reason , he explains , that he met with joel schumacher about playing robin in batman forever but did n't actually take the part . " as i recall , i took the meeting , but didn ’ t want to play the role , " he says . " joel schumacher is a very talented director but i don ’ t think i was ready for anything like that . " and the same thing happened again with spider-man , a role tobey maguire eventually took : " that was another one of those situations , similar to robin , where i didn ’ t feel ready to put on that suit yet . they got in touch with me . " in other revealing , star wars-related interviews , george lucas let slip in a recent interview with charlie rose what he really thinks about the new movies , business insider reports . he sold lucasfilm to disney in 2012 partially because there were three more star wars movies he felt should be made , and " to do it right would be 10 years , and i said , ' i 'm 70—i do n't know whether i 'll be here when i 'm 80 ' ... and i want to do [ other films ] , so i have to make the decision on my own that it 's time for me to move on . " he did have ideas for episodes vii , viii , and ix—but disney " looked at the stories and they said , 'we want to make something for the fans . ' i said , 'all i want to do is tell a story . ' ... they decided they didn ’ t want to use those [ my ] stories , they decided they were going to do their own thing . they weren ’ t that keen to have me involved anyway . " he also added , offhandedly , that he sold the franchise " to the white slavers . " he 's since apologized for that .
