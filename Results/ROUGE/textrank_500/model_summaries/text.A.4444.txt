virginia 's attorney general learned all about the dangers of twitter yesterday , when he sent out a tweet that made at least one writer think he wanted to " service bin laden , sexually , in the great beyond . " the offending tweet from ken cuccinelli : " how much would i give to be one of the 72 virginans osama is 'hanging out ' with since sunday ? " of course , some assumed he meant " virgins , " which led to quite an uproar , reports the virginian-pilot . " is cuccinelli a virgin , or was he—perhaps more disturbingly—shooting for 'virginians ' with this tweet ? " wondered jason linkins on the huffington post . turns out cuccinelli was , in fact , aiming for " virginians , " in reference to a joke that went around the internet recently . ( think bin laden being greeted after death by 72 such names as george washington and thomas jefferson , rather than the virgins he expected—read the entire joke here . ) cuccinelli quickly clarified his tweet , and even spelled virginians correctly the second time around—but apparently did n't pick up on his initial typo .
