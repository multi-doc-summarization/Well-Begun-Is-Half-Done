during an appearance on megyn kelly today wednesday , former scientologist brendan tighe said that scarlett johansson once auditioned to be tom cruise 's girlfriend . johansson was having none of it , quickly hitting back with a statement to e ! news . " the very idea of any person auditioning to be in a relationship is so demeaning , " it reads . " i refuse for anyone to spread the idea that i lack the integrity to choose my own relationships . only a man aka brendan tighe would come up with a crazy story like that . " in his interview with kelly , tighe claimed to have learned of the audition when reports from cruise 's handler were accidentally printed on tighe 's printer . the report said " it did n't go well , " tighe said of the audition , adding that another actress , scientologist erika christensen , had to " disconnect " from johansson as a result of it not going well . " because scarlett was n't interested ? " kelly said . " correct , " tighe said . the church of scientology also disputed tighe 's claims . as for cruise , he 's also in the tabloids due to a report that he 's trying to make plans to see suri , his daughter with katie holmes . gossip cop says those reports are false , though the site does note cruise has n't seen suri , 12 , in several years .
