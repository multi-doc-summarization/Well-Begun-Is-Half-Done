who better to offer advice to the lovelorn , the beleaguered , and the downtrodden than a hermit-like japanese novelist ? that 's the plan for haruki murakami , known recluse and one of japan 's most famous writers , his publisher said today , per the guardian . according to shinchosha publishing , the 65-year-old surrealist author will serve as what the brits call an " agony uncle " on a page called " murakami 's place " on its website , dispensing wisdom in response to questions submitted by readers from jan. 15 through jan. 31 , reuters reports . he 'll tackle " questions of any kind , " a company rep says per the guardian . " after so long , i want to exchange emails with readers , " murakami is quoted as saying by shinchosha , with the rep adding to reuters that " he likes to engage with readers , but there 's so much interest it 's hard for him to interact well . this should be smoother . " marukami once referred to himself as " an endangered species [ that ] may get intimidated and bite " if people got too close to him , the new statesman reported in 2013 . no one 's sure where the self-banished murakami—often brought up as a possible nobel prize candidate—lives , though the guardian notes he " spends much of his time " in the us ; the new statesman claims he resides in both japan and hawaii . some of the qs he may receive will likely touch on some of his favorite topics , including cats and the yakult swallows , a pro japanese baseball team . or they may be more fitting for a writer known for what the guardian calls " intricately-crafted tales of the absurdity and loneliness of modern life " : " we expect there to be some rather strange questions , " the rep says , per reuters . " which ones he answers depends on him . " ( hopefully it will turn out better than this lad-mag column . )
