the " atlantification " of the arctic ocean is underway . and no , that does n't mean we 're about to get the polar bear version of outkast , but rather that the arctic ocean is rapidly becoming more like the atlantic ocean , according to new research published thursday . the arctic ocean has historically been separated into two layers : a cold , less salty layer on top with a salty , warmer layer of atlantic water underneath , scientific american reports . the barrier between the two is called the cold halocline layer , and it 's been responsible for preserving arctic sea ice , according to science . but the separation between the layers has been quickly breaking down over the past decade or so . the temperature difference between the two layers has lessened by 2 degrees since 2002 , and the top layer of cold water has gotten thinner in the past decadeâ€”possibly by as much as 180 feet . from 2013 to 2015 , the layers merged completely in some areas . the loss of the cold halocline layer means sea ice in the arctic is getting attacked from both sides . warming air and warming surface ocean temperatures are creating a " positive feedback loop " that is decimating the ice . sea ice in the arctic is decreasing by 13 % every decade , and soon the arctic ocean could be entirely ice-free during the summer . between warmer water with more nutrients and no more ice to block the sun , it 's unclear what will happen to the arctic 's ecosystem , inverse reports .
