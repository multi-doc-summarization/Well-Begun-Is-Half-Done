cell phones in theaters : after two high-profile incidents on broadway , things seem to have reached a " tipping point , " observes variety . the first occurred when 19-year-old nick silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of hand to god and plugged his phone into an outlet , not realizing it was a prop . he tells playbill that it was n't a joke and that he was n't acting on a dare . he just needed to charge his iphone . " i saw the outlet and ran for it , " he recalls . " that was the only outlet i saw , so i thought , 'why not ? ' i was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set , and i figured it would n't be a big deal if my phone was up there too . " security guards quickly moved in . after talking to playbill , silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized . " i do n't go to plays very much , and i did n't realize that the stage is considered off limits , " he said , per gothamist . ( variety notes that hand to god , which has been struggling to sell tickets , was happy to capitalize by organizing that press conference . ) the second incident occurred when patti lupone took the phone from an audience member who was texting during show for days . given that she remained in character the whole time , the new york post grants her a " standing ovation . " vanity fair rounds up previous incidents , saying they " offer proof that , even if our movie theaters are slowly succumbing to the inevitability of omnipresent cell phones , the theater community may well choose to die on this hill . " plus , broadway actors have a big advantage over movie actors : " the ability to fight back . "
