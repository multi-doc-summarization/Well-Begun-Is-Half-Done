after four decades of work , researchers published the origin of big bird ( not that one ) in science this week—and it 's scientifically unprecedented . the bbc reports that for the first time ever , researchers were able to watch the rise of a new species play out in nature . " it 's an extreme case of something we 're coming to realize , " a speciation expert says . " evolution in general can happen very quickly . " according to a press release , in 1981 an interloper arrived on daphne major , a tiny island in the galapagos archipelago where peter and b. rosemary grant were studying darwin 's finches . the new bird , bigger than the three species living on the island , was a large cactus finch that had apparently flown from an island more than 60 miles away . unable to return , it mated with a local medium ground finch . the resulting offspring , nicknamed the big bird lineage for their size , were unable to attract partners from the local finch population due to their weird song and unusual beak size and mated only among themselves . b. rosemary grant calls it a " terrifically inbred lineage , " science alert reports . within just two generations , the big birds were a distinct species , as confirmed by genomic sequencing and their own unique physical characteristics . an expert says if a naturalist came to the island today , they would simply believe there were four native finch species with nothing giving away the big bird as a recent addition . it was touch-and-go there for a minute—droughts in 2002 and 2003 killed all but two big birds—but there are now 30 or so members of the hybrid species living on daphne major . ( the savior of the galapagos tortoise is a dirty , dirty old man . )
