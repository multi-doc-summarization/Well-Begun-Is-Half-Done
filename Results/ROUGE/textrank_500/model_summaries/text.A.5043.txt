" i am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter , as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public , " fbi director christopher wray says . he adds that the fbi has spoken with survivors and victims ' families and " deeply [ regrets ] the additional pain this causes .
