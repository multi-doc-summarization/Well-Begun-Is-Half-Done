more than two years after she was declared brain dead , jahi mcmath is as " healthy and beautiful as ever " and is " proving naysayers wrong , " according to family members . in a march 15 facebook post on the " keep jahi mcmath on life support " page , family members shared a recent photo of the girl , who is now 15 , nj.com reports . the post continued , per nj.com , " a fighter , a warrior , a blessed child , gods got your back little girl , keep fighting . your testimony will be a great one . " the post is no longer publicly accessible ( the facebook link returns the line : " the link you followed may have expired , or the page may only be visible to an audience you 're not in " ) , and a fresh post to the page made late sunday night asks anyone " here to spew your negative thoughts " to " remove yourself . " the former oakland , calif. , resident , who went into cardiac arrest after routine tonsil surgery in late 2013 , has been on life support at a facility in new jersey since early 2014 . mcmath 's family—who moved to new jersey because the state accommodates people who object to brain death declarations on religious grounds—has been seeking to have her death certificate revoked . declaring her alive would allow them to move back to california , where she is considered legally dead , and would require insurance companies to cover the cost of her care . fox 29 reports that in an earlier facebook update , jahi 's mother , nailah winkfield , thanked those who shared their opinions about the case , even negative ones . " hopefully my daughter can change some of the ways brain death is viewed in today 's society , " she wrote . " honestly , i think she already has . "
