the jackie robinson biopic 42 slides into theaters today , and it 's being greeted by a polite ovation from critics , who for the most part seem to admire robinson 's story more than the filmmaking . here 's what people are saying : if director brian helgeland 's " intention was to tell jackie 's story in a linear , paint-by-numbers fashion , he has achieved that goal , " writes james berardinelli at reelviews . " the film takes no chances and does nothing bold . " still , he gives it a decent score , saying it 's " a worthwhile sports movie " that " evokes powerful emotions " thanks to its compelling story . ao scott at the new york times has a more charitable take , writing that helgeland " has honorably sacrificed the chance to make a great movie in the interest of making one that is accessible and inspiring . " the film is pure hero-worship . " it is blunt , simple , and sentimental , using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson . " in the process , it gives younger viewers an unflinching look at the ugly " world their grandparents were born into . " " chadwick boseman is perfect as robinson , " gushes stephen whitty at the star-ledger . " he captures , in a clenched jaw or a sidelong glance , a lifetime 's worth of dearly attained dignity . " harrison ford , meanwhile , might get a supporting actor nod ; " it is the first time in years i have seen ford have fun onscreen . " sure , the movie is " thick with hollywood cliches â€¦ but that does n't mean it wo n't make you feel good . " wesley morris at grantland complains that the movie is a little too reverential . robinson does n't have to change , " white america does . that 's great for messaging , but hell on drama . " it 's the white characters who evolve , not the saint wearing 42 . " having an actor play robinson makes sense for realism , but most of the time a piece of cardboard with robinson 's likeness would have done the trick . "
