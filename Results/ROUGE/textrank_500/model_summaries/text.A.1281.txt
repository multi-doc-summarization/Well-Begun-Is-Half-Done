" many in legacy media love mass shootings , " nbc news quotes nra spokesperson dana loesch as saying thursday at the conservative political action conference . " you love the ratings . crying white mothers are ratings gold . " a week after 17 people were killed at a school shooting in florida , the nra went on the defensive in speeches , videos , and statements targeting gun-control advocates , democrats , the media , and even some ideas put forth by president trump , the washington post reports . in his own speech at cpac , nra ceo wayne lapierre warned citizens to be " frightened " of any democratic election victory . " what they want is more restrictions on the law-abiding , " cnn quotes lapierre as saying . " if they seize power ... our american freedoms could be lost and our country will be changed forever . " following in trump 's footsteps , lapierre called for more armed security in schools , including arming teachers . " evil walks among us , " he said , adding , " god help us if we don â€™ t harden our schools . " however , the president has also suggested increasing the age to purchase semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21 in opposition to the nra . an nra spokesperson says such a law would deprive young people " of their constitutional right to self-protection . " lapierre spent most of his time at cpac railing against what he says is a " socialist " agenda pushed by democrats in the wake of the parkland shooting . " opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain , " he said . democratic sen. chuck schumer responded : " the nra is once again spewing pathetic , out of touch ideas , blaming everything but guns .
