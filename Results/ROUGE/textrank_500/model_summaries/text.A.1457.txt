writer salman rushdie was furious at " moronic " facebook yesterday after the network took down his profile because operators thought it was fake . to start it up again , he was ordered to send in a copy of his passport—then told to use the name ahmed because that 's what appears on his passport . " they insist i call myself by the first name i have never used , " he complained . " what a bunch of morons . " real first names are required by facebook policy , even if you 've used your middle name your entire life . “ dear # facebook , ” he tweeted , “ forcing me to change my fb name from salman to ahmed rushdie is like forcing j. edgar to become john hoover. ” after much writerly moaning and groaning by the author of satanic verses , the profile page was reinstated with the name salman rushdie . facebook said the takedown was all a misunderstanding and apologized . " victory . salman returns , " crowed ahmed .
