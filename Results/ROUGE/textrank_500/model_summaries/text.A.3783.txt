is the era of sugary sports drinks coming to an end ? gatorade is launching its new gatorade zero this week , a sports drink with no sugar and no carbohydrates . gatorade has long dominated the sports drink industry , but as health-conscious consumers have begun eschewing sugar , some have soured on the drink—which has 34 grams of sugar per 20 ounces—sending sales down 0.5 % last year , cnnmoney reports . gatorade has previously tried an organic version and a low-calorie version with less sugar . gatorade zero , which will be known as g zero , per bloomberg , will compete directly with powerade zero , a sugar-free sports drink that entered the market 10 years ago .
