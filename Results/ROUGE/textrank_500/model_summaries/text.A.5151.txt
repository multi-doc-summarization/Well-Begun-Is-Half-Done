" any guy that can do a body-slam , he 's my guy , " president trump shouted to a cheering montana audience thursday night as he simulated slamming someone to the ground , then noting , " i should n't say that . " trump was discussing rep. greg gianforte , who assaulted guardian reporter ben jacobs last year during the special election for the house seat vacated by ryan zinke , a misdemeanor assault to which he pleaded guilty and completed community service and an anger management class . trump said after the incident , he feared gianforte had blown his chance at the congressional seat . " i said , 'oh , this is terrible , he 's gon na lose the election , ' " trump recounted . " then i said , 'well , wait a minuteâ€”i know montana pretty well . i think it might help him . ' and it did . " trump was in big sky country stumping for matt rosendale in his race for democrat jon tester 's senate seat . reaction came quickly : john mulholland , us editor of the guardian , put out a statement after the rally blasting trump 's words as " an attack on the first amendment , " asking for an apology and adding , " in the aftermath of the murder of jamal khashoggi , it runs the risk of inviting other assaults on journalists both here and across the world . " abc news reports on what the toronto star 's daniel dale calls the " most significant " and " truly horrible " moment in the rally : " the president is gleefully applauding violence against a journalist . " trump also praised gianforte as " smart " and then advised the crowd to " never wrestle him . " ( trump seems to acknowledge khashoggi is dead . )
