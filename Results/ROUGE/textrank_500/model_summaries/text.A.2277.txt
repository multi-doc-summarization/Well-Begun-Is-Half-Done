election results are still trickling in in washington state ( it 's a vote-by-mail-only state , komo news reports ) , but it looks like voters are giving democratic rep. roger freeman of federal way a second term with about 53 % of the vote , nbc news notes . there 's just one problem : the 48-year-old freeman died last week after a long battle with colon cancer , the seattle times reports . many voters either did n't know freeman had died or had already sent in their ballots , the washington post reports . " i did not know that . when did he pass away ? " one voter told kval . " this is extremely rare , " a spokesman for washington 's secretary of state tells nbc . " but there are protocols in place . " those protocols would be much simpler if voters had simply elected the very much alive republican candidate , jack dovey . however , since freeman is apparently the victor , democrats in the district will pick three names to serve as his temporary replacement ; the county councils will then vote one of those candidates in to serve for one year , with a special election next year to pick someone for the final year of the two-year term , nbc notes . dovey , now known as the challenger beat by a deceased candidate , simply tells kval , " it 's a tragic thing that happened . " ( this county candidate dropped out of the race after his dead friend supposedly voted for him . )
