critics agree : the visuals in ridley scott 's prometheus are stunning . as for the story—about a space crew tracking the aliens who may have created us—it 's a little too heavy for its own good . " prometheus could have been an elegant , moody sci-fi actioner if only it did n't strain so hard for weighty existential meaning , " writes dana stevens at slate . the film " is more interested in piling on big questions than in answering them . it ’ s deep without being particularly smart , " though its design and effects are so " dazzling " you wo n't realize " that basic flaw until at least an hour in . " joe morgenstern echoes stevens in the wall street journal . " this tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life , but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder , " he notes . still , it 's " worth seeing for the quality of its sci-fi sights . " in the los angeles times , kenneth turan notes that the movie " pushes too hard for significance , " which " contrasts badly with the standard nature of some of the story 's plotting . " for " its wizardly director , it 's something of a disappointment . " but at the chicago sun-times , roger ebert raves that prometheus is " a seamless blend of story , special effects , and pitch-perfect casting , filmed in sane , effective 3-d that does n't distract . " and ebert finds it " all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life and does n't have the answers . "
