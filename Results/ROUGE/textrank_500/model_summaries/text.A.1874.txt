having the president-elect as a neighbor is n't all sunshine and roses , according to tiffany , which appears to partly blame donald trump for its poor us sales over the last three months . tiffany actually saw a 1 % boost in worldwide sales to $ 949.3 million in q3—the company 's first positive in two years—thanks to a strong performance in japan and china , per reuters . but us sales fell 2 % compared to the same period last year . in explaining the figures , tiffany notes its flagship store happens to sit on the same block as trump tower , where protesters gathered both before and after the election , per the guardian . " with respect to the impact of recent election-related activity near the company 's new york flagship store , management has noted some adverse effect on traffic in that store and a continuation of sales softness relative to prior year and to the company 's other us stores this year , " the company says . in other words , protesters scared away customers from what tiffany calls " simply the most famous store there is . " however , q3 ended on oct. 31 , more than a week before the largest protests outside trump tower followed trump 's election win . with that in mind , tiffany notes such adverse effects could continue in q4 and beyond .
