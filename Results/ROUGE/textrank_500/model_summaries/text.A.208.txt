after failing to get congress—or mexico—to cough up enough cash for a wall along the mexican border , president trump has been looking into getting the pentagon to pay for it , reasoning that it has plenty of money under the new federal budget , insiders say . the sources tell the washington post that trump , worried that failure to build the promised wall will cause supporters to desert him , has been privately pushing defense secretary jim mattis , among others , to make the wall a military-funded project because of national security fears . but officials say the military is unlikely to pay for the wall , and even if the pentagon was willing , it would require an act and the move would not get 60 votes in the senate . in a tweet tuesday , trump argued that the military is " rich " and building a border wall is all about national defense because there are " enemy combatants pouring into our country . " " build wall through m ! " he urged . trump wants $ 25 billion for the wall , but the latest spending bill allocates just $ 1.6 billion , with restrictions on how it can be spent . " first mexico was supposed to pay for it , then us taxpayers , and now our men and women in uniform ? ” senate minority leader chuck schumer tells the post . " this would be a blatant misuse of military funds and tied up in court for years . " cnn reports that press secretary sarah huckabee sanders declined to comment on possible military funding tuesday . the " continuation of building the wall is ongoing , and we 're going to continue moving forward in that process , " she said .
