a romance that enchanted russia may be over : as the ap reports , timur the goat and amur the tiger have had a fight and are n't together anymore . in november , the goat was placed in the tiger 's compound in a wildlife park near vladivostok with the expectation that the big cat would eventually kill and eat him . but the two not only tolerated each other , they appeared to become friends . the odd couple became a popular topic on social media , and t-shirts celebrating them went on sale . but timur started pushing it , constantly annoying and butting the tiger . " finally , the tiger could n't hold back , grabbed the goat by the withers and tossed him , " park director dmitry mezentsev told state news agency tass on friday . " we decided to put them in different enclosures for a while , " he said . but the split certainly is n't without its humor : " timur is currently in good health , he says hi and promises to be less cocky from now on and advises other goats to keep it smart , " mezentsev says , per rt , which has video and a still-by-still breakdown of the goat getting the tiger 's , er , goat .
