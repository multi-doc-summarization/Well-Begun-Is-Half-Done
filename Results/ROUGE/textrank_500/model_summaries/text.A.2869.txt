tmz has the scoop on why selena gomez was largely absent from the public eye over the summerâ€”and it did n't have anything to do with justin bieber or any other petty drama that tmz is often known for exposing . the singer revealed thursday morning via an instagram post that she had n't been out promoting her new music because she was healing after a kidney transplant , which was necessitated by her lupus . the kidney donor shown holding hands with gomez from their hospital beds in the accompanying pic : francia raisa , deemed gomez 's " best friend " by tmz and other outlets . " there are n't words to describe how i can possibly thank my beautiful friend francia raisa , " gomez wrote . " she gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me . " buzzfeed and people note gomez has been open in the past about her struggle with the chronic autoimmune disease , which can result in the inflammation of different organs , including the kidneys . that openness carried through on instagram , where the 25-year-old not only posted the pic of herself and raisa , but also a couple of images showing her post-surgery , including the scar she now sports across her abdomen . gomez also included a link to the lupus research alliance for those interested in more information about this " misunderstood " disease . " i am incredibly blessed , " gomez wrote on instagram , adding to raisa : " i love you so much sis . "
