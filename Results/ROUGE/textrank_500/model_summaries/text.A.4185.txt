kim jong un has allegedly had two men put to death using a method he 's been said to have used before : by anti-aircraft gun . south korean newspaper joongang ilbo reports by way of an unnamed source that two men were publicly executed earlier this month . it identifies the men as ri yong jin , a high-ranking official in the education ministry , and hwang min , the former agriculture minister . the men 's alleged offenses : ri fell asleep while in a meeting with kim and was " arrested on site and intensively questioned " ; corruption charges followed . in hwang 's case , unspecified " policy proposals he had pushed for were seen as a direct challenge to the kim jong un leadership , " says the source . while kim is thought to have ordered at least 70 executions since taking power in 2011 , bloomberg highlights one difference with the current case : if ri and hwang were in fact put to death , they are the first from outside the workers ' party or the military to have met that fate on kim 's orders . the guardian notes the news has not been independently verified , nor has it been announced by the kcna . the south korean newspaper suggests the executions were in part prompted by a high-profile defection and carried out as a way of reasserting control over the country 's elite . ( ri 's alleged situation has echoes of another from 2015 . )
