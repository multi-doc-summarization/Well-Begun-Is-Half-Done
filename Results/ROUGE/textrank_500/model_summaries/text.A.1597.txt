" the shock also damaged the switch contacts , which had to be intact for the weapon to detonate , " the national security archive 's bill burr explains . the incident was first mentioned in a book by eric schlosser last year , but the report confirms just how close the us came to devastation . as cnn points out , the mk39 bombs had an explosive yield of 3.8 megatons ; the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki were 0.01 and 0.02 megatons , respectively . " there would have been a 100 % kill zone for 8.5 miles in every direction , " said the air force weapons specialist tasked with disarming the bombs . " by the slightest margin of chance , literally the failure of two wires to cross , a nuclear explosion was averted , " secretary of defense robert mcnamara said at the time .
