president trump has claimed he would " love to " be interviewed under oath by special counsel robert mueller and that he 's " looking forward " to it . his lawyers , however , are worried that trump will make false statements , potentially leading to a charge of lying to investigators , and have urged him to turn down any interview request , the new york times reports , citing " four people briefed on the matter . " rebuffing the interview might lead to a subpoena and a legal battle that could go all the way to the supreme court , but lawyers including john dowd , who 's representing trump in the investigation , believe mueller wo n't be willing to subpoena trump and force him into a showdown , the insiders say . white house lawyer ty cobb supports full cooperation with mueller 's investigation , but he 's outnumbered by opponents , the times ' sources say . newt gingrich is among those close to trump who have publicly said that he should reject any request to be questioned . " the idea of putting trump in a room with five or six hardened , very clever lawyers , all of whom are trying to trick him and trap him , would be a very , very bad idea , " gingrich said on fox and friends recently . cnn reports that trump 's team is arguing that mueller has n't reached the " high threshold " of evidence he would need to have trump interviewed . ( trump has to decide whether to release a democrat-authored memo on the russia investigation . )
