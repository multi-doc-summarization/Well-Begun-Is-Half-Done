ruth bader ginsburg : booze-swilling supreme court justice , part-time actress , and … new namesake of a praying mantis . scientists from the cleveland museum of natural history were examining 30 praying mantis specimens when they discovered that species—typically classified using a male specimen—could be differentiated simply by looking at female genitalia , according to a release , per the washington examiner . they then noticed that one specimen , collected from madagascar in 1967 , was actually a unique species bearing a resemblance to 83-year-old ginsburg . as scientists explain , the so-named llomantis ginsburgae has a neck plate that brings to mind the jabot , or frilly collar , often found around the justice 's neck . since the researchers were the first " to use female genital structures to delimit a new species of praying mantis , " and ginsburg has devoted much of her life to gender equality , it only made sense to name the insect in her honor . " as a feminist biologist , i often questioned why female specimens were n't used to diagnose most species , " the lead researcher says . " it is my hope that our work not only sets a precedent in taxonomy but also underscores the need for scientists to investigate and equally consider both sexes in other scientific investigations . " the llomantis ginsburgae species—kept in a paris museum—is described in the journal insect systematics & evolution . ( does this frog species look oddly familiar ? )
