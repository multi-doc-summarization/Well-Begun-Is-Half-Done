a generally gushing review in the new york times of a book by its own washington correspondent hit an internet landmine when it referred to the book as " chick nonfiction , " observes new york magazine . the reconfiguration of the term " chick lit " was no doubt meant to be witty when douglas brinkley discussed jodi kantor 's bestseller the obamas , which follows the first couple 's relationship in the white house . but bloggers and tweeters are stunned . the label seen as a sexist slight by many comes in the wake of years of criticism of the times for predominantly reviewing books penned by male authors . " that alleged lack of respect—and to call a book 'chick nonfiction ' is to call it unserious—extends not only to the woman who is the author , but also to the woman who is the subject , " notes the scroll , referring to michelle obama . when a woman writes even a serious book in times-land , argues novelist jennifer weiner , " it can only be gossip , and the writer , however skilled a reporter , is still merely a chick . " a washington post blogger took the opportunity to zing the times . the obamas is " among the very best books on this white house , " notes ezra klein . " it ’ s a serious , thoughtful book on the modern presidency in general . so no , i ’ m not going to call it ‘ chick nonfiction. ’ ” so far no response to request for comment from the times , notes the scroll .
