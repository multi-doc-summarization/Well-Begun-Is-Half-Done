justin bieber may be an international pop star , but he ’ s also a teenage boy—and lately , he ’ s been proving it . on a recent international flight , biebs and his entourage reportedly started cussing , loudly , in first class . a mom of two ( who should probably now be your hero ) approached the group and , a source tells tmz , asked justin to “ stop yelling curse words and using that kind of language on a plane . it ’ s not appropriate. ” an embarrassed bieber apologized , a friend says . but apparently he ’ s just as loud at home : on the view yesterday , celebrity couple kristen bell and dax shepard revealed that justin recently moved into a house behind them , people reports . " the music and the parties and the paparazzi , i mean , it 's like living in lebanon now , " shepard said . bell added , " in his defense , i will say we do n't know the exact house the music is coming from . we just know since he moved in , the music has been blaring .
