a tense 2016 lies ahead on the korean peninsula after a north korean nuclear test that could mark an alarming leap forward in the country 's technology . pyongyang claims that it successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb for the first time , though experts say the wednesday morning explosion— believed to have caused a 5.1-magnitude quake—was closer in size to north korea 's three previous nuclear tests than to a hydrogen bomb explosion , reports the washington post . kim jong un claimed last month that the country had an h-bomb , a weapon much more powerful and harder to make than an atomic bomb , and a confirmed test would almost certainly lead to tough new sanctions against north korea , the ap reports . north korean state media reported that the test of the " miniaturized " h-bomb was a " perfect success . " it could be weeks before an h-bomb test can be confirmed by outside experts , who seem skeptical of pyongyang 's claims . " given the scale , it is hard to believe this is a real hydrogen bomb , " a rep from the korea defense and security forum tells reuters . " they could have tested some middle stage kind [ of device ] between an a-bomb and h-bomb , but unless they come up with any clear evidence , it is difficult to trust their claim . " the australian broadcasting corporation reports that the united nations security council plans to hold an emergency meeting wednesday to discuss the nuclear test . ( at the start of 2016 , kim said he was ready for war . )
