president trump says his previously undisclosed one-on-one with vladimir putin was no secret and no big dealâ€”and the media is " sick " for suggesting otherwise . trump reportedly spoke to putin for around an hour after leaving his seat during a couples-only dinner with other leaders during the g20 summit . he had met with putin earlier in the day with aides present . " all g 20 leaders , and spouses , were invited by the chancellor of germany , " trump tweeted late tuesday . " press knew ! " in a statement , the white house said the talk was a " brief conversation " and any insinuation that the administration tried to hide it " is false , malicious , and absurd , " usa today reports . " the fake news is becoming more and more dishonest ! " trump said in a second tweet . " even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in germany is made to look sinister ! " but despite efforts to downplay the meeting , some analysts say it raises security concerns . besides putin and trump , the only person party to the conversation was putin 's translator , meaning there is no independent american account of the meeting and what was discussed . " if i was in the kremlin , my recommendation to putin would be , 'see if you can get this guy alone , ' and that 's what it sounds like he was able to do , " former ambassador to ukraine steven pifer tells the new york times .
