the impeachment of south korean president park geun-hye , and the scandal surrounding it , all comes down to a canine . park 's downfall started over ties with choi soon-sil , a close friend for decades embroiled in criminal controversies and secretly advising parkâ€”and who got into an argument with the eventual whistleblower over her daughter 's pup , the new york times reports . ko young-tae relayed his story at a parliamentary hearing last week , noting he and choi got into a tiff after she discovered the dog , which he 'd been asked to walk , alone in his apartment while he was out golfing . he says that after they exchanged words , he decided to come forward with what he knew about choi and park . ko , 40 , an ex-member of the nation 's fencing team and called choi 's " boy toy , " had worked at a seoul " host bar , " where male workers entertain female customers with conversation and sexual services . the korea times says he reportedly met choi at one of those bars in 2006 , though he testified last week he 'd been introduced to her by a pal in 2012 ( and he denied at last week 's hearing they were ever a couple , per the bbc ) . regardless of how they met or their official status , their relationship allowed him to reportedly get his hands on park 's clothing choices for a trip overseas , as well as videotape of choi ordering two presidential aides around ; he turned that footage over to a korean cable network , which aired it in october . " she insulted me and acted as if her underlings were subhuman , " he said in his testimony , adding that after the dog fight , she " treated me like a slave , swearing at me many times , " per the bbc . some of his compatriots say ko is a national hero for his revelations . " you opened pandora 's box , " one lawmaker said during the hearing .
