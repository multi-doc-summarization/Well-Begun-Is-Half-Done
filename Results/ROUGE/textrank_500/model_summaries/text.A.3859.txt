" dear gerald a : congratulations on being identified as one of the elite college football fans in the nation . you have worked diligently to separate yourself by exhibiting unrivaled tenacity , character , and loyalty . " not a bad way to start your appeal to a season-ticket holder if you 're trying to get him to renew—but perhaps penn state should 've checked its mailing list before sending this one out . the letter was sent to the pennsylvania home of jerry sandusky , the college 's former assistant football coach and convicted sex offender , kdka reports . the letter to sandusky—who of course is n't at his home because he 's in prison for about 60 more years—is signed by head football coach james franklin . kdka says it obtained photos of the letter from joe ziegler , who runs framingpaterno.com and says he received the missive from " someone inside the sandusky household " other than sandusky 's wife . penn state released a statement about the letter , explaining that a mass mailing went out to about 30,000 people . " clearly , a mistake was made and our database needs further updating and cross-referencing , " says the statement . ( ncaa sanctions against penn state were only recently removed . )
