chelsea clinton is getting some attention for comments she made to fast company when asked about following her parents into politics . her answer has always been a " visceral no , " says the 34-year-old resident of new york city , but that 's no longer the case : " i live in a city and a state and a country where i support my elected representatives . if at some point that were n't the case , and i did n't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congresswoman or either of my senators—and i 'm lucky to live in a state where i have lots of women representing me , you know—maybe then i 'd have to ask and answer the question for myself , and come to a different answer . " at the washington post , aaron blake points out that clinton has said something similar publicly on at least one other occasion , though she has never been so specific about possible offices . as for the two senatorial posts in new york , democrat kirsten gillibrand is 47 and chuck schumer is 63 . ( dad thinks clinton ought to aim a little higher than a senate seat , of course . )
