the trump attorney who says he penned the " sloppy " tweet that some say indicates a possible obstruction of justice is n't done making headlines . john dowd spoke to axios ' mike allen , scoffing at criticism of the tweet regarding mike flynn , which suggested trump knew the former national security adviser had lied to the fbi before trump canned james comey . " the tweet did not admit obstruction , " dowd says . " that is an ignorant and arrogant assertion . " plus , the constitution has trump 's back , per dowd . " [ the ] president can not obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [ the constitution 's article ii ] and has every right to express his view of any case , " he claims . newsweek notes it 's not clear which section of article ii dowd refers to , though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion " of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices . " allen notes that with this pronouncement , trump 's legal team is " setting the stage " to keep trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the russia probeâ€”meaning , allen speculates , that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike . but one of barack obama 's former counsels notes " it is certainly possible " for trump to have obstructed justice , and allen points out richard nixon 's articles of impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that nixon " has prevented , obstructed , and impeded the administration of justice . " but whether trump can or ca n't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot , allen adds . " the one thing everyone agrees on is that the house of representatives , with its impeachment power , alone decides what is cause for removal from office , " he writes . " for now , at least , the house is run by republicans . "
