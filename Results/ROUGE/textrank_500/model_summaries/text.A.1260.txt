chris brown was kicked out of a malibu rehab facility last week , and tmz says it knows why . first off , he violated a rule specifically imposed on him because he assaulted rihanna : to keep at least two feet away from all women ( he touched a woman 's hands and elbows ) . the other violations ? he went on an unauthorized outing last week and refused a drug test when he returned , and disrespected a group-rehab session by making " harsh comments . " now , because rehab was a mandatory part of his probation in the rihanna case , the singer is back in jailâ€”and mtv reports that a judge today ordered him to stay there for a month due to his " inability to stay out of trouble . "
