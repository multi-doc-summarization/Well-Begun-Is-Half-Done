the av club loves the obituary for an 85-year-old woman in wisconsin named mary " pink " mullaney . why ? maybe because her family filled it with lessons imparted by mullaney in life , including , “ never throw away old pantyhose . use the old ones to tie gutters , child-proof cabinets , tie toilet flappers , or hang christmas ornaments. ” explains mullaney 's daughter to waow : " we said , 'how can we be like her and carry her pinkness across ? ' " some other gems : " go to a nursing home and kiss everyone . " " put picky-eating children in the box at the bottom of the laundry chute , tell them they are hungry lions in a cage , and feed them veggies through the slats . " " never say mean things about anybody ; they are 'poor souls to pray for . ' " " make the car dance by lightly tapping the brakes to the beat of the song on the radio . " " if a possum takes up residence in your shed , grab a barbecue brush to coax him out . if he does n't leave , brush him for twenty minutes and let him stay .
