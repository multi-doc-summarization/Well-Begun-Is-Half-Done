this is either a big fan of the cartoon rick and morty , a hopeful collector , or a very brave and nostalgic soul : a packet of 1998 mcdonald 's szechuan sauce has sold for $ 14,700 on ebay , reports time . the strange background : mcdonald 's put out the dipping sauce in that year as a publicity tie-in for the disney movie mulan , and it received a giant nostalgic push when the character rick from the popular adult swim show pined for it in a recent episode . that led to a viral campaign for mcdonald 's to bring it back , complete with multiple change.org petitions . the company has hinted it might do so , and hopeful fans have noted that a remake of mulan is in the works for next year . but the ebay sale is the strangest component yet . " i just bought a really old car , while cleaning it i found a packet of this sauce , " the listing stated . " after watching the recent episode of rick and morty i went online to see if it was worth anything . turns out it was . also this comes with a packet of wasabi as well . " a post at eater notes that what it calls " nostalgic food " is popular on ebay , " but this is an unusually high price tag . " no word yet on the identity of the buyer , or plans for the sauce , but the daily dot is issuing a challenge : the character rick would definitely eat the stuff , " so how about it , new owner of rare mcdonald â€™ s mulan dipping sauce . are you squanchy enough to be a rick ? " ( a brother recently drove his sister to mcdonald 's , which is notable only because they have a combined age of 11 . )
