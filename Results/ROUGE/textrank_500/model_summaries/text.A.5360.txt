critics are predictably split on president obama 's much-hyped daily show appearance last night , but no one seems to think he single-handedly saved—or doomed—democrats : though jon stewart and obama are both funny in their own ways , they managed " to not be very funny together for the show 's entire 22 minutes , " writes hank stuever in the washington post . " obama seemed resiliently cool as ever , ready-made for just about anything one can do on television ... but that anything—a surprise moment , or a difficult question , or a failed attempt at humor—never quite arrived . " also in the post , dana milbank weighs in : " as in his mtv appearance a couple of weeks ago , obama did n't try to connect with his youthful audience . he was serious and defensive , " and even had " a brownie moment " when he insisted that " larry summers did a heckuva job . " but at least " obama has been willing to bring his presidential platform to settings his predecessors might have regarded as unconventional , to say the least , " writes sheryl gay stolberg in the new york times , noting that " the gentle ribbing was perhaps a price the white house was willing to pay for the opportunity to reach mr. stewart ’ s valuable audience . " as far as stewart is concerned , the president 's " presence was enough to quiet grumbles from some on the left that an election-eve snark-fest [ saturday 's rally to restore sanity ] made light of the real dangers of republican control , " write ben smith and byron tau on politico . " stewart played a comic , not a courtier , to obama on his set , but he also let the president appear to be in on the joke . " to watch the interview , click here .
