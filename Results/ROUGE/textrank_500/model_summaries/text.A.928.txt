is president obama facing a revolt from his democratic generals ? nancy pelosi certainly doesn ’ t seem happy . she offered a surprisingly blunt critique of the president and his team recently , buried within this howard kurtz newsweek piece on obama ’ s newfound populist punch . “ i think you need to talk about how poorly they do on message , ” pelosi grouses . “ they can ’ t see around corners ; they anticipate nothing . " rumor has it that harry reid isn ’ t happy , either . take this one with a grain of salt , but conservative washington times columnist joseph curl writes today that there ’ s a “ story making the rounds in washington ” that reid and obama have been on the outs ever since obama , in a secret meeting , nixed a debt ceiling deal that both the house and senate thought could pass . “ i ’ m not going to do anything for that [ expletive ] again , ” reid is rumored to have declared afterward . curl does not cite any sources .
