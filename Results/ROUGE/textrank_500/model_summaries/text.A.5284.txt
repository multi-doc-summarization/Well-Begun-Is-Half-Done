whoops : viewers watching the emmys last night were dismayed when a montage celebrating shows that came to a close this year gave away the endings of many of those shows , sky news reports . among the series spoiled : mad men , sons of anarchy , nurse jackie , parenthood , and boardwalk empire . " welcome back to the spoiler awards , " host andy samberg said when he came back onstage . " i guess everyone on every show died . " there was outrage on twitter , the new york daily news reports , but not everyone was sympathetic to the complainers . for example : " to everyone complaining about spoilers : most of those shows ended in the spring . if you have n't watched you 're not going to , " tweeted one person . but , as another pointed out , " hey # emmys , we aren â€™ t all @ andysamberg ! not everyone can lock themselves in a bunker and watch all the shows . "
