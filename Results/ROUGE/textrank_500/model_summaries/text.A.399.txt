justice anthony kennedy may end up casting the deciding vote in one of the supreme court 's biggest cases this termâ€”and he appears to be leaning toward joining the court 's more liberal justices when it comes to reining in gerrymandering . the court heard arguments tuesday in a redistricting case from wisconsin , where democrats say republicans created districts so lopsided that they violated voters ' constitutional rights . kennedy , a reagan appointee , seemed skeptical of the arguments made by lawyers defending the wisconsin voting map and did n't ask any questions at all of the lawyer representing the democratic voters , which " would seem to bode well for the challengers , " scotusblog notes . justices including ruth bader ginsburg said it was time for the supreme court to step in and stop partisan gerrymandering , though chief justice john roberts said he worried that the court itself would be seen as partisan if it started striking down voting districts , the new york times reports . that would " cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country , " he said . republicans including arnold schwarzenegger and sen. john mccain are siding with democrats on the issue . " it is time to say hasta la vista to gerrymandering and it is time to terminate gerrymandering , " schwarzenegger said outside the court , per the milwaukee journal sentinel .
