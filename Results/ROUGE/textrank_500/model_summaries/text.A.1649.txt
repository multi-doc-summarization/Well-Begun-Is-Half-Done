if you were concerned that michele bachmann 's swiss citizenship meant she 'd given up on america , worry no longer : she 's getting rid of it . " today i sent a letter to the swiss consulate requesting withdrawal of my dual swiss citizenship , which was conferred upon me by operation of swiss law when i married my husband in 1978 , " she said in a statement , according to minnesota public radio . " i took this action because i want to make it perfectly clear : i was born in america and i am a proud american citizen . " bachmann hopes to put an end to the story that surfaced earlier this week . at the time , her spokeswoman described the situation this way , notes the la times : " congresswoman bachmann 's husband is of swiss descent so she has been eligible for dual citizenship since they got married in 1978 . however , recently some of their children wanted to exercise their eligibility for dual citizenship so they went through the process as a family . " her opponent in november , jim graves of the democratic-farmer-labor party , has called the swiss story a " distraction . " he has confirmed that he and his family are also " proud to be americans . "
