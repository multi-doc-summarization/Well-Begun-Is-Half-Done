the new york mets ' owners have avoided a trial over what they knew about bernie madoff 's ponzi scheme by settling today with the trustee for madoff victims for $ 162 million , the new york times reports . trustee irving picard had sued fred wilpon and saul katz for $ 1 billion ( later knocked down to $ 386 million ) , saying they disregarded warnings about madoff 's dealings ; they claimed ignorance . much of the $ 162 million will be balanced by money katz and wilpon will receive as " net losers " from the scheme themselves . katz and wilpon say they 're due $ 178 million as madoff victims ; they 'll get a percentage of whatever picard can obtain from the beneficiaries of the schemeâ€”money that will include the cash from their own settlement . so what does all this mean for the mets ? wilpon and katz probably would n't have settled had it put their team ownership at risk , espn notes . but the team is still tens of millions of dollars in debt to bank of america and major league baseball , among others . the upshot : for wilpon and katz to maintain ownership of the team , they 'll be counting on fans ' attendance .
