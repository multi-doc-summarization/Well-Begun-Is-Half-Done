got an old yahoo email address kicking around that you have n't checked in a year or so ? better log in over the next few weeks if you 'd like to keep it . otherwise , yahoo is going to free it up for someone else . the example it uses is letting someone claim an address of " albert @ yahoo.com " rather than " albert9330399 @ yahoo.com . " it may sound like some harmless house-cleaning , but this is a " spectacularly bad idea , " writes mat honan at wired . " it means that people will be able to claim yahoo ids and use them to take over other people â€™ s identities via password resets and other methods , " he writes . if someone has a seldom-used yahoo account as a backup to gmail , for example , this raises the possibility that the new owner of the yahoo address will figure out a way into the gmail account . yahoo insists it will take pains to make sure that any recycled id is safe and secure , but honan wants the company to rethink this one . otherwise , " this is going to lead to a social engineering gold rush come mid-july .
