elle dropped a hollywood bombshell tuesday : gal gadot made a piddly $ 300,000 for wonder woman while henry cavill got a staggering $ 14 million for man of steel . this striking example of the gender pay gap sent shock waves through twitter despite being , in the words of one inside source , " ridiculous . " according to the hollywood reporter , the figures cited in elle were " cobbled together " from multiple publications and were n't comparing the same things . vanity fair explains the $ 300,000 figure is gadot 's pre-negotiated base salary , while cavill 's reported payday would have included post-release bonuses . still , no one can verify cavill ever got anything close to $ 14 million . one source says of the figure : “ it certainly isn ’ t for one picture . that ’ s insane. ” actors leading their first big blockbuster typically get something more in line with gadot 's reported base salary . chris hemsworth made $ 150,000 for thor , adam driver got $ 500,000 or so for star wars : the force awakens , and chris evans is said to have made about what gadot did for his first outing as captain america . in fact , sources say that an " apples to apples comparison " between contracts for gadot and cavill show she made the same , if not slightly more , upfront as her fellow dc hero . and with the success of wonder woman , bonuses and contract re-negotiations should soon kick in . elle updated its original story , adding : " although the pay gap persists in hollywood , this example is not adequately supported by the information available .
