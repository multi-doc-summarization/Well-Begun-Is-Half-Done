" tesla has made several false and defamatory statements about [ martin ] tripp in an effort to discredit him , " a lawyer says . the guardian specifically mentions musk claiming on june 20 that tesla " received a call at the gigafactory that he was going to come back and shoot people . " per cnbc , a tesla rep added " a friend of mr. tripp " claimed he would " shoot the place up . " tripp—who 's painted himself as a whistleblower concerned by tesla 's " dangerous " practices , including alleged use of punctured battery cells repaired with glue , per business insider—described the claim as " insane . " a day later , the local sheriff 's department announced " there was no credible threat . " that 's because there was no phone call , and if there had been , tesla acted with " at least negligence " in publicizing the information before investigating , reads tripp 's lawsuit , filed tuesday in nevada , per ars technica . it further notes tesla seemed to know tripp 's location during the law enforcement investigation and " provided false information " to authorities when claiming it could " verify " the 40-year-old was " armed . " " we 're … interested in getting to the bottom of how the story was concocted , " a lawyer for tripp tells the guardian . tripp , who denies tesla 's claim that he wrote software used to lift data from factory computers ( he says he ca n't even code ) , is seeking at least $ 1 million plus punitive damages for alleged defamation , invasion of privacy , and intentional infliction of emotional distress . his lawsuit notes he 's received " numerous threats " to his safety .
