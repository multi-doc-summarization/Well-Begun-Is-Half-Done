scientists have made a long-sought—and controversial—breakthrough : they created stem cells from cloned human embryos for the first time , reports ap . in theory , the development by researchers at oregon health & science university means that doctors might someday be able to grow tissue from an ailing patient 's own dna , thus reducing the chance of rejection in a transplant . commonly cited examples are growing brain tissue to help a patient with parkinson 's disease , or pancreatic tissue to help diabetics . it 's " one landmark step in a very long journey , " says an expert at children 's hospital boston who was n't involved with the work . the oregon scientists say they do n't think the embryos used in their process could develop into babies , reports nbc news , but the procedure is nonetheless controversial because it requires that the embryos be destroyed . nature notes that competing technology in the last decade has made the push toward embryonic stem cells less intensive , but adds that the new paper in cell is sure to reignite the debate . the scientists used eggs from donors , and it took six years to replicate the success they had with monkey embryos . they chalked it up to a series of small revisions over the years instead of a single aha ! moment .
