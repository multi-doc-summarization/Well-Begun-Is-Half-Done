the deputy director of the white house 's office of national drug control policy admitted yesterday—only after much prodding—that pot is less dangerous than alcohol and other drugs . michael botticelli was questioned at a house oversight committee hearing by rep. gerry connolly , a virginia democrat , who first asked how many people die from marijuana overdoses per year , the raw story reports . botticelli said he did n't know , but that it 's " very rare . " botticelli then admitted there 's no comparison between the volume of marijuana deaths and deaths from prescription drugs . but when connolly turned the line of questioning to alcohol , botticelli deflected the question—twice . connolly finally ordered him to answer : " when we look at deaths and illnesses , alcohol , other hard drugs are certainly—even prescription drugs—are a threat to public health in a way that just isolated marijuana is not . isn ’ t that a scientific fact ? or do you dispute that fact ? " responded botticelli , " i do n't dispute that fact . " connolly used that to argue that president obama was n't being reckless when he said he does n't think pot is more dangerous than alcohol . botticelli went on to clarify that despite that comment , the white house opposes states legalizing marijuana , cbs news reports . he added that obama thinks pot " is a public health challenge and that we need to deal with it as a public health challenge .
