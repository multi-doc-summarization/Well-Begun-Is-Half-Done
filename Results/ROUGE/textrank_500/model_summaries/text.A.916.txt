there 's been lots in the news about russia lately , and a high-ranking us army general just added to the mixâ€”this time regarding the country 's involvement with the taliban . gen. curtis scaparrotti , the supreme allied commander of europe for nato , told the senate armed services committee thursday that he 's noticed an uptick in russian influence on the insurgent group in afghanistan , and he raised the possibility that moscow is giving the group supplies , reports reuters . russia and the taliban deflected any insinuation that their relationship has ventured into equipment provisions , with taliban officials telling reuters that russia has offered only " moral and political support . " as for russia 's take on a possible supply chain : " absolutely false , " a russian foreign ministry rep told ria novosti , via the tasnim iranian news agency . as stars and stripes notes , russia has tried to evade full-on criticism for its taliban rapport by claiming the militants are going after isis , not afghani forces . however , army gen. john nicholson , in charge of us forces in afghanistan , has said he rejects the " public legitimacy " that russia tries to impart on the taliban . nbc news reports that scaparrotti 's theory comes just hours after reports that the taliban had taken hold thursday of the district center of the " hotly contested town " of sangin , although that has n't been confirmed . scaparrotti did n't offer any elaboration on what provisions he thinks may have been offered by the russians , or when this supposed handover may have taken place .
