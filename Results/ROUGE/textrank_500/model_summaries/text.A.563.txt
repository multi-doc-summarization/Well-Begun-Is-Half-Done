attention : miley cyrus is “ not trying to be slutty , ” she insists . sure , she likes to flash a lot of skin ( as photos show , she ’ s recently taken to going pantsless ) , but that ’ s just because she feels “ more comfortable dressing with a little less , ” she tells the ap . “ what i 'm trying to do is to make a point with my record , " which is called ... wait for it ... ca n't be tamed , " and look consistent , in the way my record sounds and the way i dress. ” and while she says she ’ s grown into her sex appeal ( she is all of 17 now , remember ! ) , “ that ’ s not what i 'm trying to do to sell records . i want people to buy my record because of my music. ” meanwhile , perez hilton—currently in hot water for posting an upskirt photo of miley—insists she was wearing underwear in the picture and says he was simply pointing out “ she was exiting this car in a very un-ladylike fashion . ”
