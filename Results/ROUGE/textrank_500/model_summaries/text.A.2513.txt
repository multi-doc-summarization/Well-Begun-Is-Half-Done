as far as discoveries go , this one is literally huge : an aquifer holding more than 100 billion tons of water that covers an area larger than west virginia has been discovered beneath greenland 's snow-covered ice sheet . and it caught the researchers who stumbled on it in 2011 off-guard , with lead study author richard forster telling livescience , " we thought we had an understanding of how things work in greenland , but here is this entire storage system of water we did n't realize was there . " as for the " where , " the aquifer was identified in the southeast part of the country , ranging from 15 to 160 feet beneath the surface , whose snow acts as an insulator , keeping the water liquid year-round . forster gives this great description of how the water is stored , per the bbc : " in the air space between the ice particles , like the juice in a snow cone . " but the find has raised plenty of questions , like : how old is the water ? does it stay where it is , or trickle to the sea ... or rush toward the sea in a flood ? in a separate study , the team determined that if released , the aquifer 's water could push global sea levels up 0.015 inches . and in terms of sea level rise , livescience explains that scientists have long assumed that most of the water produced in the country 's annual surface melt streams toward the ocean , or eventually refroze ; the aquifer is essentially a " new hiding place , " one that researchers can study to get a better grasp on the annual melt . says forster , " we need to understand it more completely if we are to predict sea level rise .
