norm macdonald posted a very long series of tweets last night about saturday night live 's 40th anniversary reunion special , and in it , he explains why eddie murphy did n't have a more prominent role on the special . murphy , who had n't returned to the snl studio in more than three decades , only ended up on stage for 70 seconds , and all he did was give thanks for " being remembered for his contribution to the show , " people reports . but the writers originally wanted murphy to play bill cosby in a celebrity jeopardy sketch that would also feature macdonald as burt reynolds . it was macdonald 's job to convince murphy , and they talked it over for " a good hour , " macdonald tweeted . the idea was a video daily double with the category of " potent potables , " macdonald said , in which " cosby would be mixing a drink in a video that was taped 6 months ago . " so what was the problem ? murphy " knew the laughs would bring the house down . eddie murphy knows what will work on snl better than any one , " macdonald tweeted . but " eddie decides the laughs are not worth it . he will not kick a man when he is down . eddie murphy , i realize , is not like the rest of us . eddie does not need the laughs . " according to the daily beast , cosby responded to the murphy story by saying , " i am very appreciative of eddie and i applaud his actions . " over at salon , mary elizabeth williams scoffs at the idea that cosby is " down , " writing , " you don ’ t want to do a bit , don ’ t do a bit , but don ’ t you dare turn it into an 'aw , shucks , let ’ s go easy on the guy . hasn ’ t he suffered enough ? ' moment . " the skit did go on , with kenan thompson as cosby . as for murphy , mediaite reports that his actual appearance on the show was extremely awkward , and nbc edited it to make it appear less so . watch celebrity jeopardy and the edited version of murphy 's appearance in the gallery .
