a first-of-its-kind study reveals that humans make up a minuscule portion of life on the planet . as in 0.01 % , reports the guardian . the flip side of that ? despite the scant figure , humans have reshaped the animal kingdom , helping wipe out about 83 % of mammals and half of all plants since civilization began , according to the comprehensive survey in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . for this study , researchers were n't counting individual members of species . this is all about weight—they surveyed the earth 's biomass , meaning the carbon content in living creatures . start with this : all life on the planet weighs about 550 gigatons , notes science . the new study breaks down that figure , including these highlights : plants account for an astounding 82 % of the planet 's biomass bacteria make up 13 % —leaving just 5 % for everything else beyond plants and bacteria fungi ( think yeast , mold , and mushrooms ) make up 2 % ocean life makes up a surprisingly small 1 % chicken and other poultry make up 70 % of all birds on the planet ; only 30 % are wild livestock ( mostly cows and pigs ) make up 60 % of all mammals ; humans account for 36 % of mammals , leaving only 4 % as wild " the fact that the biomass of fungi exceeds that of all animals sort of puts us in our place , " says harvard biology professor james hanken , who was n't part of the study , per a release at phys.org .
