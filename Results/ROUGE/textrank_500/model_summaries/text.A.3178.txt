an attempt at " upskirting , " an exploding camera , and a guilty conscience led to â€¦ no arrest in wisconsin , but the story is still attracting attention nationwide . the wisconsin state journal reports on the unidentified 32-year-old man at the center of it all , showing up tuesday at a madison police station to turn himself in for what he 'd intended to do : take pictures up women 's skirts by using a shoe camera . the washington post notes it 's not exactly clear what a " shoe camera " is , but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded , injuring his foot , officer david dexheimer tells the journal . after getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast , the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman , who encouraged him to turn himself in to police , dexheimer says . there 's a wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person 's clothes without that person 's consent , but the man in this case caught a lucky break : per madison police chief mike koval 's daily " significant calls " blog , " the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken . " koval notes there is an ongoing investigation , however . ( in some places , upskirting is legal . )
