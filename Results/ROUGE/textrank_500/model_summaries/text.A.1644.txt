they set sail aboard the carnival fantasy , but a florida couple 's experience aboard the cruise ship was less fantasy , more creepy nightmare . while some couples find towels adorably folded into the shapes of animals in their cabins , chris and dana white say they instead stumbled upon a hidden camera pointed at their bed , ensconced in tv wires in their room on carnival 's fantasy , which was sailing out of mobile , ala. , last october . the couple tell inside edition in an interview that aired monday that they were " flabbergasted " to spot the camera , and that their " privacy had been invaded . " " i was thinking , ' i ca n't believe this is actually happening to us , ' " chris white says . they 're talking to the media now because they do n't think the cruise line properly dealt with the issue when they reported it , saying a rep for carnival initially told them the device was n't a camera . in a statement to usa today , carnival calls the incident with the whites a " unique and unusual one " and says that while a " video transmitter " was indeed found after a full probe , the transmitter " was not connected to an electrical source and not capable of recording . " chris white shakes his head at that , saying the device was " wired up … working … [ and ] warm to the touch . " newsweek notes one other " bizarre " cruise ship incident that took place in september , this time involving a royal caribbean ship out of australia . in that case , about 1,300 employees from an indian tobacco company booked a vacation on the voyager of the seas and basically ran " amok " with women they brought aboard dressed as playboy bunnies . ( passengers say there was a " bloodbath " on a carnival ship earlier this year . )
