the brock turner controversy rumbles on : a defendant from a very different background than the former stanford student received a much harsher sentence from the same judge in a similar case , the guardian reports . according to court records , santa clara county superior court judge aaron persky oversaw a plea deal earlier this year involving raul ramirez , a 32-year-old man from el salvador who sexually assaulted his female roommate . ramirez , who needed an interpreter in court , agreed to plead guilty in a deal that will see him spend three years in state prison , while turner will spend just six months in county jail . critics say that if persky had treated ramirez as leniently as he treated turner , a white 20-year-old , the latino man would have ended up with a much lighter sentence or even have avoided prison . the deal " shows that turner got consideration not available to other defendants who aren ’ t as privileged , " says michele landis dauber , a stanford professor leading a campaign to recall persky , who 's a former stanford student . persky 's days on the bench may be numbered—a recent poll found that 66 % of people in santa clara county would vote for his recall , palo alto online reports—but a group of stanford law grads is urging dauber to reconsider the recall campaign , the stanford daily reports . in an open letter , they argue that it will be more effective to fight for " educating future judges and jurors about the realities of sexual assault , or pressing for systemic changes in how these cases are handled . " ( persky was removed from another sexual assault case earlier this month . )
