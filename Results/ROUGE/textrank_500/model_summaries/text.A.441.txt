donald trump 's transition team sent a memo with 74 questions to the energy department this week , among them a request for the names of people who have worked on climate change issues recently . specifically , it requested a list of all employees and contractors who attended the un 's annual global climate talks during the past five years , reuters reports . the energy department responded tuesday with a refusal . " we are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department , " says a department spokesperson , who added that the trump team 's request " left many in our workforce unsettled . " many media outlets are framing the trump team 's request as an attempt to " purge " the energy department of certain workers . " we will be forthcoming with all publicly available information with the transition team . we will not be providing any individual names to the transition team , " the energy department spokesperson continued . an official at the union of concerned scientists applauded the energy department 's response , calling the trump team 's request " absurd and dangerous , " and an anonymous department of energy employee called the trump memo " the first draft of an eventual political enemies list . " white house spokesperson josh earnest said the request for a list of names " could have been an attempt to target civil servants ... who are critical to the success of the federal government 's ability to make policy , " and a civil service expert tells the washington post that even if named employees were n't fired , they could be " marginalized " in other ways . ( trump has made an interesting choice for the head of the energy department . )
