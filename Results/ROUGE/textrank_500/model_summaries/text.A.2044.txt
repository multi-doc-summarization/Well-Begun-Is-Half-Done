at this rate , greek banks may soon start to look like a canny investment . the athens stock exchange had its worst drop on record yesterday when it reopened after being closed for more than a month , and things have not improved in early trading at the main greek stock market today , reports reuters . the index as a whole is down 4 % , but the four main banks are down almost 30 % . that is the maximum single-day fall allowed , and comes on top of a 30 % fall yesterday . but us investors do n't have too much to worry about , reports the ap : there is a good chance your mutual fund includes some greek holdings , but even funds that specialize in emerging markets typically have only around 0.5 % invested in greece .
