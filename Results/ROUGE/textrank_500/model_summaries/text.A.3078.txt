what does defeat sound like ? this : " we have reached the conclusion that this is not a winnable battle at this time . " that was the pronouncement of seattle councilwoman lisa herbold tuesday in advance of what ended up being a 7-2 vote to reverse a new tax the council had unanimously approved only a month prior . the so-called " head tax " would have generated just shy of $ 50 million annually to put toward homelessness and affordable housing by charging businesses that generate more than $ 20 million in revenue a year about $ 275 per employee . that would have hit about 3 % of businesses in the city , one of which is amazon , which would have contributed about 25 % of the expected total , reports npr . the company was vocal in its opposition . and per seattlepi.com , the " stunning wealth " of amazon , starbucks , and the rest of the opposition drove the reversal . as councilwoman lorena gonzalez explains , " i have been unable to find a way forward that we could out-fund and out-resource the opposition campaign by november " ( the opposition was campaigning for a referendum on the tax in the fall ) . " money has funded this campaign that put us in a position where we have to repeal this law . " the ap characterizes city leaders as having " underestimated the frustration " over not just the tax but the fact that while $ 68 million was spent on homelessness last year , a january count found the homeless population in the seattle area up 4 % , to 12,000 , suggesting to some that the city 's current resources were n't being used appropriately .
