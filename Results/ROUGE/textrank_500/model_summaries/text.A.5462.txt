bill cosby has been pretty quiet since rape accusations against him started becoming big news , but this week tweets appeared on his twitter feed for the first time since nov. 17 . " thank you @ whoopigoldberg , " he tweeted tuesday , following that up yesterday with " thank you @ missjillscott , from the cosby family . " goldberg defended cosby on the view back on nov. 20 , saying she planned to " reserve my judgment because i have a lot of questions . " one of those questions : " perhaps the police might have believed [ the allegation ] , or the hospital , " she said . " don ’ t you do a kit when you say someone has raped you ? " and scott defended cosby and his " magnificent legacy " on monday , us reports . meanwhile , three more alleged cosby victims came forward yesterday , people reports . gloria allred , who is representing them , held a press conference stating that cosby should put $ 100 million in a fund for his alleged victims—and also waive the statute of limitations on sexual assault claims , which would allow the women to sue him . " it could be advantageous for mr. cosby to give up the statute of limitations because there is a huge cloud on his reputation and legacy , " she said . " if mr. cosby believes all the women are being untruthful , then this is his opportunity to prove it . what could be fairer than that ? " in the wake of the press conference , cosby delayed two shows he was scheduled to do in new york saturday , tmz reports . ( roseanne barr recently deleted a controversial cosby tweet . )
