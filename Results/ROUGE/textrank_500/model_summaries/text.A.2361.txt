president trump 's deputy assistant was a wanted man during his seven-month stint in the white house , the guardian reports . a warrant out of hungary states sebastian gorka has been wanted on charges for " firearm or ammunition abuse " since september 2016 . according to buzzfeed , the warrant is still active . it 's unclear what gorka did to earn the warrant , though he has boasted in the past of regularly carrying two pistols and was stopped trying to carry a pistol through an airport in 2016 . a hungarian news outlet reports the warrant could be from an incident in 2009 . gorka , a former breitbart writer , tells the guardian the warrant is " more # fakenews . " on twitter he responded to coverage of the warrant by saying he moved to the us in 2008 . new york notes gorka did n't necessarily have to be living in hungary to have been there at some point in 2009 . gorka 's actual role at the white house was unclear before he left in august ( he claims he resigned , but reports say he was fired by new chief of staff john kelly ) . however , it does appear gorka was wanted by hungary at the same time he met with that country 's foreign minister as a white house adviser , which is , if nothing else , slightly ironic .
