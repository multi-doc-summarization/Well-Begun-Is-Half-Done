europe has hundreds of billions of reasons to try to keep greece from unceremoniously ditching the eurozone . if greece leaves , the rest of europe would face catastrophic losses , reuters reports . greece would default on the roughly $ 250 billion in debt held by the ecb , imf , and other eurozone nations , and that loss will likely be " high enough to eliminate the ecb 's capital , " one investor said . and the losses would n't end there because europe would still probably have to prevent a total collapse or risk economic contagion . how bad could it get ? one guardian estimate puts the total cost at $ 1 trillion . but it 's looking increasingly unlikely greece will abide by its bailout deal ; new elections are looming , and polls favor alexis tsipras ' far-left party . in a bbc interview , tsipras urged europe , and particularly angela merkel , to " stop playing poker with the lives of people " by demanding such harsh austerity measures . that defiance has some european decision-makers pushing to rip the band-aid off and boot greece . " it 's going to hurt , absolutely , " one diplomat tells reuters . " but is it going to be lethal ? "
