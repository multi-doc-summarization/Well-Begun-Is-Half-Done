there 's a disclaimer at the bottom of the news nerd site clarifying that articles found therein " are purely satirical , " but the thousands of people who shared one of the stories on facebook and twitter this weekend may not have noticed said disclaimer . the satirical article in question , published april 11 , claimed that aretha franklin and patti labelle got into a fistfight at an atlanta concert in march . but people seemed to believe it when it went viral , gawker reports , and now franklin is suing news nerd—for $ 10 million . franklin tells the detroit news , through her publicist , that the news nerd article was " not presented as satire or humor . it was presented as a serious news story intended to depict me in a slanderous and derogatory way—defamation of character . " here are a few lines from the " serious " story : " onlookers say labelle quickly removed her wig and earrings as she approached franklin . aretha , knowing that the removal of earrings is a tell-tale sign that a fight is about to ensue , attempted to prepare herself for the confrontation . franklin was quickly struck with a mayweather style right and left and stumbled backwards , landing awkwardly . " franklin had on tuesday issued a rather amusing statement after the article started to pick up steam : " i 've never heard anything crazier ... on march 20 , i was in new york city readying for my birthday patty ( sorry . lol . laughing at my typo error ) . i meant party , which we all had one fabulous time . patti and i are cool and we always have been .
