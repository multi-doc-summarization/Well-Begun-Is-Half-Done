what is believed to be the world 's oldest library is set to reopen to the public in the coming months , and the architect behind its restoration ca n't wait to share its " magical aura , " the guardian reports . “ one of the startling aspects about restoring a building this old is that you never know what ’ s behind a wall , " aziza chaouni tells the national . " you could scrape it and find a painting , take out the painting and find a door . " one such door at morocco 's khizanat al-qarawiyyin library—founded in 859—is made of iron and has four locks , the keys for which were held by four separate people . the ancient library was committed to protecting its most valuable works . that spirit of protection continues on in the restoration of khizanat al-qarawiyyin . chaouni and her team have added underground canals and temperature controls to keep unwanted moisture from the ancient texts , some of which date back to the 600s . they 've also added a machine to keep the works just moist enough to prevent cracking . of the 4,000 or so books the restoration is protecting , the most valuable is a copy of the koran written on camel skin from the ninth century , bustle reports . the library is scheduled to reopen by 2017—five years after the restoration project began . chaouni hopes it will be embraced by the people " like a second home . " ( researchers made a " fantastically exciting " koran discovery at a library last year . )
