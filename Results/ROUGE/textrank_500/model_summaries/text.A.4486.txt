" people are panicking . " that 's the message from one immigration lawyer after hundreds of undocumented immigrants were rounded up this week by ice agents in raids in new york , chicago , atlanta , los angeles , and the carolinas , the washington post reports . according to npr , the raids were the first since president trump signed a jan. 26 executive order on undocumented immigrants . that order redefined " criminal alien , " expanding the definition beyond the couple million " bad hombres " the president mentioned during the campaign to include undocumented immigrants who are only suspected of a crime or those who 've committed low-level offenses , such as using a fake social security number to get a job , the hill reports . all last week , homes and businesses were raided in broad daylightâ€”a change in tactic from the obama administration that one government aide says is possibly meant to " send a message " under trump . immigrant advocates are also reporting that ice agents are stopping immigrants at random or going door to door in minority-heavy neighborhoods to ask for ids , though ice denies these tactics . there have also reportedly been major raids in kansas , texas , florida , and virginia . many advocates see this week as punishment for sanctuary cities and an attempt to " instill fear " in immigrants . and while officials maintain they 're targeting undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records , advocates say it does n't help their case that the first deportation under trump was a " working mom with two us kids .
