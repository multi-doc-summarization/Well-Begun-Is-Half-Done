if brain size relative to body size determines iq , the venerable shrew would be the smartest creature on the planet . but it does n't , and it 's not , and scientists from austria , the netherlands , and germany have combed through 88 studies with more than 8,000 participants to confirm in the journal neuroscience and behavioral reviews that when it comes to intelligence , brain size simply does n't matter . " although a certain association is observable , brain volume appears to be of only little practical relevance , " says jakob pietschnig from the institute of applied psychology at the university of vienna . the researchers write that " positive associations between human intelligence and brain size have been suspected for more than 150 years . " why the long-held belief in such a link despite a lack of concrete evidence for it ? it may partly be the result of publication bias , reports sciencealert . this means that journals more readily publish findings with strong links between subjects than weak or inconclusive links . and that 's all that pietschnig and his team found when they reviewed published and unpublished studiesâ€”a link too small to have any discernible effect . " rather , brain structure and integrity appear to be more important as a biological foundation of iq , whilst brain size works as one of many compensatory mechanisms of cognitive functions , " pietschnig adds . this helps explain why men , who tend to have larger brains than women , do not perform better on iq tests . to be small-minded , then , should be construed in only a metaphorical sense .
