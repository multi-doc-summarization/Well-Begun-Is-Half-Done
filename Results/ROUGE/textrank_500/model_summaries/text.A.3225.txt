injury , it seems , is nothing new on and around the six flags roller coaster where a woman died last week . between april 2008 and april 2013 , the park reported 14 injuries tied to the texas giant , though three occurred before or after patrons rode it , the ap reports . the gravest injuries were apparently concussions and strained musclesâ€”but with the park reporting the data itself , " the numbers that we hear about are typically the tip of the iceberg , " says a safety analyst . and while fatal roller coaster accidents are rare , " most times that you have death accidents , it was something either ignorant or human error , " adds a safety inspector for amusement parks . meanwhile , the coroner says friday 's victim received " multiple traumatic injuries " in her fall , the dallas morning news reports . her name , officials say , was rosa ayala-goana , not rosy esparza , as her family had said ; esparza is her husband 's last name . amid word that there may have been a problem with her harness , the inspector notes : " at the end of the day , it comes down to whether or not the person fits ... if the harness locks normally , without forcing it , it 's ok. and the final say is up to the ride operator to tell you , ' i 'm sorry , you ca n't ride .
