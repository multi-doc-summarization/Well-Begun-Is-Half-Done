a # capybarawatch hashtag is making the rounds online in the hopes that the public can help track down two giant capybaras that flew the coop of a toronto zoo more than two weeks ago , national geographic reports . the aptly nicknamed bonnie and clyde made a run for it on may 24 as they were being relocated to a different enclosure at high park zoo . capybaras , native to south america , are known as the world 's largest rodents , weighing as much as a grown man ( up to 220 pounds in captivity , less in the wild ) and reaching a length of 4 feet . what could make finding these two escapees difficult : they adapt well to new environments , can make do with plants that usually are n't on their dinner plates , and can hide out quite well in the water—and the zoo is surrounded by lots of it . what toronto residents do n't have to worry too much about with bonnie and clyde , who 've already earned their own twitter parody account , is being attacked : although there have been occasional reports of the creature biting humans , " when it senses danger , it dashes toward the nearest deep water at a gallop , " a capybara expert tells national geographic . oddly enough , even though the rodents are huge as far as rodents go , they may not be simple to spot . " they can be deceptive in the proximity of humans , " a university of sao paulo wildlife ecologist says . still , rescuers may be getting closer : citynews notes traps were set out around toronto after one of the creatures was spotted sunday , and a citynews reporter had another sighting friday morning when he saw one of the animals taking a dip in a pond in high park . ( a worker at a california water-treatment plant ran into a capybara a few years back—and his pics went viral . )
