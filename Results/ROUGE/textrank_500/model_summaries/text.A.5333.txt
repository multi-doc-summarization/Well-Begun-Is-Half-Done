the obama administration is planning to restore access to federal college subsidies for a huge number of americans who have a lot of time on their hands . congress banned inmates at the state and federal level from receiving pell grants in 1994 , but education secretary arne duncan says he 'll have an " important announcement " to make when he visits a maryland prison this week , reports politico . the administration will be able to temporarily lift the ban without going through congress by treating the restoration of grants as an experiment in reducing re-offending rates , reports the wall street journal , which notes that prisoners received $ 34 million in pell grants in 1993 . pell grants are worth up to $ 5,775 a year , which rep. donna edwards , co-sponsor of a bill to permanently restore the grants to prisoners , notes is a lot less than the $ 40,000 or so it costs to keep an inmate behind bars for a year . " we have n't really been able to get a handle on recidivism , " the democrat tells the journal . " we have to present some training and opportunities . these are programs that work . " the prison population has doubled in the 20 years since the grants were removed , and the bill 's co-sponsors say inmates who take part in education programs are 43 % less likely to end up back in prison , politico notes . ( this month , president obama became the first sitting president to visit a prison . )
