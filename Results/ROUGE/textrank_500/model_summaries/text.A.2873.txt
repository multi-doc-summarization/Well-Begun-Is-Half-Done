it has to rank among the less usual undertakings doctors at massachusetts general hospital had attempted : in 2009 they removed a molar from a severed egyptian mummy 's head via an endoscope with grasping forceps they inserted through the neck . the tooth was a hopeful clue in a nearly century-old mystery—one that still would n't be solved for years to come . the head ( see it here ) was discovered in 1915 in deir el-bersha , south of cairo , in a room built for a governor named djehutynakht and his wife 4,000 years ago . it had been looted by grave robbers , and the identity of the head—was it djehutynakht 's or his wife 's ? —remained unclear . a dna test could provide the answer , but no mummy of that age had given up usable , reliable dna , and " the ancient dna community had largely given up on the testing " of such remains , per a report in the journal genes . the molar was their best bet , and scientists tried and failed to get it to give up its dna . then , in 2016 , the tooth made its way to the fbi 's dr. odile loreille , a forensic scientist with a long history of working with old and ancient dna ; the new york times reports she has identified korean war victims , a 2-year-old who died on the titanic , and the remains of two children of russian tsar nicholas ii . she managed to retrieve a tiny bit of powder—just 0.004 ounces , per livescience—from the tooth 's core , and the ratio of chromosomes it contained proved it was male dna : governor djehutynakht . the times sums up the significance : " in doing so she had help [ ed ] establish that ancient egyptian dna could be extracted from mummies . " ( this egyptian coffin is " dowdy , " but the inside is astonishing . )
