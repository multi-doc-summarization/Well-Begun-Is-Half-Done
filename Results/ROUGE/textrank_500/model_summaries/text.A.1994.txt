jane austen is going on britain 's 10-pound note in 2017 , reports the bbc . and the guy she 's replacing is no slouchâ€”charles darwin . along with her image will be a quote from austen 's pride and prejudice : " i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! " the guardian calls the decision " surprisingly apt " given how frequently the theme of money comes up in austen 's novels , even if it finds the choice of quote a little " safe . " so why the move ? the push began earlier this year when the bank of england announced that winston churchill would replace prison reformer elizabeth fry on the 5-pound note . critics pointed out that would leave no women on the nation 's currency , except for the queen . and as the la times notes , this week 's birth of a certain royal baby means that britain will be ruled by kings for decades after the 87-year-old queen dies . austen 's presence means at least one woman will remain on the money .
