orlando shooter omar mateen not only called police during the massacre at pulse nightclub but also , apparently , a tv station . news 13 producer matthew gentili says he was handling the phones just 2 miles from the club around 2:45am sunday as viewers called in to ask about the shooting when he received a call that changed him , per fox news . the caller asked if gentili knew about the shooting , then announced , " i 'm the shooter . it 's me , " gentili says . the caller began speaking fluent arabic until gentili asked him to speak in english . " i will never forget the words he said to me , " says gentili . he said , " i did it for isis . i did it for the islamic state . " the caller refused to tell gentili where he was . when gentili asked if the man had anything more to say , he said no and hung up . gentili was interviewed by the fbi , which did n't confirm the call came from mateen , but news 13 says the number matched the shooter 's phone . the timing also makes sense , per the washington post . the first shots rang out around 2am . authorities say mateen called 911 around 2:30am and eventually had two short conversations with a dispatcher . the call to news 13 would have followed . " i 'm never going to be able to answer the phone again without thinking this is the most serious call i 'll ever get in my life , " gentili says .
