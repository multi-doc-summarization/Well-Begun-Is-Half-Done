the force was not with sen. ted cruz on sunday when he tried to use star wars references to win an argument on net neutrality—with luke skywalker . buzzfeed reports that it began saturday when mark hamill tweeted a picture of fcc chair ajit pai wielding a lightsaber in a video he made to defend killing obama-era net neutrality rules . hamill said pai was " profoundly unworthy " because " a jedi acts selflessly for the common man . " on sunday , cruz tweeted to hamill , misspelling his name as " hammill " : " luke , i know hollywood can be confusing , but it was vader who supported govt power over everything said & done on the internet . " he added : " reject the dark side : free the net ! " hamill quickly fired back with a burn : " thanks for smarm-spaining it to me , " he tweeted . " i know politics can be confusing , but you 'd have more credibility if you spelled my name correctly . i mean it 's right there in front of you ! maybe you 're just distracted from watching porn at the office again , " he said , mocking the gaffe that cruz blamed on a staffer . in a follow-up tweet , he said he regrets leaving the " l " out of " smarm-splaining " —and the fact that twitter 's 280-character limit is n't enough to unpack " all the lies and all the stupid " in a cruz tweet . cruz quoted yoda in another tweet to hamill , saying hamill had responded with anger instead of facts and asking : " who was it that said , " fear is the path to the dark side…fear leads to anger…anger leads to hate ? "
