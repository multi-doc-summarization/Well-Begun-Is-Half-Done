during some three decades with justice department , eli rosenbaum has earned a well-deserved reputation as a nazi hunter . he has worked on 137 cases involving suspected nazis , and in all but 30 of them , the accused lost citizenship or was deported . now , cnn reports , just a single active case remains . but when it comes to jakiw palij , who lives in queens , ny , deportation isn ’ t likely . in fact , a federal judge ordered the 92-year-old deported in 2004 , but the european countries he could be sent to wo n't take him . palij , cnn notes , will likely die here . " what mr. palij did prevented other people from reaching old age , " says rosenbaum , who now also oversees more recent war-related crimes as the doj 's director of human rights enforcement strategy and policy . palij is accused of being a guard at the trawniki death camp in german-occupied poland— " in the end , " rosenbaum says , " everyone who was held there was massacred . " palij , who , per the new york times , came to the us in 1949 as a refugee using falsified immigration papers , has denied any wrongdoing . in 2003 , he told the times that the nazis coerced him into service patrolling bridges and roads at night . " we knew they would kill me and my family if i refused , " he says . " i did it to save their lives , and i never even wore a nazi uniform . " the founder of the simon wiesenthal center downplayed that line of argument : " to work at those camps , you had to be eager to be there . they only took people they knew were loyal and brutal and not sympathetic to pleas of the inmates . " in a 2013 interview with npr , rosenbaum described questioning the suspects about their alleged nazi pasts as " surreal ... these people look close to harmless . " ( joseph goebbels ' " love nest " is proving to be a tough sell for berlin . )
