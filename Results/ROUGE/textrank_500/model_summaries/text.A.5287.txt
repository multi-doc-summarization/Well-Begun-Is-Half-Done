" the repayment was done in what 's likely the most expensive way possible : swissinfo.ch reports bernasconi flew to beijing to apologize and reimburse zhang . the daily meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002 . as for the story behind the man who felt comfortable paying so much for a nip of scotch , he 's a 36-year-old writer of online fantasy novels who reportedly made $ 16.8 million in 2015 .
