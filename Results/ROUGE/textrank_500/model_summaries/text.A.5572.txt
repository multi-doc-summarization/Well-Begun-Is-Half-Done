while colorado citizens are taking advantage of their state 's marijuana legalization , sheriffs there and in neighboring states are suffering a " crisis of conscience " in upholding that law , according to a suit filed against colorado today in denver . per usa today , the lead plaintiff , larimer county sheriff justin smith , calls the case a " constitutional showdown " and says he does n't know whether to enforce his own state 's mandate or the us constitution ( pot 's still not legal on a federal level ) . " [ they 're ] asking every peace officer to violate their oath , " smith says , per usa today . " what we 're being forced to do â€¦ makes me ineligible for office . " meanwhile , sheriffs in kansas and nebraska who 've joined the suit complain that tokers driving back from colorado are running up overtime bills as police have to handle a significant increase in drug arrests . this is n't the first group to take legal measures against the state . the attorneys general in nebraska and oklahoma filed a lawsuit against colorado last year , saying the free flow of pot across state lines is hurting communities . " left unchallenged , i am confident colorado 's law will cause long-term harm to nebraska families , " that state 's ag , doug peterson , wrote in an open letter , as per the la times . and two lawsuits filed last month by an anti-drug group express similar complaints and add racketeering charges into the mix , the huffington post noted in february . larimer county 's sheriff says the doj 's mostly hands-off policy in dealing with the new rules amounts to showing folks " how to violate federal law but not get prosecuted , " usa today notes . but a pot advocate says pols and cops should concentrate on more serious crimes . " these guys are on the wrong side of history , " he tells the paper .
