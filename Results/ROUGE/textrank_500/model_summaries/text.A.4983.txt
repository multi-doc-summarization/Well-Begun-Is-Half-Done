the curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life , and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought—and possibly for millions of years before that . " quite honestly it just looks very earth-like , " the curiosity 's lead scientist said , according to space.com . the lake , located in the gale crater , would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide . the lake 's mudstones—which form in calm , still water—contain traces of sulfur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus , and carbon , meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs , a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals . the lake was revealed today amidst a barrage of papers on the rover 's progress . national geographic breaks down some of the other key take-aways , including one that 's less promising for martian life hunters : curiosity 's first radiation measurements indicate levels that would be fatal , within a few million years , to anything within several meters of the surface . though the researchers did note that some classes of bacteria might have been able to survive through long periods of hibernation .
