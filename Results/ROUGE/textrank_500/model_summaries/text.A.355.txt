" it opened a great wound inside of me . i pretended it did n't happen . " so says a nun who claims an italian priest sexually assaulted her while she was confessing to him about 20 years ago in bologna . a new ap investigation finds she 's not alone : religious sisters are apparently being abused by bishops and priests in asia , south america , africa , and europe , and usually keeping quiet about the assaults . that changed this week when five nuns appeared on national tv in chile and told their stories of sexual abuse by priests and other nuns , crux reports . it 's an older story in africa , where reports have emerged of priests abusing nuns and pressuring them into abortions ; a six-year study and follow-up report for the vatican found 29 nuns impregnated at one congregation . the national catholic reporter revealed that study in 2001 , but what the church did is unclear . meanwhile , the vatican remains quiet on the issue and lacks rules to probe and punish abusers , leaving it to local church leaders to take action . " consecrated women have to be encouraged to speak up when they are molested , " says a vatican official on the condition of anonymity . " bishops have to be encouraged to take them seriously , and make sure the priests are punished if guilty . " but amid # metoo and an ever-widening catholic church abuse scandal , more nuns may be speaking up for themselves . " i see it as two freedoms : freedom of the weight for a victim , and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest , " says the nun allegedly assaulted in bologna . " i hope this helps other sisters free themselves of this weight . "
