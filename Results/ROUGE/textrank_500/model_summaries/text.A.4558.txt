a horrifying story out of uganda , where a toddler was grabbed and eaten by a leopard friday at the mweya safari lodge in queen elizabeth national park . the 2-year-old boy 's mother is a game ranger at the park and was working , and the boy was with his nanny in the kitchen of the family 's home in the park 's staff quarters , near a doorway . " he was seated with the maid when the leopard grabbed and ran with him , " the boy 's father tells the kampala post . but a spokesperson for the uganda wildlife authority ( uwa ) says the boy followed the nanny outdoors : " the maid was not aware the child followed her . she heard the kid scream for help , she intervened but it was too late the leopard had vanished with it in the bush . " the staff quarters are reportedly in a protected area that is popular with tourists , usa today reports , but the family 's home is said to be unfenced . a search team ultimately found some of the boy 's bones , including his skull , and they were buried over the weekend . the boy 's father says he expects compensation from the uwa and that the organization should do more to protect staff and their families . " uwa gave us the coffin , " he says . " i have not talked to them about the incident but i would expect something reasonable to compensate me , although my son 's life is gone . " leopard attacks on humans are rare in uganda . the uwa spokesperson says efforts are being made to locate the leopard and possibly relocate it . " the hunt is on with the intention of capturing the leopard and removing it from the wild because once it has eaten human flesh , the temptations are high to eat another human being , it becomes dangerous , " he says , per the telegraph .
