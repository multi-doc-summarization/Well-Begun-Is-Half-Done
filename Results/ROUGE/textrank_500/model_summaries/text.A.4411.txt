hillary clinton on wednesday came out against a major trade deal supported by the white house known as the trans-pacific partnership , even though she supported it in its early stages as secretary of state and later praised it in a memoir . an honest change of heart ? an nbc political analysis has a much different take : " this flip-flop is n't believable at all . " it 's all about " protecting her left flank " against bernie sanders and gaining favor with organized labor . clinton says she made her decision based on new details about the tpp , but the nbc post says her newfound " opposition is so unbelievable , it feeds every negative stereotype about herâ€”despite the short-term political benefits . " one of those stereotypes ? that she puts polls ahead of policy . at vox , ezra klein writes that clinton has provided critics with plenty of fodder on that front over the years . in this case , " knowing clinton 's record , her advisers , and her past comments about the deal , it 's hard to believe clinton really opposes the tpp deal . " so , yes , she might gain ground with the left , but these types of " convenient policy changes " undermine her greatest strength : " that she 's an extraordinary policy mind who understands these issues better than her challengers , and so can be trusted to make better decisions on them .
