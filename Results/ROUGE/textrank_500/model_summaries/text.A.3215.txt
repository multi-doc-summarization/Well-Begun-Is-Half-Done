" they came to doctors too late . … only a miracle can save them . " those were the words to the siberian times from the irkutsk region 's health minister regarding those sickened from ingesting a deadly bath oil , with dozens already dead from the mass poisoning—said to be the " worst such case in modern russian history . " the bbc reports at least 58 have died , per local media , and notes the death toll is expected to rise , as many of the more than three dozen poisoned are in serious condition . the concoction that caused the deaths was a black-market mixture promoted as a safe , hawthorn-scented alcoholic beverage , with a label that said it contained ethyl alcohol , which is ok to consume . however , it actually was made with methanol , which live science notes is a harmful chemical used in antifreeze that ( besides death ) can also cause a slew of other medical problems , including blindness . a market worker tells reuters she usually uses the oil to remove grease and remnants of old price tags still stuck on surfaces . the bbc—which notes millions of cash-strapped people in russia often resort to drinking cheap " surrogate " booze , including perfume and window cleaner—says the owners of the shop where the bath oil was made have been arrested . ( beer was n't officially considered alcohol in russia until a few years ago . )
