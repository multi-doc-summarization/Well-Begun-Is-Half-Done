" similarly , papadopoulos met with a woman he believed to be related to vladimir putin after joining the campaign , even though he told the fbi the contact occurred beforehand , reports business insider . " he believed she had connections to russian government officials ; and he sought to use her russian connections over a period of months in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and russian government officials , " per the court filing .
