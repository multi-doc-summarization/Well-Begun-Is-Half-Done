a texas judge delivered a bombshell ruling on obamacare friday night , declaring that the affordable care act is unconstitutional . us district court judge reed o'connor ruled that the individual mandate—the penalty those who forgo insurance must pay—is unconstitutional . and because the individual mandate is so integral to the aca , the entire aca is unconstitutional as well , he declared . all of which has lawmakers in both parties , as well as millions of americans who get their coverage from the aca , wondering , " now what ? " here 's what we know , including a debate over the legal principle of " severability " : what 's next : in terms of the immediate future , nothing changes , reports usa today . though much uncertainty is now in the mix , the aca remains in place while this plays out in the courts—perhaps even at the supreme court , for the third time—and the process could take months , if not years . those insured under the aca , including those who just enrolled , remain covered . the stakes : here 's how the washington post puts it : " the opinion , if upheld on appeal , would upend the health insurance industry , the way doctors and hospitals function , and the ability of millions of americans to access treatments they need to combat serious diseases . " core provisions : as the ap notes , key provisions of the aca have become popular with americans , including its protections for pre-existing conditions , expanded medicaid for lower-income americans , and the ability of parents to keep their kids covered through age 26 . all of which makes the politics tricky for the gop ; the ap says the decision " has landed like a stink bomb among republicans .
