greg barnes was in a hurry to get home on friday , so when he saw police lights behind him on state road 332 in muncie , indiana , " immediately i knew i was in the wrong , " he tells wish . what followed was " a simple interaction " that has touched hundreds of thousands of people . police officer shawn cosgrove , who is white , chatted with barnes , who is black , after running barnes ' information and handing him a warning . the talk turned to negative and even deadly police encounters , and barnes asked if the two could take a selfie ; the officer agreed . " i thought that would be a great moment , especially nowadays when there is tension all around the nation when it comes to policing , " cosgrove says . " it made me feel like our interaction could help people and children . " barnes posted the photo to facebook in a post that 's been shared some 465,000 times as of this writing . " the officer did not know me nor did i know him , but we each showed one another a mutual display of respect , " barnes writes . " neither of us are the enemy . we can continue to fight against each other until we are literally 'black and blue , ' or we can show one another the respect we inherently deserve , not as 'black man ' and 'blue police officer , ' but as humans . none greater , none less . " wgn points out the hashtag barnes ended his post with : # respect . in a subsequent facebook post made on sunday , barnes added , " together , we , the only race that matters , the human race , can all make this world a better place than we found it .
