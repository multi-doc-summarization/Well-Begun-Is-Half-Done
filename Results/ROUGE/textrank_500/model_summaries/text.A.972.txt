" it 's definitely made me reconsider everything . who was i before ? who was i then—is that part of me ? who am i now ? " the new york times reports hannah upp , a 32-year-old teacher in st. thomas , disappeared sept. 14 , a week after hurricane irma hit the virgin islands . her clothes , car , keys , cellphone , passport , and wallet were found at a beach where she had gone for a swim . upp was still missing five days later when hurricane maria battered the caribbean . upp is far from the only person missing in the wake of the storms , but her case is unique in that she may not even know she 's missing . upp has dissociative fugue , a very rare type of amnesia made famous by the fictional jason bourne . " normally , we forget things in little pieces , " dr. david spiegel says . " these people forget things in large pieces that involve what they 've done for the last year or two years . " in 2008 , upp was found floating face down in new york harbor by a ferry captain . she had been missing for three weeks at that point and remembered nothing of that period . " i went from going for a run to being in the ambulance , " upp said after her rescue . newsweek reports upp disappeared again in 2013 in maryland—this time for two days . now friends and family are hoping upp has once again entered a fugue state and did n't drown or fall victim to a crime . " my hope is that she found somewhere safe to hide , " friend maggie guzman says . official resources are stretched thin responding to the two hurricanes , so upp 's friends have been searching for her and putting up posters , hoping she sees one . " if she ’ s in her fugue state , it would at least get her to the point where she realizes something ’ s wrong , " friend jake bradley tells the virgin islands daily news .
