" there was already concern about the use of excessive force by the military . now this video seems to give us the proof , " says the chairwoman of mexico 's senate commission on human rights , per the washington post , which identifies the man shot as raul jimenez martinez , 46 . mexico 's defense ministry , however , says it will cooperate fully with an investigation launched by the attorney general 's office on may 4 .
