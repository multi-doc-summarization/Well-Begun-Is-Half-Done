leigh ann arthur taught in union , sc , for 13 years . then her decision to leave her unlocked phone on her desk on feb. 19 put an end to her career . while she was on hall patrol duty for five minutes in between classes , the engineering and computer programming teacher at union county career and technical center says a 16-year-old student grabbed her phone and found a nude photo she had taken for her husband for valentine 's day , per nbc news and wspa . " he took pictures from his cell phone of that and then he told the whole class that he would send them to whoever wanted them , " arthur tells wspa . after class , the student told her , " your day of reckoning is coming , " arthur says . it was only later she found out the photo had been seen . the student indeed shared the photo through texts and on social media , superintendent david eubanks tells wyff , adding arthur was given the choice to resign or go through a process for dismissal . she resigned last tuesday . " i think we have a right to privacy , but when we take inappropriate information or pictures , we had best make sure it remains private , " eubanks tells the state . arthur says the student has n't been punished . she plans to press charges and has also complained to the union public safety department , which is investigating . " the whole premise of my privacy being invaded is being ignored and that 's what 's wrong , " she says . some 1,000 people have signed a petition to have her job restored , though arthur says she 's not sure if she 'd take it . ( in neighboring north carolina , teenagers are the ones facing trouble over racy photos . )
