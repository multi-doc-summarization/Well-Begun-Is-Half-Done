india is giving up attempts to recover john allen chau 's body from the remote island where the us missionary was killed by tribespeople , at least temporarily . government officials , including those within law enforcement and tribal welfare , agreed monday to put the plan on hold to avoid disturbing the protected sentinelese of north sentinel island , reports the bbc . a government official adds that a boat was dispatched tuesday morning " only to check the situation . " no contact has been made with the tribe , which resists outsiders , since the 26-year-old chau is believed to have died after reaching the island on nov. 16 , per cnn . fishermen who dropped him off believe they saw his body a day later . " we know the general direction of where it was taken , but we still do n't know where exactly it is , " the official tells the bbc , referring to the body 's recovery as " too risky . " survival international said the recovery would be " incredibly dangerous , " noting the risk of disease for the islanders and past incidents that resulted in them using force in a bid to defend their home , reports the guardian . still , evidence may need to be collected before chau 's death certificate can be issued . ( the bodies of two fishermen killed on the island in 2006 have not been recovered . )
