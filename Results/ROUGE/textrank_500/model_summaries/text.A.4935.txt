this will likely come as a surprise to latino voters , but donald trump tells nbc news that he would win the latino vote . as for his comments about mexican immigrants largely being a bunch of rapists and drug dealers , he sees nothing to apologize about : " i have a great relationship with the mexican people ... i have many legal immigrants working with me . and many of them come from mexico . they love me , i love them . and i 'll tell you something , if i get the nomination , i 'll win the latino vote . " trump says he would do so by creating jobs . he also doubled down on his plan to build a wall along the mexican border , and he vowed to make mexico pay for it . for good measure , he slammed hillary clinton as the worst secretary of state in history and as weak on immigration , because she would " let everybody come in â€¦ killers , criminals , drug dealers . " during the interview , trump called nbc 's katy tur " naive , " and the daily beast accuses him of sexist mansplaining . ( actress america ferrara , for one , is probably not swayed by this win-the-latino-vote assertion . )
