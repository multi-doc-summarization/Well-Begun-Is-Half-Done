less than two weeks ago , michigan gov . rick snyder said replacing flint 's lead-coated pipes in the city 's water distribution system was n't on his " short-term agenda " and that coating the pipes with phosphates might serve as a stopgap . but it looks like flint is moving on with or without him : on tuesday , mayor karen weaver announced a $ 55 million public works project that will replace all of the city 's water pipes , and the process will begin within a month , the detroit free press reports . " all lead pipes need to be replaced , " weaver said at a press conference , per wdiv . " we deserve new pipes because we did not deserve what happened . " the mayor and other officials are hoping the project can be completed within a year with a few dozen crews and under " optimal conditions , " per weaver . around 15,000 lines will be replaced , and " high-risk " households ( those with children and pregnant women ) will be first on the list . funding for the project will come from the michigan legislature and the us congress , weaver said . and other money may show up as well : as the fbi continues to investigate the crisis , high-ranking public officials have asked for funds all the way up to the federal level . us rep. candice miller , for instance , wants the epa to hand over a $ 1 billion emergency grant . " we 're going to restore safe drinking water one house at a time , one child at a time , until the lead pipes are gone , " weaver said , per wdiv . ( a flint family is suing the city after their 2-year-old tested positive for lead poisoning . )
