michael vaudreuil first made headlines in may when the custodian received a degree in mechanical engineering from massachusetts-based worcester polytechnic institute , the very school the 54-year-old had spent the past decade cleaning . now he 's got another big announcement : a dream job with multibillion-dollar aerospace manufacturer pratt & whitney , where he 'll work as an engineer with the production integrated product team , reports the washington post , which notes the job offers " poured in " following news of his graduation . " i feel like i won the lottery , " he tells the school 's daily herd . but he 's got a message , too : never give up . " nobody 's going to question my work ethic , my energy level , or my desire , " he says . vaudreuil 's story of hard work paying off has resonated with many , but it 's also the tale of a circle completedâ€”he earned an associate degree in aeronautical engineering in 1982 . he ended up working as a plasterer , but in 2008 his business folded and he lost just about everything , including his home . when he found himself scrubbing toilets and chalkboards at wpi , he decided to make use of the school 's free tuition for employees . " the thought process was : this is it for me , " he told the boston globe in may . " your back 's against the cliff . you either jump off , or you fight for your life . " and fight he did . it took him almost 10 years to finish his degree , and even though his new gig requires a move to connecticut in advance of his july 11 start date , he 's still finishing the month as a custodian . ( this teen was in a coma during his graduation , but his classmates made sure he did n't miss it . )
