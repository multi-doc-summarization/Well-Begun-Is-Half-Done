in possibly the weirdest news you ’ ll hear all day , sex-and-drug-scandal-plagued ted haggard is going on the celebrity edition of abc ’ s wife swap reality show … and will swap partners with gary busey . yes , in case you ’ d forgotten , haggard still has a wife—despite the fact that he admitted paying for meth-fueled sex with a male masseuse in 2006 . the probably-bisexual pastor now runs a nondenominational church in colorado , and busey is apparently a good match for him : the born-again actor is involved with christian men ’ s organization promise keepers . however , busey bizarrely has no wife , just a girlfriend with whom he has a child . producers haven ’ t said whether she ’ s the swapee or not , people notes , but the colorado springs gazette reports that she is . busey , of course , has slightly more experience than haggard with reality tv , having already appeared on celebrity rehab and celebrity apprentice . but haggard , who is apparently trying for a second career in entertainment , has appeared in a christian “ sex comedy . ”
