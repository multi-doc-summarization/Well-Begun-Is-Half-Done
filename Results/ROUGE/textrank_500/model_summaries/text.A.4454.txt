critics are hopping aboard at the last station , a lively drama about leo tolstoy 's final days starring christopher plummer and helen mirren . here ’ s what they ’ re saying : “ the arrival of a movie with as much intelligence and artistry as the last station should also be accompanied by the sound of trumpets , ” writes an ebullient rex reed for the new york observer . “ this movie is passionate , profound and unforgettable. ” nearly every critic raves about mirren , who “ is a lusty roaring wonder ” playing tolstoy ’ s long-suffering wife , writes peter travers in rolling stone . “ to watch her threaten , cajole , and seduce her husband is a treat oscar voters can not ignore. ” plummer ’ s tolstoy is great , too—he ’ s “ warmly and disarmingly life-sized , ” writes joe morgenstern in the wall street journal . he calls the movie “ a lovely quicksilver version of literary history. ” but ao scott of the new york times is less impressed . “ you will certainly see better acting ” in other movies , he writes , “ but it is unlikely you will see more . to say the actors overdo it would be an understatement . ”
