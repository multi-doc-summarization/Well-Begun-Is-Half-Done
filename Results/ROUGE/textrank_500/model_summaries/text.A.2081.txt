it ’ s a thankless job adapting a literary darling like the road , and , sure enough , director john hillcoat hasn ’ t gotten much thanks . critics have mixed feelings about the bleak post-apocalyptic film . here ’ s what they ’ re saying : despite good acting , the film is merely adequate , “ an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book , ” writes kenneth turan of the la times . “ to do more than horrify and depress us , the road is in need of a finer sensibility. ” a devoted cormac mccarthy fan , roger ebert wrestles with his review . “ it is powerful , but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling , ” he writes . “ i 'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers. ” the movie can only “ dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at , ” says ty burr of the boston globe . still , it ’ s a “ welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of 2012. ” “ the road is n't a masterpiece , ” writes steven rea in the philadelphia inquirer . but it stuck with him , “ its images of dread and fear kicking around like such a terrible dream . ”
