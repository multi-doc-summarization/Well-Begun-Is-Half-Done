despite a few reviewers who think it ’ s basically an extended saturday night live sketch , the other guys snagged a high score on the tomatometer—and some are calling the will ferrell/mark wahlberg cop comedy the funniest movie of 2010 : if you ’ re tired of ferrell 's typical “ clueless blowhard , ” never fear : director adam mckay “ shrewdly varies the formula , " making ferrell the “ square ” and wahlberg the “ aspiring alpha dog , ” writes joe williams in the st. louis post-dispatch . “ the other guys is the funniest movie of the year. ” ferrell and mckay " have collaborated on three other movies , but they 've never been so slyly funny as they are in the other guys , a buddy-cop satire so hilarious that even longtime ferrell haters ( me ) ca n't resist it , ” admits connie ogle in the miami herald . “ the humor is that rare perfect balance of broad and satiric. ” fun cameos include “ samuel l. jackson and dwayne johnson in a hilarious send-up of badass cops , ” and michael keaton , who nearly steals the show “ as an emasculated police captain moonlighting as a retail store manager , ” writes joshua katzman in the chicago reader . rather than a full-length film , “ the movie ’ s best bits would stand alone nicely on youtube , or on funnyordie.com , the comic video boutique of which mr. mckay is an owner and where he sometimes dabbles in short-form hilarity , ” writes ao scott in the new york times .
