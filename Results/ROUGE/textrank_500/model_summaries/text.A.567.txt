the class of 2012 entered a tough jobs market buckling under an average debt load of $ 29,400 , according to the annual report from the institute for college access and success . that 's up from an average $ 26,600 in 2011 , and the rise can be blamed on rising tuition fees combined with stagnant family incomes . the struggling economy is a " double-edged sword in many ways because ( students ) and their parents have fewer resources to pay for college costs , which may lead them to take on more debt , " the institute 's research director tells usa today . " and then they 're entering a down economy where it 's hard to find a good job that allows them to repay the debt . " a recent study found that parents now cover an average 27 % of college costs , down from 37 % just three years ago . the institute 's report , however , found huge variation in the debt loads from state to state and college to college , with graduates at some institutions carrying an average of $ 50,000 in debt while others had an average less than a tenth of that , the new york times reports . student debt tended to be highest in eastern states , with delaware grads the most indebted at an average of $ 34,000 each . new mexico graduates had the lowest debt ; an average of $ 18,000 . but the class of 2012 is n't the most indebted graduating class in history : that dubious honor goes to the class of 2013 .
