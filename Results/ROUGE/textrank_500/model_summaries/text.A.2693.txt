there are only five dogs in america trained to sniff out electronic devices , and one of them played a major role in jared fogle 's downfall . bear , a 2-year-old black labrador , was able to sniff out a thumb drive that human investigators missed during a search of the former subway spokesman 's home last month , reports nbc news , which describes bear as a " porn-sniffing dog . " he can detect tiny memory cards easily and was trained with methods associated with " any other k-9 training , like with the narcotics or explosives or anything , " his trainer tells wish-tv . " you get the dog used to the odor and reward them as they indicate on it . " the lead prosecutor on the fogle case tells nbc that bear is a " key part of the team , " though he doubted the pooch 's abilities at first . " i thought i was being punked , but it does work , " he says . the evidence , along with that gathered by an fbi informant , helped secure fogle 's guilty plea on child-porn and underage sex charges . bear has been a busy dog : nbc reports that he also played a role in the arrest of olympic gymnastics coach marvin sharp . bear 's trainer , a deputy fire chief , sells dogs to law enforcement agencies when their training is completed , and bear will soon be on his way to seattle , where the police department contacted the trainer after hearing about the fogle case . ( fogle 's charitable foundation appears to have been a sham . )
