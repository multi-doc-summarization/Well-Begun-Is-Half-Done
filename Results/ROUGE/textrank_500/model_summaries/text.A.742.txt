good news for the fair-skinned among us : scientists in massachusetts have developed a drug that darkens and protects human skin without the damaging effects of ultraviolet ( uv ) light . dr. david fisher , a researcher at massachusetts general hospital , tells the bbc the drug initiates a series of chemical reactions that enables skin to produce sun-blocking dark melanin without exposure to dangerous uv light—which initiates the same chemical reactions , but only after damaging the skin . " under the microscope it 's the real melanin , ” fisher says . “ it really is activating the production of pigment in a uv-independent fashion . " the drug could be a good thing even for people who do n't crave a tan : dark pigment provides a protective barrier against uv radiation , reducing the risk of skin cancer . in an interview with stat , fisher says the next step will be to test the drug ’ s safety , with the first test subjects most likely being " individuals who are at the highest risk for developing skin cancer. ” if further tests prove successful the new drug could prove to be a substitute for other self-tanning activities , like lotions , which essentially paint the skin but provide no melanin protection , and tanning beds , which expose the skin to harmful uv rays and can thus be risky . still , according to science news , the drug would not , on its own , be considered a substitute for sunscreen , which blocks uv rays but has the counteractive effect of leaving skin pale and vulnerable . ideally , dr. fisher says , the drug would be combined with sunscreen in a single product .
