a prehistoric fortress is home to a much later structure : what may be one of the biggest medieval palaces ever discovered , one whose remnants remain buried beneath the ground , the independent reports . the site in southern england is surrounded by huge earthworks that date to the iron age . researchers used ground-penetrating radar and other technology to investigate what 's under the grass within the inner and outer baileys of the former fort , the bbc reports . without doing any digging , they found a large complex that leading medieval-building expert dr. edward impey believes is an early 12th-century castle . it measures about 560 feet by 210 feet and features 10-foot-thick walls and what appears to be a 200-foot-long great hall , the independent notes . " the prime candidate for constructing it is perhaps henry i , " says impey . " archaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at old sarum , " notes survey leader kristian strutt , " but until now there has been no proper plan of the site . " the archaeologists ' survey uncovered residential areas , evidence of kilns or furnaces , and an open area— " perhaps for mustering resources or people " —near some large structures , per a press release . " from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan , " says strutt . the iron age fort at the site was likely built around 400 bc and taken over by romans in 43 ad , the bbc notes . but by the onset of the 13th century , the city built in the same place became too tight and weather-beaten for habitation and was abandoned in favor of today 's salisbury , which is located roughly two miles away . ( another 'lost city ' was recently investigated using similar techniques in cambodia . )
