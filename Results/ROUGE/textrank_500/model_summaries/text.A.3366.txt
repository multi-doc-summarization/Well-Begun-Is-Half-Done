the mystery of what happened to a swedish journalist who vanished after a ride on a danish inventor 's submarine is slowly becoming clearer . though details are still scarce , copenhagen police say peter madsen , after changing his story , has confessed that kim wall died in " an accident " on board his nautilus sub and that he then " buried her at sea , " the bbc reports . officials have been searching for wall since her disappearance on aug. 10 , when she boarded madsen 's sub , which then sank off of denmark 's refshaleoen island . madsen initially claimed he had dropped wall off after they 'd cruised around for about three hours , but in a police statement cited by the local , that story has since been modified . " the accused has told police and the court that an accident occurred on board the submarine which caused kim wall â€™ s death , and that he subsequently buried her at sea at an unspecified location somewhere in koge bay , " reads the statement in the closed-door case . madsen 's explanation was released after a defense and prosecution request . although the statement also notes that " current charges remain in place , " it 's unclear what those charges are : deutsche welle notes that madsen was originally charged with negligent manslaughter , but it 's now reporting a new charge of aggressive manslaughter , which it says can lead to a prison sentence of up to eight years . a search for wall 's body in the newly pinpointed area is now underway .
