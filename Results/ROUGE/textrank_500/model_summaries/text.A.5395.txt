eric holder angrily denied that the justice department was trying to hide anything about the botched " operation fast and furious " program in his testimony before congress today—and insisted that he 'd had no knowledge of the gun-tracking operation . " there 's no attempt at any kind of coverup , " the attorney general said , pointing out that the department had turned over thousands of documents and intended to turn over more . " this has become political , i get that , " he added , according to fox news . " not only did i not authorize those tactics , when i found out about them , i told the field … that those tactics had to stop , " he said . ( the idea was to track weapons as they made their way to cartels , but authorities lost track of many . ) holder added that those responsible would likely be fired or charged with crimes within six months , once an internal investigation is finished . " i can assure you those people will be removed from federal service , " he said , according to cnn . but republicans were n't satisfied , saying he was still withholding documents , and darrell issa threatened to do whatever necessary to obtain them . issa has previously threatened to charge holder with contempt of congress .
