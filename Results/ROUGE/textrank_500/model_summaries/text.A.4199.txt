the wall street journal has a report raising hopes about the 200 or so nigerian girls still missing after being kidnapped by boko haram . us surveillance planes have on at least two occasions spotted sizable groups of girls in remote locales in northeastern nigeria . the girls had been moved by the time subsequent flights flew overhead , but the development suggests that instead of selling the girls into sex slavery as feared , boko haram is keeping them in the hopes of a prisoner swap with the government . in fact , the journal quotes a nigerian security adviser who says that boko haram leader abubakar shekau has given orders that " anybody found touching any of the girls should be killed immediately . " president goodluck jonathan has publicly ruled out a prisoner exchange , but he is up for re-election in february and under heavy pressure to bring the girls home . meanwhile , a human rights group has launched a campaign to provide educations for the girls who managed to escape , reports the catholic news agency .
