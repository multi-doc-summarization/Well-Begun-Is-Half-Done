congratulations , kfc , your double down stunt has gotten more publicity than a nazi-themed romp with jesse james . so here 's a little more , in the form of what the reviewers are saying : the double down " arrives at a new low , " writes sam sifton of the new york times . even the chain 's signature chicken is " a slimy and unnaturally moist thing , with flavor ginned up in a lab . it is , in all , a disgusting meal , a must-to-avoid . " the sandwich , which " cries out for carbs , " is " an almost total dud , " writes robert sietsema for the village voice , noting that " a peek under the top 'bun ' reveals hella-small slices of bacon and acres of white cheese . " over at slashfood , however , the concoction rated a " b " â€”though admittedly the salt was " not for the faint of heart . " and perhaps it has a higher calling than mere lunch : " we can foresee this becoming the new 'hangover food ' of choice . "
