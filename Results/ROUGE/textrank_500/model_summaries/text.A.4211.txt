noticed pete davidson 's absence from snl as of late ? well , there 's a good reason behind it : the 23-year-old has been focusing on his sobriety . after telling high times last fall that he could n't function without the medical marijuana he 's prescribed for crohn 's disease , davidson now says , " i quit drugs and am happy and sober for the first time in eight years " in an instagram post . rapper kid cudi might have inspired that sobriety , per the new york daily news . last fall , davidson told a radio station , " i would have killed myself if i did n't have kid cudi , " who 'd checked himself into rehab a few weeks earlier .
