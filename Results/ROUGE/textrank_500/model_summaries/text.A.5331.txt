the promised overhaul at malaysia airlines has begun . new ceo christoph mueller—dubbed " the terminator " —says 6,000 of 20,000 jobs at the " bleeding " airline will be slashed . " we are technically bankrupt , " says mueller , who developed a reputation for laying off workers during restructuring at ireland 's aer lingus , belgium 's sabena , and germany 's lufthansa airlines , per the bbc . " the decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014 . " before mh370 disappeared and mh17 was shot down over ukraine , the airline suffered from what afp calls " poor management , unwise business decisions , government meddling , and unfavorable service and supplier contracts stemming from malaysia 's crony capitalism . " though 14,000 workers were offered jobs , mueller says some may be fielding offers from competitors . noting the malaysia airlines brand has been blemished in some markets , mueller , hired last month by state investor khazanah , adds the airline will rebrand in september , but he remains vague on the details . the airline may also reduce the frequency of flights or the size of aircraft on long-haul routes to europe to focus more on regional flights , though a flagship route to london will be unaltered . the hope is that the airline can " stop the bleeding " in 2015 , per today 's announcement , and see growth by 2017 . sky news reports the yearlong restructuring plan will cost $ 1.7 billion .
