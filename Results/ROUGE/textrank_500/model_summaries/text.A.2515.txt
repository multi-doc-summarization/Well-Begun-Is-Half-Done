a 10-pound tumor with the potential to suffocate or break the neck of the cuban 14-year-old whose face it was covering was successfully removed in miami , but then things took a turn . the miami herald reports emanuel zayas died friday night due to kidney and lung complications at the holtz children 's hospital . emanuel suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia , which usa today reports spurs the body to grow something akin to scar tissue instead of bone ; his family initially thought the growth , which the washington post reports surfaced when he was 11 , was a pimple . his parents sought help for years , but cuban doctors were too skittish over the risks of surgery . the family finally secured a humanitarian visa . it allowed him to fly to miami on nov. 27 and undergo surgery jan. 13 at the hands of dr. robert marx , who heads up maxillofacial surgery at the university of miami health system and had once removed a woman 's 16-pound facial tumor . said marx in a statement : " after visiting emanuel last night and observing a ray of hope from his pupillary reflexes and the muscle tone of his face , i was informed this morning that his condition had turned grave . ... the physiological stress of the surgery was apparently too much for his compromised anatomy . our hopes of saving his life , and with that allowing him a better quality of life , were not realized . " marx says the teen 's body will be donated to science by the family , in hopes of learning more about the condition .
