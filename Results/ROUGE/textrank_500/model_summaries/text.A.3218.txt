impressed when an fbi forensic expert testifies in court ? jurors likely are too , but the fbi 's hair-comparison unit actually gave unscientific testimony against criminal defendants for more than 20 years before 2000 , according to the fbi and the justice dept . among the fbi 's 28 microscopic hair experts , 26 " overstated forensic matches " to favor the prosecution in nearly all of the 268 cases reviewed so far , the washington post reports . " the fbi â€™ s three-decade use of microscopic hair analysis to incriminate defendants was a complete disaster , " says peter neufeld , who helped found the innocence project . the reviewed cases include 32 defendants given the death sentence , 14 of whom have already died in prison or were executed ; about 2,500 cases involving hair matches are being looked at in all . of course , other evidence may have sufficed to convict defendants found guilty . but the fbi , acknowledging the problem , has agreed to work with the national association of criminal defense lawyers ( nacdl ) and the innocence project in reviewing cases between 1972 and 1999 . now 46 states and the district of columbia are receiving information that could lead to appeals , if defense lawyers , prosecutors , or judges are willing or able . truth is , there 's no scientific standard for matching hair , the post says . worse , the forensic-hair scandal is only part of an ongoing review of all criminal forensics , which the post has reported on here , here , and here . " the forensic science system ... has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure , " a science panel concluded back in 2009 .
