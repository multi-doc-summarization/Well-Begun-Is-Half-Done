president trump has one more big decision to make in regard to " the memo . " the house intelligence panel on monday voted unanimously to make public the democratic rebuttal to the gop 's memo on the russia investigation . as with the original memo , the president now has five days to review it and decide whether to allow its release , reports the ap . will he do so ? a tweet trump sent earlier on monday about the lead democrat on the panel , adam schiff , raises doubts about the prospect , notes the washington post . trump accused schiff of leaving committee hearings to " illegally leak confidential information " and said he " must be stopped . " schiff has previously asserted that the republican memo is misleading and intended mainly to discredit the robert mueller investigation . he and his staffers compiled the 10-page rebuttal memo in question , and schiff has said it presents a point-by-point refutation of the republican version , reports politico . the gop memo made the case that the fbi and the justice department were politically biased against candidate trump and improperly obtained permission to spy on his campaign .
