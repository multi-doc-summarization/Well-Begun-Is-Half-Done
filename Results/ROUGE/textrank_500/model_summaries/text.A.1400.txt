wine has been used as a " social lubricant , mind-altering substance , and highly valued commodity " throughout the ages . now , a discovery just south of tbilisi details just how far back through the ages the beverage has existed , the bbc reports . per a study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , archaeologists found 8,000-year-old pottery shards in the nation of georgia indicating wine was once made there in earthenware jars , the earliest evidence ever of grape-based wine production . before the discovery of the fragments from eight jars ( the oldest from circa 5980bc ) in the neolithic villages of gadachrili gora and shulaveris gora , the most ancient proof of grape winemaking came from iraq , dating between 5000bc and 5400bc . testing of the georgian pieces showed evidence of a slew of acids from wine that had been made inside the erstwhile vessels . the jars also featured images of grapes and a man dancing , and national geographic notes the presence of grape pollen in the soil . scientists believe the jars may have been stored underground during the fermentation process and , based on an intact jar found at a site nearby , were so large they could fit about 400 of today 's wine bottles , per a release . there 's even a link to modern-day vino production : the old-time jars are strikingly similar to the large qvevri jars used today in georgia . because wine was n't crucial to living in stone age times , one scientist not involved in the study tells national geographic that the find shows " far greater sophistication " during that time period than previously suspected . china still holds the overall wine record , however : evidence there for a boozy rice-and-honey based concoction dates back to 7000bc . ( archaeologists found a tiny stone that holds unparalleled ancient greek art . )
