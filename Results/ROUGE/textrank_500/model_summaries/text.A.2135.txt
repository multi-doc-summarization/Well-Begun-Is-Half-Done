you probably can already identify the contents of most of your photos , but this is still fun . a new website from stephen wolfram , whom you may know from the search tool wolframalpha , lets you drag and drop any photo ; it will then in theory identify what 's in it . right now , imageidentify manages some impressive feats , the verge reports : for instance , it was able to tell that a picture of a cow was a black angus . on the other hand , it thought a cupcake was a bottle cap . the wolfram language team is happy to acknowledge the mistakes . in a blog post , wolfram notes that " somehow the errors seemed very understandable , and in a sense very human . it seemed as if what imageidentify was doing was successfully capturing some of the essence of the human process of identifying images . " in the meantime , it does have some practical uses : at pc world , jared newman writes that " using the site , i was able to figure the breed of dog that kept following my wife and i around on our honeymoon ( miniature pinscher ) and the exact type of flower from a hike in los angeles ( larkspur ) . " and we can expect imageidentify to get better at its job , since it keeps copies of the images you post and learns from them ; its abilities come from the study of tens of millions of pictures , wolfram says . you can also tell the site whether its analysis was correct . it 's not the only such system , the verge notes , pointing to efforts like google goggles . ( what would it say about this smiley face in space ? )
