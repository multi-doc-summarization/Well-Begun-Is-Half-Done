a new hampshire woman who became stuck in her swimming pool after the ladder broke turned to the loving arms of facebook to ask for help getting out . " i had one foot on ( the ladder ) , and when i put my other foot on it , it went down . and i cracked my knee , " leslie kahn tells wbz-tv of the aug. 11 incident . the 61-year-old says she did n't have the upper-body strength to hoist herself out , and " my tenants were out , nobody was home . my phone was inside . " with few other options , kahn used a pool pole to drag the chair her ipad was on toward her and posted in a community facebook page , asking for help . she said she labeled the post " 911 " to get people 's attention . a woman who lived nearby showed up , followed by police and a neighbor . " every idea we thought of didn â€™ t work , " she says , until her rescuers thought to try a step ladder . " and i just climbed out . happily ever after at that point . " kahn , whom the ap notes is a breast cancer survivor , is apparently no worse for the wear : " people keep saying , ' i bet you can laugh about it now . ' i was laughing about it then . what else can you do ! "
