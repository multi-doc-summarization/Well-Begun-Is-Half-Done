it 's not unusual for newspaper editorials to criticize a president 's policies . but the editorial board at the los angeles times is taking the concept to a new level with a multi-part series called " our dishonest president . " part one on sunday issued a warning that president trump is " so unpredictable , so reckless , so petulant , so full of blind self-regard , so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation . " those traits may have helped him get elected as an " outsider , " but hopes that they would be reined in once he entered the white house are fading . the editorial ends with a plea for voters , protesters , members of congress , state legislators , the courts , the media , etc. , to be vigilant about protecting america from its own president . on monday , part two focuses on trump 's capacity to lie . plenty of politicians lie , of course , but what trump " brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies , if he believes they serve him , and the truth . " what makes this especially dangerous is that trump repeats the lies of others , even crackpots . " he gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief . " verification seems to be a foreign concept to trump , but it ca n't be for everyone else , write the editors , who close with advice : " investigate . read . write . listen . speak . think . ... be suspicious of those who confuse reality with reality tv , and those who repeat falsehoods while insisting , against all evidence , that they are true . to defend freedom , demand fact . " read part one and part two .
