insiders are beginning to open up about how they chose jorge bergoglio as the new pope . for one thing , he was n't part of the vatican 's troubled curia hierarchy , but it was believed he could help heal it , the new york times reports . it also helped that he did n't stake out a high public profile and project himself as a candidate beforehand , which can backfire in the world of vatican politics . " he is not part of the italian system , but also at the same time , because of his culture and background , he was italo-compatible , " says the archbishop of paris . " if there was a chance that someone could intervene with justice in this situation , he was the man who could do it best . " among the questions cardinals asked themselves : " 'is he a man of the faith who connects us to christ ? ' " said chicago 's archbishop . " next , 'can he govern ? ' " lastly , he won points for " the fact that he has a heart for the poor . " bergoglio 's pre-vote speech to the private conclave helped his selection , the los angeles times notes ; he offered a succinct call for a streamlined church free of corruption . but his selection was by no means a foregone conclusion ; indeed , cardinal angelo scola , described as a favorite of reformers , received a mistaken email of congratulations from italian bishops shortly after bergoglio 's selection . bergoglio reportedly led after the first round of voting , with scola and canada 's marc oullet behind him . he gradually built his lead in subsequent rounds until reaching the threshold of 77 votes .
