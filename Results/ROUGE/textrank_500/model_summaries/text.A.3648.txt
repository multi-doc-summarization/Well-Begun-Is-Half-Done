endangered sumatran tigers got two new additions this week : a female named damai at the national zoo in dc gave birth to a pair of healthy cubs on monday . only about 500 of the tigers exist in the wild , with 65 in zoos in north america , notes the washington post . ( that includes damai 's mate , kavi . ) the cubs wo n't be on exhibit for a few months , but you can check them out via a webcam at the zoo 's website . " all i can do is smile because the team has realized our goal of producing critically endangered tiger cubs , " says a zoo biologist . " damai came to us as a young tiger herself , so it 's really special to see her become a great mom . "
