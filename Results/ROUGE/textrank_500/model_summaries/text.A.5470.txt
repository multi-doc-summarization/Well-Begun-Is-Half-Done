noaa says it 's a whale of a success story : most of the world 's humpback whale populations , including all those that enter us waters , are no longer endangered , according to the agency . noaa , which says 45 years of protection have helped whale populations rebound , wants to reclassify the species into 14 populations , only two of which would be classed as endangered , nbc news reports . the central america and western north pacific populations , which sometimes enter us waters , would be classed as threatened under the noaa proposal , while the arabian sea and cape verde islands populations would still be considered endangered . all 14 populations would remain protected under the marine mammal protection act . " this is good news for whales and whale conservation and should be cause for celebration , not a reason to run screaming from the room , " the whale program director for the international fund for animal welfare tells science . " it shows that when we take appropriate steps to protect whales , they can recover . " a senior biologist for whale and dolphin conservation north america , however , tells the guardian that the proposal seems premature . the species is too complicated to split into just 14 populations , she says , and they still face multiple threats , including boat strikes and entanglement . ( a daring crew from the hawaiian islands humpback whale national marine sanctuary used a knife on a pole to free a 45-ton whale entangled in fishing line . )
