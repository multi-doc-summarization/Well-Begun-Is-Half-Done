a dutch organization that advises women on reproductive rights has now launched a website to help us women terminate pregnancies on their own . the guardian reports on the " self-managed abortion : safe and supported " portal , or sass , set up by women help women . through it , 23 trained counselors will answer questions and give advice if women have already decided to take the drug misoprostol . the medication , which , when taken alone or in combination with mifepristone , keeps a pregnancy from happening , is only legal in the us at medical facilities , though it can be purchased otc in central american nations . a women help women rep says the idea for the site came about after a guardian story documenting a texas woman 's trip to mexico to get the drug , and all the questions she had once she got it . the site wo n't provide pills , and organizers say they wo n't even suggest women take themâ€”they 're just there to keep women safe if they 've already decided to . " it 's worse to just remain silent , " says a uc san francisco obstetrics professor who calls misoprostol a " very safe and effective " drug ( though it 's more effective taken with mifepristone , which is n't as easy to obtain ) . for women who do have complications and must seek medical care , the washington post notes they 'll be advised that drug-induced and spontaneous abortions typically look the same , and that the drug is n't detectable via drug test . abortion foes note the meds can be dangerous if not taken correctly or if taken late in the gestation period , and that this site could put women at risk by providing info on taking them . women help women is being cautious in case of legal ramifications : its servers are located outside the us , as are its two dozen or so staffers .
