" i think it 's time to bring him home , " says richard johnson , and he 's putting up a huge reward in hopes of making that happen . the man from boulder , colo. , is referring to son ryder , who has n't been seen since jan. 17 . the 20-year-old was seen at 3pm on that day , just after his shift at the eldora ski resort near nederland ; there have been no confirmed sightings since and leads have dried up , reports the daily camera . ryder johnson 's car was found parked at gross dam road that evening , and the gross reservoir was searched afterward . now , friends and family have put together a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the younger johnson , the arrest of anyone potentially involved , or items he had on him when he vanished . the denver channel reports the reward 's distribution will be at the family 's discretion . " it 's been pretty frustrating , " said boulder county sheriff joe pelle in early february . " they 're just not finding anything , " he said of his investigation . the camera reported that foul play is possible , but there 's no evidence to that end . the other " working theories " are that he went into the mountains and harmed himself , or vanished to start a new life . pelle called those two the " strongest possibilities . " a severed foot found in a hiking boot in june at the ski resort was determined not to belong to johnson ; kdvr reports 180 acres around the resort were searched after the boot was found . the reward will expire on jan. 17 , 2017 .
