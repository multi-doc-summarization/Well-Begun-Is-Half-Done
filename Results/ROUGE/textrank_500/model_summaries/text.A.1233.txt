marking an anniversary by sharing a photo on twitter is a pretty routine thing to do , but suicide squad director david ayer did just that in a pretty atypical way yesterday . he marked the joker 's april 25 , 1940 , comic book debut by tweeting the first image released of jared leto as joker , the role he 's playing in the film . it 's a joker complete with green hair , crimson lips , nasty teeth , and a tattoo-heavy body . among the ink : " ha " repeated over and over , and a cursive " damaged " on the forehead . rolling stone reports the look was inspired by batman : the killing joke , and points out that it 's not the first time ayer has referenced alan moore 's graphic novel . that leads the magazine to speculate that leto 's turn as the joker in the film—due aug. 5 , 2016—will hew closer to moore 's joker , a bust-of-a-stand-up comic who is disfigured and goes crazy in the span of a single day . usa today also calls out a harlequin skull tattoo on leto 's chest , which it sees as " most likely an ode to his suicide squad girlfriend harley quinn . " she 's played by margot robbie . the rest of the big-name cast includes will smith as deadshot , viola davis as amanda waller , cara delevingne as enchantress , and joel kinnaman as rick flagg . what they 'll be doing , per the imdb description : " a secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency .
