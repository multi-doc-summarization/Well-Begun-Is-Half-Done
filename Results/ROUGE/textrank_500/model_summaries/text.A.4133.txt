optimists hoped today 's humanitarian cease-fire might lead to a longer peace in israel and gaza , but that 's not the case by a long shot . in fact , israel just raised the stakes considerably by launching a ground offensive into gaza , reports the bbc . a military statement said the goal was â€œ establish a reality in which israeli residents can live in safety and security without continuous indiscriminate terror , " reports the new york times . troops were expected to focus on so-called " terror tunnels " used to infiltrate the country . it 's not clear whether the ground offensive will be a quick strike or a longer one with the goal of taking control of gaza . an israeli defense official who speculated yesterday about such a move said that a takeover of gaza would n't be too much of a challenge , but that any such mission would have to last " many months " in order to fully secure the area . today 's development comes after 10 days of back-and-forth bombing , notes cnn .
