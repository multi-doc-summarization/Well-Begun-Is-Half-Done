a 7-year-old bowler in canada just learned a tough lesson about rules , or pants , or ... something . after grayson powell bowled a terrific game and prepared to collect a gold medal with two teammates , he was told he was disqualified for wearing pants that were n't black enough . so reports the cbc , which photographed grayson 's outfit and , sure enough , his black jeans are faded to a gray . " if this is what sport is about when it comes to kids ... shame on them , " said his angry father , todd powell . this odd controversy , however , was just getting started . in a long rebuttal , gord davis , provincial head of youth bowling canada , insisted the organization " did nothing wrong " and is " not to blame for how this went down . " the black jeans dress code has been in place " for decades , " he said , and rules are rules . the boy 's dad smelled a rat . he accused davis of disqualifying his son 's team so the second- and third-place teams , which bowl at lanes owned by davis , could take higher honors . davis fired back that powell was " full aware of the dress code " and sent his kid anyway . he pressed : " what parent would do this ? " as the guardian reports , one of powell 's complaints is that his son was disqualified only after bowling a 171-point game that propelled his riverdale team to the title in the newfoundland city of st . john 's . " after the story made headlines in canada , an odd-sounding compromise was reached . the disqualification stands , but the kids get their gold medals . in the future , however , all rules must be followed " no matter what , " wrote davis on facebook . ( this girl 's leggings and tunic got her in trouble at school . )
