since ditching hugh hefner at the altar a couple of weeks ago , playboy playmate crystal harris has only added to her frank critique of hefner 's lovemaking shortcomings , telling howard stern that sex with hef was over in " like two seconds , " reports people . " then i was just over it , " she says . " i was like , 'ahhh . ' i was over it . i just like , walked away . i 'm not turned on by hef , sorry . " harris also said that hefner never takes off all of his clothes ( " i 've never seen hef naked " ) and that they had sex only once . but hef is n't taking any of this lying down . in tweets that have apparently since been deleted , hefner accused harris of lying during her stern appearance , adding that he did n't know why she would do such a thing , gossip cop reports . “ the sex with crystal the first night was good enough so that i kept her over two more nights , " he continued . “ crystal did a crazy interview with howard stern today that didn ’ t have much to do with reality . is she trying to impress a new boyfriend ? ”
