marijuana enthusiast snoop dogg launched a website yesterday , and of course it 's all about weed . merry jane , which the rapper announced at techcrunch disrupt , is what techcrunch describes as an " information hub " for all things pot ; snoop says it will be a sort of cannabis encyclopedia giving users " all they need to know . " there will be shows and videos centered around the marijuana lifestyle , including a food show ( cooking with cannabis or pairing meals with pot ) , celebrity interview videos , and a show called " deflowered , " which will feature people doing something for the first time . there will also be editorial content looking at marijuana news from legalization to pot policy to the business side and the politics of pot . and , of course , there will be a database featuring all sorts of cannabis strains so that users can decide which one is right for them and where they can find it . it sounds pretty high-tech , featuring " high-res rotating imagery for every product listed " and allowing users to search via type , flavor , or even symptom . right now the site is in beta ( " i 'm givn away 420 sneak peeks a day , " snoop tweeted . " sign up now at http : //merryjane.com & put 1 n the air ! ! " ) but it will be open to the public within the next few weeks .
