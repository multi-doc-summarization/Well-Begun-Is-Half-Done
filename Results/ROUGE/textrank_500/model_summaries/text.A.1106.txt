you know those copies of usa today that sometimes get left outside your hotel room door ? apparently they 're not free , at least not at the hilton garden inn sonoma county airport , which one guest learned to his dismay . now rodney harmon has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the hilton chain over the 75-cent charge , the san francisco chronicle reports . harmon says he stepped over the paper as he left the room . but a few days later , he noticed a small warning on his key card pouch informing him of the charge , according to the new york times . " he did not request a newspaper and assumed it had been placed there by hotel staff , " reads harmon 's suit , which adds that the hotel allegedly tried to hide the charge by listing it in an " extremely small font which is difficult to notice or read " on the key sleeve . further , the suit accuses the hotel of an " offensive waste of precious resources and energy , " since newspaper readership is down and most of the papers left for guests probably do n't get read . though the 75 cents is " a piddly sum , " writes ben popken at the consumerist , " the case could have big implications if it becomes the impetus to sue other hotel chains , since many hotels do just the same thing .
