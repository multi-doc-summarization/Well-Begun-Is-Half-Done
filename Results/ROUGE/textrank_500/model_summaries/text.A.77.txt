amid rising nuclear tensions , two figure skaters friday became the first north korean athletes to qualify for the 2018 winter olympics , which will be held just 40 miles south of the demilitarized zone in south korea , cnn reports . according to the new york times , 18-year-old ryom tae-ok and 25-year-old kim ju-sik , who have been training in canada with a french coach , finished with a score of 180.09 at the nebelhorn trophy in germany . it was a career-best performance in an international competition for the pair . kim says they were motivated by their coaches and the people cheering for them . ryom agreed : " there were many people of different nationalities and backgrounds cheering for us . the fact that we gave them some kind of joy , that was the best part in the performance . " while kim and ryom 's sixth place finish in germany was enough to nab them one of the final spots in february 's olympics , it remains unclear if they 'll actually compete , reuters reports . the decision rests with the north korea olympic committee . both south korea and the international olympic committee have been pushing for north korean athletes to participate in the games , hoping it will be a diplomatic balm for the countries . the ioc has been providing travel , equipment , and accommodation to north korean athletes attempting to qualify ( north korean skiers and speed skaters still have a shot ) , and south korea 's president said north korea will have as much time as possible to decide if it will participate . north korea boycotted the 1988 summer olympics in south korea , but it did send a women 's hockey team and taekwondo team to competitions in south korea this year .
