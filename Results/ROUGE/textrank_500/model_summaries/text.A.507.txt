the buffalo bills made a power run through a glass ceiling on wednesday by hiring kathryn smith , the first full-time female member of coaching staff in nfl history . smith , who has worked in the nfl since 2003 and joined the bills last year as an administrative assistant to head coach rex ryan , is the new special teams quality control coach , reports the buffalo news . she started out at the new york jets , where she became a player personnel assistant in 2007 and was promoted to assistant to the head coach in 2014 . " she certainly deserves this promotion based on her knowledge and strong commitment , just to name a couple of her outstanding qualities , and i just know she 's going to do a great job serving in the role of quality control-special teams , " ryan said in a bills press release . her hire is a big step for the nfl , bleacher report notes , although there are already full-time female coaches in mlb and the nba , leaving the nhl with some catching up to do . ( last summer , the arizona cardinals made jen welter the first woman to hold any kind of coaching position in the nfl . )
