an estimated 2.5 billion people saw the image : a starving polar bear struggling across an arctic landscape . " the mission was a success , but there was a problem : we had lost control of the narrative , " writes cristina mittermeier in national geographic . accompanied by a photographic team , she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague paul nicklen shot video—all part of their " mission to capture images that communicate the urgency of climate change , " she writes . " when paul posted the video on instagram , he wrote , 'this is what starvation looks like . ' " he also wondered if all 25,000 polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint . but he did n't say climate change had killed this bear . that nuance vanished when national geographic posted the video with the subtitles " this is what climate change looks like " and the washington post ran a dramatic headline about " gut-wrenching " images . people also responded dramatically , expressing gratitude for validation of climate science , anger the crew had n't fed the bear , or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming . " perhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full story—that we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we didn ’ t know what had happened to this particular polar bear , " she writes . yet a fast-warming arctic means bears will be stranded on land , unable to pursue prey , so the photo makes sense . the trick for next time ? make sure " our intentions are clear and the narrative remains our own . "
