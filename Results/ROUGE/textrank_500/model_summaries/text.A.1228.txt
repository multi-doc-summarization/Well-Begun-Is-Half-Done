the keystone state , which set sail in 1849 as one of the largest and most luxurious steamer ships of its time , sank during a november storm in 1861 with 33 people aboard . no one knew its fate for more than a week , until debris was spotted , and it 's been lost since then—until now . a shipwreck hunter found it at the bottom of lake huron , 40 to 50 miles from where it was last seen and far from where david trotter expected to find it . some historians say the ship may have been secretly hauling civil war supplies when it sank , the detroit free press reports—and there are even rumors it may have been carrying gold , according to michigan live . by 1857 , after an economic downturn and the rise of the railroad , many ships like the keystone state were considered too pricey to operate . by 1861 , however , thanks to the civil war , the keystone state had been taken out of storage and refurbished . it picked up its cargo in detroit—officially , farm implements , hardware , and grain , but " it was an emergency shipment , " a historian explains ; he adds that typically a ship would n't have made a trip like that so late in the year . also suspect : the ship was n't carrying any lifeboats ( everyone aboard died in the wreck ) , which could indicate it left in a hurry . trotter 's team found her using side-scan sonar in july , and has since made 30 dives at the site—which turned up no gold or cargo . some speculate that the crew dumped the cargo in a bid to save the ship . ( another ship was found this year in lake superior . )
