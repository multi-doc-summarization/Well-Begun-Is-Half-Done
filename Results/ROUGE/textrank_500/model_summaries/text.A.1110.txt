" nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment , neglect , abuse , insecurity , and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this , " he wrote . the couple , echoing a recording sandusky made before sentencing , blamed his downfall on a vast conspiracy involving police and the media . in one letter , dottie describes the couple 's adopted son , matt , who accuses sandusky of molesting him , as a liar and a thief , the philadelphia inquirer reports . a spokesman for the state attorney general 's office describes sandusky 's behavior as " banal , self-delusional , completely untethered from reality . it was entirely-self-focused , as if he himself were the victim .
