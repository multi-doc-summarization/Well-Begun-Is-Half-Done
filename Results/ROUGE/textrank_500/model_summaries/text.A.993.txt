two vermont lawmakers fed up with delays to legalize marijuana in the state introduced a headline-grabbing measure this week designed to move things along : one that would outlaw alcohol . legislators chris pearson and jean o'sullivan admit they have no interest in reinstating prohibition , but they want to make a larger point , reports vermont public radio . in their eyes , marijuana is safer than alcohol , so why ban that drug and leave the other untouched ? " the object was to basically embarrass leadership to say that we have [ marijuana legalization bills ] in front of us , and they 're going absolutely nowhere , " o'sullivan tells the huffington post . their bill would make those found in possession of small amounts of alcohol subject to fines of up to $ 500 , and anyone caught selling or distributing it faces 30 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines . ( a drug that 's been around a while shows promise as a substitute for medical marijuana , without the stoner side effects . )
