to all the new parents struggling to feed their newborn every two to three hours , imagine having to do it every hourâ€”for years . such is reality for the torti family in tennessee , whose son , owen , now 23 months , was diagnosed with the rare metabolic disorder lchad ( long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase ) as an infant . because his body does n't break down certain foods into energy , owen is at risk of his body breaking down his muscles for energy if he goes without food for more than an hour , reports abc news . " he wants to act like a normal 2-year-old and he wants to go and play and run around as long as the other 2-year-olds , " mom kayla torti says . " unfortunately , we have to have him sit down and take little breaks . he does n't know how to pace himself . " lchad , which was first diagnosed in the 1990s , is so rare it only affects one in every 100,000 newborns and was n't even on newborn screening tests until six years ago , reports wkrn nashville . to help with medical bills , two teams recently ran the ragnar relay through tennessee wearing " all in for owen " shirts and raised $ 15,000 . owen was born nine weeks premature , according to the family 's youcaring page , and has been hospitalized 12 times in 20 months , typically when a metabolic breakdown causes breathing problems and seizures . if not treated , he could slip into a coma and even die . with the constant eating , his mother says he 's developed an oral aversion to food and is on a special medical formula called lipistart , administered largely through a feeding tube . the tortis have a 25 % chance of having a second child with the same disorder . ( these parents are losing both their sons to a rare brain disease . )
