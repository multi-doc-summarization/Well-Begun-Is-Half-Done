if your local recycler starts turning away your cans and bottles in the near future , blame china . beijing has stopped accepting certain shipments of recycled plastic from the us , reports quartz . ( it reportedly will no longer welcome unwashed plastics and improperly sorted shipments ; other reports say items like coffee cup lids and pvc pipes are on the no-no list . ) this , it turns out , is a huge deal because trash has for years been one of the top american exports to china , explains the washington post . if china wo n't buy it anymore , us cities and recycling companies will be scrambling for alternatives . in fact , that 's already happening , reports oregon public broadcasting , which talks to one company that has 50 trucks ' worth of plastic sitting around thanks to canceled china orders . one sliver of hope is that china genuinely needs this stuff for its manufacturing industry , so it 's possible that business interests will pressure the government into relaxing the new " operation green fence " initiative . failing that , the us will either need to start recycling more of its own trash or find new buyers . might we suggest oslo ?
