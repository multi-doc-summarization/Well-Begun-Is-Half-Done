in bad news for the alaskan economy but good news for polar bears , the us government blocked new offshore drilling in alaska 's arctic ocean and refused to extend two existing leases for arctic drilling on friday , the new york times reports . the interior department cancelled auctions for drilling rights in the chukchi and beaufort seas while declining to extend the arctic leases of shell ( expires in 2017 ) and statoil ( expires in 2020 ) , according to npr . " in light of shell 's announcement , the amount of acreage already under lease , and current market conditions , it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the arctic in the next year and a half , " interior secretary sally jewell says in a statement . the shell announcement jewell is talking about is the oil giant 's decision last month to halt its arctic drilling after accidents , delays , and $ 7 billion with nothing to show for it , the times reports . the moves by the obama administration friday basically block drilling in the alaskan arctic for two years . it 's a decision one alaskan senator calls " stunning , " " destructive , " and " shortsighted . " but miyoko sakashita of the environmental group center for biological diversity tells the bbc it 's great news for the arctic and its wildlife . " we need to keep all the arctic oil in the ground , " she says . the us geological survey believes the arctic holds about 13 % of the world 's undiscovered oil , but the times reports offshore arctic drilling is declining—due to concerns over safety , cost , and the environment—in the us , canada , and greenland .
