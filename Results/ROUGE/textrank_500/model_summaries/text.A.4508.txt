you can temporarily take donald trump out of real estate , but you ca n't take the real estate out of donald trump . that much was clear at a singapore press conference tuesday , which took place after the president 's meeting with kim jong un and in which he touched upon the potential of north korea 's coastline . " they have great beaches , " trump noted , per the washington examiner . " you see that whenever they 're exploding their cannons into the ocean . " and that spectacular view got him to thinking : " would n't that make a great condo ? instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there . think of it from a real estate perspective , you have south korea , you have china , and they own the land in the middle , how bad is that , right ? it 's great . " the ap also reports on another post-summit activity , which it deems a " classic alpha male move " : trump showing off " the beast , " the presidential limousine , to the north korean leader . cnn shows a video clip of the two men approaching the limo , a secret service agent opening the door , and kim peering in to take a look . " we know that these men were trying to find ways to bond , in just like a personal , human way , and what 's more natural for guys [ than ] to want to check out one another 's car , " chris cuomo notes . ( here are seven complimentary things trump said about kim after the summit . )
