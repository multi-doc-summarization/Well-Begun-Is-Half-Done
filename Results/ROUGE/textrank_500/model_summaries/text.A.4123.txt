with the debut of vaping in the us in 2007 , there was hope that teens who smoked would replace old-school cigarettes with e-cigarettes , curbing tobacco use . but a new usc study in the journal pediatrics has found teens who never would have smoked regular cigarettes are experimenting with vaping . another usc study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers , per a press release . " e-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use , " says jessica barrington-trimis , lead author of both studies . while e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco , if they come pumped with nicotine ( some do n't ) , kids can get addicted . the new york times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful ; webmd adds long-term effects are unknown . using participants from usc 's children 's health study , scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015 , asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use . it 's true that rates among southern california teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 ( 19 % to 9 % ) , and slightly more in the decade after that ( a bit less than 8 % by 2014 ) . but when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments , the smoking rate jumped back up to 14 % in 2014 . and that 's got scientists worried , especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy . " e-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping , but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products , nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction , " barrington-trimis says .
