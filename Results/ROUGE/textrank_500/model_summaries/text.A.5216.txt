in a move he 's been signalling for some time , president trump on tuesday withdrew the us from the 2015 nuclear accord with iran , reports nbc news . “ this is a horrible , one-sided deal that should have never ever been made , " said the president in a televised news conference . " it did n't bring calm , it did n't bring peace , and it never will. ” trump , who accused tehran of lying about its nuclear ambitions , also said the us would be reimposing the highest level of sanctions and warned other nations not to assist iran , reports the ap . after his news conference , he signed a presidential memorandum to make the move official . the decision puts the us at odds with its european allies , which urged trump to stick with the deal , and raises the possibility of tension with russia and china , notes the new york times . “ we can not prevent an iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement , ” trump said in his remarks , adding that the agreement was " defective at its core " and an " embarrassment to me as a citizen and all citizens of the united states. ” doing away with what was considered president obama 's signature foreign policy achievement fulfills an oft-stated campaign pledge of trump 's , notes the washington post . trump cited documents revealed last week by israel suggesting that iran had a nuclear weapons program in the 1990s , something it has repeatedly denied , and lied about that fact during negotiations for the 2015 accord . " at the heart of the iran deal was a giant fiction , " trump asserted .
