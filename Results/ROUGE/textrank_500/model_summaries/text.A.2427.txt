sad news from one of america 's great newspapers : the new orleans times-picayune has announced that it will cease daily publication this fall . the paper , founded as the picayune in 1837 , will now offer print editions just three days a week , on wednesday , friday , and sunday , while continuing to offer daily reporting online at nola.com , reports the washington post . the move is expected to cost close to a third of the paper 's 150 reporters their jobs , and will leave new orleans as the biggest american city without a daily paper . analysts say the move will leave the paper 's future uncertain and—since the times-picayune was widely seen to have done an admirable job of moving its operations online—raises questions about the future of the entire newspaper industry . " a city like new orleans , with its rebuilding challenges , its violence , its rich culture , the odd mix of civic virtue and corruption , and its long-term existential risks from hurricanes and rising seas , deserves a first-class news gathering operation , " writes former times-picayune journalist john mcquaid at forbes . " one that gets the city , but also gets that news is changing . "
