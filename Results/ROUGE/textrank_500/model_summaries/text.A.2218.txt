as doctors shift away from drawing vials of blood from patients and rely on lab-on-a-chip diagnostics that identify a myriad of conditions using a single drop of blood , there 's now concern that not all of your blood is equal . a new study in the american journal of clinical pathology suggests " caution when using measurements from a single drop of fingerprick blood , " write researchers at rice 360° institute for global health : our blood can change rather dramatically from one drop to the next . researchers tested seven drops of blood from each of 10 participants and analyzed them for basic health metrics such as platelet counts and hemoglobin , and found a pretty wide range of results—so much so that they had to average the results from six to nine drops to rival the accuracy of a larger blood draw from a vein , reports the new york times . " if you ’ re going to take a fingerprick stick to get your measures , you need to be aware that you ’ re sacrificing some accuracy , " one of the researchers warns . the results have implications for startups like theranos and genalyte , which hope to diagnose diseases using only one drop . unlike theranos , however , genalyte has produced results via peer-reviewed studies on tests to find autoimmune diseases such as lupus , reports fast company . ( the theranos founder dropped out of college at 19 to start the company . )
