tiger woods may be back in the game , but he ’ s not on his game . woods suffered his worst round ever at the pga championship , struggling to 7-over-par 77 . much of his game was spent in water and on sand , with three double-bogeys and five bogeys , the ap reports . “ i 'm not down , " he said afterward . " i 'm really angry right now . " the struggle came after a strong start : after the first five holes , woods was tied for first . but double-bogeys at the 15th , 18th , and 6th holes helped leave him with the fifth-worst score . now , his pga tour season could end tomorrow ; it would be the first time he ’ d ever missed the pga cut , espn notes . ( maybe he 's still adjusting to his new caddie ? ) in front , meanwhile , was steve stricker , who ended up 7 under par with birdies at the 15th and 18th .
