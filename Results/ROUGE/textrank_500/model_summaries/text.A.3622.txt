the sec is finally trying to rein in the robots . chairman mary jo white today announced a massive initiative designed to tame high-frequency traders , the wall street journal reports . these automated trades currently make up more than half of all trading volume , yet they 've almost totally avoided direct regulatory oversight because the computers are trading on behalf of their owners , not clients . the rules white is proposing would change that , forcing high-frequency traders to register as broker dealers . white also said the sec was working on rules to prevent the computers from engaging in strategies that put the market at risk of massive swings , like the infamous flash crash . the sec also introduced plans to affect how human traders operate , bloomberg addsâ€”the agency is concerned that the stock exchanges have too many types of orders , adding complexity for no reason , and that some traders are using exchange-sold price feeds that are faster than the ones the general public relies on .
