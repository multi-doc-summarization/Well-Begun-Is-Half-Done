" people without the experience should n't be handling these types of animals . " this revolutionary statement of the obvious on venomous snakes comes to us by way of a fish and wildlife conservation commission rep in the great state of florida , where one austin hatfield might take that to heart . as myfox tampa bay reports , the 18-year-old captured a water moccasin in his girlfriend 's yard last month . a few days later , he had the reptile in a pillowcase on his bed . says a friend : " he took it out , put it on his chest and it was acting funny , and it jumped up and got him . " specifically , it bit hatfield on the mouth . " he ripped it off his face , threw it on the ground and he started swelling up immediately . we 've done a lot of stuff together . this is the one thing that scared me the most . " hatfield 's face swelled dangerously , but he 's recovering . the snake , also known as a cottonmouth , was euthanized so hatfield 's bite could be treated , adds the tampa tribune . further , florida requires a permit to possess such animals , and hatfield had no permit .
