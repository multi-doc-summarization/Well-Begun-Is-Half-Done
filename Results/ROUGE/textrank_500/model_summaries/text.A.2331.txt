scrabble players , time to rethink your game because 300 new words are coming your way , including some long-awaited gems : ok and ew , to name a few . merriam-webster released the sixth edition of " the official scrabble players dictionary " on monday , four years after the last freshening up . the company , at the behest of scrabble owner hasbro inc. , left out one possibility—rbi—after consulting competitive players who thought it potentially too contentious . there was a remote case to be made since rbi has morphed into an actual word , pronounced rib-ee . but that 's ok because , " ok. " " ok is something scrabble players have been waiting for , for a long time , " says lexicographer peter sokolowski , editor at large at merriam-webster . " basically two- and three-letter words are the lifeblood of the game . " there 's more good news in qapik—a unit of currency in azerbaijan— adding to an arsenal of 20 playable words beginning with q that do n't need a u . " every time there 's a word with q and no u , it 's a big deal , " sokolowski tells the ap . " most of these are obscure . " there are some sweet scorers now eligible for play , including bizjet—a small plane used for business and some magical vowel dumps , such as arancini , those italian balls of cooked rice . yowza is now in play , along with a word some might have thought was already allowed : zen . other newcomers sokolowski shared are aquafaba , beatdown , zomboid , twerk , sheeple , wayback , bokeh , botnet , emoji , facepalm , frowny , hivemind , puggle , and nubber .
