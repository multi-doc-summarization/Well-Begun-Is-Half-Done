what was once deemed " inconclusive " has now arrived at a conclusion , though that conclusion may be cold comfort to fans , friends , and family . early autopsy results on george michael could n't peg what caused his christmas day death , but on tuesday , a uk coroner announced the 53-year-old singer had died of natural causes , spurred by a fatty liver and " dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis " ( a clinical way of saying heart disease ) , cbs news reports . michael 's partner , fadi fawaz , had put up a bunch of tweets insinuating suicide right after his boyfriend 's death ; fawaz later said he 'd been hacked and took down the posts . a rep for michael had mentioned heart failure was the cause after the initial autopsy . per the american heart association , dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by an enlarged heart chamber that eventually affects heart contractions and keeps blood from being efficiently pumped out ; myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle . a fatty liver could have any of a variety of causes , including drinking too much , a bout with hepatitis c , being overweight , or taking certain medication . " i think his body just gave up , " michael 's former partner , kenny goss , told the sunday mirror over the weekend . goss adds that now the family can move on with making final arrangements , saying , " we just want closure , we want the funeral to happen . " fawaz , meanwhile , posted a few tweets tuesday in apparent response to the news , noting , " the truth is out ... " and " now i hope to receive some real love . "
