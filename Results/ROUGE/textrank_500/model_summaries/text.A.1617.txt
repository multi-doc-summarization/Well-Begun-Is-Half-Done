a california mother is outraged over what she claims is a racist toy her 5-year-old son received for his birthday , the washington post reports . ida lockett says she was helping her son put together a playmobil pirate ship set when she came to instructions to put a shackle around the neck of one of the dark-skinned pirates . “ it ’ s definitely racist , ” she tells cbs sacramento . “ it told my son to put a slave cuff around the black character ’ s neck and then to play with the toy. ” the boy 's aunt , who purchased the pirate ship set , posted on the playmobil facebook page that she was mortified . " would it be too much to ask for you to just create a regular old black pirate ? " she asks . playmobil issued a statement defending the toy as a portrayal of life on a 17th-century pirate ship . “ if you look at the box , you can see that the pirate figure is clearly a crew member on the pirate ship and not a captive , ” the statement reads . “ the figure was meant to represent a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context . " but not everyone was mollified by the statement : the post reports the president of the sacramento naacp is calling for the toy to be removed from shelves . in her facebook post , the boy 's aunt claims the pirate ship was the only playmobil set she could find with a black figure . ( playmobil once demanded a pastor stop crucifying toys . )
