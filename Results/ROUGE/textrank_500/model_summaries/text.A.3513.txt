for decades , the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art , tools , burials—found only after homo sapiens left africa . recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative , as are three new studies in science . together , they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in east africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region , per science news . researchers previously believed the early stone age marked by large , primitive tools ( hand axes and cleavers ) made way for the middle stone age and its smaller tools ( spearpoints and blades ) around 280,000 years ago . but stone tools found in kenya 's olorgesailie basin show hominin groups—it 's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago . " we see a smaller technology , a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes , " researcher rick potts tells npr . an expert not involved in the study says the tools are so " prepared and retouched " they suggest the middle stone age likely started even earlier . what drove it ? microscopic and chemical analyses of the region 's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions , meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt . but as the technology also coincides with the emergence of homo sapiens in africa , it 's possible that the human mind deserves credit . the tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks , too . some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away , says potts . others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away , per the conversation . ( these stone tools are also making waves . )
