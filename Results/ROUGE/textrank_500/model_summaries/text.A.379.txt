president obama 's trade agenda lives to fight another day . the senate this morning handed him the 60 votes he needed , voting 60-37 to end debate on his request for fast-track negotiating authority . it 'll vote on final passage for fast-track tomorrow , which the new york times sees as " virtually ensured " as final passage needs just 51 votes . as earlier reported , 14 democratic senators backed fast track in a late may vote , and 13 did so today . the timeline , per the hill : after the fast-track vote , the senate will vote on a package that includes trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) â€”a measure that would provide job training and other help to people who lose their jobs because of the trade deal . democrats have insisted taa be paired with the fast track ; some on the other side of the aisle oppose it . the house will then need to vote on it , and both mitch mcconnell and john boehner have pledged to make taa law . as politico puts it , today 's vote " came as democrats wavered on whether to trust " them to do so .
