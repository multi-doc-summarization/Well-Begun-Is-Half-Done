an old-school form of discipline remains popular in alabama . the education department 's office for civil rights has found that almost 19,000 children—2.5 % of the state 's students—got paddled in public schools during the 2013-2014 school year , reports al.com . boys get hit more than girls , and black children were paddled at a disproportionate rate compared to whites . it 's a long-standing ( and legal ) disciplinary tradition in the state that locals do n't seem terribly motivated to change : the national education association wants the practice banned , but the alabama education association has stayed mum—despite the fact that it 's illegal to paddle an adult in the state , per an opinion piece on al.com . unicef 's " violence against children " report does n't exactly support paddling enthusiasts , noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health , social issues , and academic problems . and many educational and child advocacy groups , including the american psychological association and the american academy of pediatrics , agree it 's ill-advised . but a 1977 supreme court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it—and in 1995 , alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so . most of the states that allow paddling ( 21 states reported it in the 2013-'14 school year ) are in the south .
