derrick deanda saw a van on its side after a rollover crash in elk grove , california , broke windows to free the father and three kids trapped inside , and then ... got billed $ 143 . " i pulled up right as it happened , " deanda recalls to cbs sacramento of the september 2015 incident . " there was a guy standing inside the van , because it was on its side , holding a 2 year-old infant . " after paramedics arrived , they briefly checked over deanda , who had a small cut from breaking the glass , checking his pulse and giving him a bottle of water . that 's why , weeks after the crash , he got a bill in the mail for a " first-responder fee . " " we ’ re obligated to provide the same level of service , the same billing , the same everything , for every patient we encounter , " explains deputy fire chief mike mclaughlin . " i asked the paramedics for a bottle of water to clean my hand off because i had a small scrape on my hand they ask me questions and they consider that an assessment on me , " deanda wrote on facebook , per the daily mail . mclaughlin says the fire department wants to " make it right " and waive the fee , but that has n't happened yet , and deanda plans to formally appeal . he also says the fee sends the wrong message : " why would i want to stop to help somebody if i ’ m going to get a bill for $ 150 ? " the family members he helped are all ok .
