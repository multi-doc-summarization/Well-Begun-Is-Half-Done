the makers of cheerios and grape nuts hope to win over health-conscious consumers by ditching genetically modified ingredients in their cereals . the problem is that food navigator read the fine print on the new boxes and found that each has fewer vitamins . with cheerios , for instance , the cereal went from providing 25 % of the daily value of vitamin b2 ( riboflavin ) to 2 % . or as a professor of crop science puts it , the cereal " went from being a major source of vitamin b2 to being almost zip . " grape nuts , meanwhile , no longer has vitamins a , d , b12 , and b2 . what 's going on ? neither general mills nor post offered an explanation , " but the reason likely has to do with the difficulty of sourcing vitamins from non-genetically modified sources , " says livescience . for example , vitamins are often produced using micro-organisms kept in fermentation tanks that are fed " feed stock " that comes from crops such as corn ; it 's not always easy to certify that the stock is also gmo-free .
