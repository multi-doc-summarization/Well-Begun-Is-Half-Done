remember that guy who started the bulletproof coffee fad , where people add butter and oil to their cups of joe in the hopes of losing weight ? well he 's at it again , this time with what the silicon valley techie calls " a disruptive technology for beverages , " reports the new york daily news . it 's called fatwater , and creator dave asprey swears it 's better than real water because it is infused with tiny droplets of fat extracted from coconut oil ( he 's patented this ) that improve both hydration and fat burning . the cloud computing pioneer calls it " biohacking , " or " taking control of the environment around you so you have control of your biology , " he says . " you are less stressed and recover better and are a nicer person . i am making it easier for people to make those little changes and feel good all the time . " not so fast , say the experts . " it is just getting crazier and crazier , " one nutritionist says . " if you ’ re thirsty , drink water ; if you ’ re hungry , eat food , " dr. marie-pierre st-onge , who researches medium chain triglycerides ( mcts ) at columbia university ’ s institute of human nutrition , tells time . asprey himself concedes that there is n't much research in this area , but he says he 's got plenty of anecdotal evidence that because mcts are digested differently than other fats , you do " get a little bump of energy . " but st-onge says he 's actually got it backward because they 're just burned off . " it 's not useful energy . " she adds that the 2 grams of fat in a bottle is n't close to enough to improve fat-burning . meanwhile taste testers at both the daily news and time were unimpressed , describing the water as tasting like " lotion , " " sweetened room water " that 's gotten dusty from sitting around , and " liquid soap . " fatwater is currently being sold in santa monica and los angeles . ( even asparagus water was a thing this summer . )
