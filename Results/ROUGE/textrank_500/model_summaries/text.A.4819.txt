civil rights advocates see this as a tale of two voters . crystal mason , who is black , was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a ballot in tarrant county , texas , in 2016 while being a felon under supervision . terri lynn rote , who is white , was sentenced to two years ’ probation and a $ 750 fine for trying to vote for president trump twice in iowa . on monday , the judge who sentenced mason turned down her request for a new trial . “ prison is a lot closer for her today , ” mason ’ s lawyer told the new york times . mason , 43 , had been sentenced to 60 months for tax fraud . she served part of her sentence and was released in 2016 . she says she didn ’ t know that being a felon meant she was ineligible to vote . her name had been purged from the voter rolls , and she was given a provisional ballot , which should have alerted her to her ineligibility , the prosecutor said . the judge had the option of sentencing mason to anything from probation to 20 years , reported the dallas morning news in march . whether a felon can vote varies by state . for example , as the new york times notes , in vermont , a person convicted of murder retains the right to vote , even while in prison . but in mississippi , a conviction for perjury is enough to void the right to vote . mason told the star-telegram that she was originally sent to jail for inflating returns and took responsibility for her actions . “ i would never do that again . i was happy enough to come home and see my daughter graduate . my son is about to graduate . why would i jeopardize that ? not to vote . ... i did n't even want to go vote. ” mason 's attorney is appealing the decision . mason 's case is juxtaposed with rote 's in an online petition calling for charges against mason to be dropped .
