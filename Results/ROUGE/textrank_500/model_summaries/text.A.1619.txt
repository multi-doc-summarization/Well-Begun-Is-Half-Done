if the internet seems a little slow to you lately , that 's because it 's in the midst of what is being called the biggest cyberattack of all time , reports the bbc . the fight is between a spam-fighting group , spamhaus , and a web-hosting company , cyberbunker , but it has grown to the point that it 's affecting the entire internet and its infrastructure . millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like netflix , and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power , people may not be able to access things like email or online banking . it all started when spamhaus , which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam , put cyberbunker on its list of spammers . cyberbunker retaliated , but its attack on spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact . one architect at a digital content provider likened it to , as the new york times puts it , using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person . the distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attacks " are essentially like nuclear bombs " that exploit the internet 's domain name system ( dns ) , says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target . " it 's so easy to cause so much damage . " and , notes the architect , this is " the largest publicly announced ddos attack in the history of the internet . " cyberbunker says spamhaus is a vigilante group " abusing [ its ] influence , " but the architect notes that cyberbunker is " just mad " that it got caught spamming . one security researcher says the only way to stop the attack is to arrest the people responsible . five cyber-police forces around the globe are investigating .
