new jersey democrat rob andrews made a surprise announcement today that he 'll be giving up his house seat as of feb. 18 to join a philadelphia law firm , reports philly.com . and while it 's big news in jersey , andrews is n't exactly a household name nationally . still , the washington post observes that he 's got a legislative track record remarkable in its own way : over 23 years , not one of the 646 pieces of legislation andrews authored has become law . all the more impressive is that no representative has introduced more bills than him in that span . sure , most bills fail in congress , but " by those numbers , andrews would be america â€™ s least successful lawmaker of the past two decades , " writes david fahrenthold . andrews , described as a " semi-liberal back-bencher , " defends himself by saying that modern lawmaking these days is done through massive pieces of legislation , not through individual bills . by his own reckoning , andrews estimates that 110 of his ideas have become law in that fashion . if he wants to eliminate the goose egg , however , maybe he can rename a post office in his final two weeks ?
