this year 's public service announcements urging people to get a flu shot might have just gotten some extra ammo : new research suggests the shots not only help ward off the flu but protect the heart as well , reports the la times . an analysis of previous studies found that 3 % of people who got the flu vaccine went on to have some kind of " cardiovascular event , " as opposed to 5 % who got a placebo , according to the study published in the journal of the american medical association . that is , those who got flu shots reduced their risk by about a third of having a heart attack . " if there are those out there who for whatever reason do n't get the flu shot or do n't feel that they need it â€¦ this is one more reason why they might help , " the lead researcher tells reuters . so what 's going on ? webmd explains a leading theory : the flu triggers an inflammatory immune response in the body , and that inflammation could spell trouble for arteries , especially ones already compromised . if the shot keeps the flu away , all that is avoided . the researchers say those who already have heart disease should be especially vigilant about getting the yearly flu vaccine .
