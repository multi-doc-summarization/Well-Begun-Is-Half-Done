president trump on sunday addressed the devastation wrought by the latest california wildfires , the hill reports . " california wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which are n't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized , " he tweeted . " it is being diverted into the pacific ocean . must also tree clear to stop fire spreading ! " but marketwatch says his tweet " befuddled experts , " noting that the state 's water supply and how it 's used is n't to blame for worsening blazes . for one , the water is n't being dumped into the pacific , and firefighters do appear to have plenty of water , per a california department of forestry and fire protection rep—but trees and brush have become more flammable due to the state 's years-long drought . " we do manage all of our rivers in california , and all the water is allocated many times over , " wildfire expert leroy westerling tells the san francisco chronicle . " so i 'm not sure what [ trump ] was recommending . … it boggles the mind . " westerling points the blame for making the fires worse at " ongoing warming and accelerated climate change . "
