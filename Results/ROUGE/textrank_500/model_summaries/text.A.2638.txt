the un 's human rights committee says ireland 's effective ban on abortion violated a woman 's human rights and must be reformed in what the guardian calls " a ground-breaking judgment that is expected to set an international precedent . " the committee responded to the case of amanda mellet , who was denied an abortion during her 21st week of pregnancy in 2011—though doctors said her fetus had a heart defect and would die in the womb or shortly after birth—as a law makes abortion illegal unless a woman 's life is at risk , per reuters . rather than continue with the pregnancy , mellet traveled to the uk for an abortion , alone and at her own expense , and returned home 12 hours later , though she was n't fully recovered , because she could n't afford to stay longer . the committee says that amounted to cruel and inhumane treatment . " many of the negative experiences she went through could have been avoided if [ she ] had not been prohibited from terminating her pregnancy in the familiar environment of her own country , " the committee says , calling on ireland to allow " effective , timely , and accessible procedures for pregnancy termination . " though " the report carries no legal power , " per the ap , ireland must compensate mellet and move to prevent similar cases under the international covenant on civil and political rights , per the guardian . ireland 's government has suggested it wo n't address the laws directly as a result of the decision—which has infuriated anti-abortion activists , per rte news—but will ask a citizens ' assembly to recommend changes .
