when erin and marianne krupa decided they wanted to start a family five years ago , they moved from north carolina to new jersey in search of a less conservative environment . little did they know they were about to hit upon a state insurance mandate from 2001 that they say specifically discriminates against same-sex couples trying to conceive : in new jersey , most women under 35 must prove infertility by having had " two years of unprotected sexual intercourse " before their insurance providers are required to cover fertility treatments , reports the new york times . soon after they visited fertility doctors , erin learned in 2013 that she is infertile due to endometriosis and benign cysts on her uterus . but their insurance provider has denied coverage of most treatments the couple has gone through , which means they 've spent nearly $ 50,000 so far in their quest to have a child . now they 're suing the state . " it 's completely discriminatory , " reproductive endocrinologist dr. jane miller tells wabc-tv . and while only two other women are joining the krupas in the lawsuit , shannon minter of the national center for lesbian rights tells the new jersey law journal that " these denials are extremely common " and " we expect to see many more [ legal challenges ] . " one of the plaintiffs ' attorneys says that the law in new jersey is especially discriminatory in its language about exposure to sperm through intercourse . new york and connecticut , for instance , require exposure but do n't specify how , while legislation in california and maryland requires infertility treatment be covered regardless of sexual orientation . as for the krupas , marianne has since gone through her own fertility treatments , but has miscarried twice . both women are still trying . ( these two common surgeries may make women more fertile . )
