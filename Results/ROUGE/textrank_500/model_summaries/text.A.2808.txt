mitch mcconnell has been calling the white house daily , and not to discuss president trump 's golf game . mcconnell has been carefully explaining—without explicitly telling trump what to do—which supreme court nominees would get faster approval before the november elections arrive and make everything dicey , insiders tell the new york times . mcconnell prefers raymond kethledge and thomas hardiman and warns that reported front-runner brett kavanaugh poses two problems : too long a paper trail from his 12 years on the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , and too much political baggage from his years as assistant to kenneth starr and staff secretary to president george w. bush . mcconnell has also told trump he could lose two senate votes ( lisa murkowski and susan collins ) with another apparent contender , amy coney barrett , who has trumpeted socially conservative views and may be more likely to overturn roe v. wade . mcconnell is also aware that with john mccain away fighting brain cancer , the gop has only 50 votes , and libertarian-leaning rand paul could be a wild card . the times describes kethledge as a " strongly conservative " midwesterner who has n't spent much time in washington , and hardiman as a " reliable conservative " who served with judge maryanne trump barry , one of trump 's sisters , on the federal appeals court in philadelphia . check out the hill to see which contenders are being pushed by other top conservatives .
