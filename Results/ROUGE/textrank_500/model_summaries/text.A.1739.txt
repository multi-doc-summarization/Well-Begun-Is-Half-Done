" i choose to go to the moon , " japanese fashion tycoon yusaka maezawa declared at an event at spacex 's california headquarters monday night . spacex founder elon musk revealed maezawa as the company 's first paying passenger on a voyage around the moon scheduled for 2023 , reports reuters . maezawa , who will become the first person to travel that far into space since the apollo 17 astronauts in 1972 , has signed up for the voyage in spacex 's still unbuilt big falcon rocket spaceship . musk , who described the 42-year-old mawzawa as " very brave , " admitted it is not " 100 % certain we can bring this to flight . " musk said the bfr launch vehicle , which he envisions carrying passengers and cargo to the moon and mars , will be ready for orbital flights in two or three years . spacex did not disclose how much maezawa is paying for the out-of-this-world trip , but he tells reuters it 's more than the $ 110 million he famously paid for a jean-michel basquiat painting . the tycoon said he would invite six to eight artists to travel with him on the spacecraft , which will loop around the moon without stopping , the bbc reports . " they will be asked to create something after they return to earth , " he said . " these masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us . " ( spacex 's earlier plan to fly two people to the moon this year has been shelved . )
