restaurant servers who give customers plastic drinking straws they have n't asked for will have to suck up a maximum penalty of a $ 1,000 fine or six months in prison under a controversial bill in california . the bill was introduced in the state assembly by majority leader ian calderon last week , and the democrat says it will eventually be amended to drop the harsh penalties , 10news reports . " the penalties are attached to the code section the bill is currently in , " he said when asked about the fines . " that will change . amendments are part of the legislative process . " the proposed ban on handing out straws without being asked will apply only to sit-down restaurants , not fast-food outlets or bars . in a tweet , calderon said the " straws upon request " bill " is ( a ) not a ban ; ( b ) should it become law , it will not make it a crime for servers to provide plastic straws . my intention is simply to raise awareness about the detrimental effects of plastic straws on our environment . " calderon , whose office noted in a press release that some 500 million plastic straws are thrown away in the us every day and that they 're one of the most common items collected in coastal cleanups , says the bill is part of wider efforts to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in waterways and the ocean , ktla reports . ( california banned single-use plastic bags in 2014 . )
