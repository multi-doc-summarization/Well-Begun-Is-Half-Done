" the 88-year-old minnesota resident has not forgotten : her testimony helped german authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people , including meisel 's mother , died , the minneapolis star tribune reports . she identified one former guard , 94-year-old johann rehbogen , as the young ss officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed . prosecutors say the men ca n't be tied to specific murders , but their work as guards made the killings possible . meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a " death march " away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors . " this process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life , " she says . the two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder , the ap reports . they deny any knowledge of killings at the camp , where thousands were starved to death or froze . prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death , shot , and killed with lethal injections . authorities say meisel and several other stutthof survivors in the us could be called as witnesses if the former guards are deemed healthy enough to stand trial .
