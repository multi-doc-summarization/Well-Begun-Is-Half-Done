apple presented its new smartphone wednesday , and nestled in with the iphone 7 's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone 's headphone jackâ€”news that was n't exactly met with universal acclaim , or much acclaim at all . chris taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch , writing for mashable that , in nearly 20 years of attending apple product launches , he 's " never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as i did wednesday . " apple marketing head phil schiller used the word " courage " to describe apple 's innovation , but that 's not how taylor sees it . " courage is marching across the edmund pettus bridge in selma in 1965 [ or ] facing down a tank in tiananmen square , " he writes . " courage , by definition , involves doing something that makes you afraid . " apparently taylor does n't think apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan . he 's got plenty of other words instead of " courage " in mind , including " hubris , " " arrogance , " " greed , " and his personal favorite , " stupidity , " which he attributes to apple for taking " one step forward , two steps back " both technologically ( " wired almost always sounds better than wireless " ) and logistically ( no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers , for example ) . meanwhile , although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack 's demise , quartz notes that apple is actually late , not early , in making this move : a handful of chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years , and some have already sent these phones , sans jacks , to market .
