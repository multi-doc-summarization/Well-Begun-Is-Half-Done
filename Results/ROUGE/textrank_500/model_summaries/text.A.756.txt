an emoluments lawsuit against president trump is moving forward after a federal judge ruled wednesday that attorneys general from maryland and washington dc have legal standing to proceed , the ap reports . according to the washington post , it 's the first time such a lawsuit has ever made it past its first legal test . two other emoluments lawsuits were tossed by a judge in new york in december , cnn reports . attorneys general karl racine and brian frosh accuse trump of violating the emoluments clause of the constitution by receiving illegal gifts from foreign governments via the trump organization . while judge peter messitte of the us district court of maryland is allowing the lawsuit to move forward , he 's limiting its scope to just the trump international hotel in dc , excluding mar-a-lago and other properties . the lawsuit accuses trump international of getting special tax concessions and having a competitive advantage over other hotels . messitte noted that foreign governments have moved their business from other dc hotels to the " president 's hotel . " he ruled that trump 's other properties are too far away to have any financial impact on maryland or dc . while messitte did not rule on the allegations themselves , he did reject an argument from the trump camp that only congress can decide if a president has violated the emoluments clause .
