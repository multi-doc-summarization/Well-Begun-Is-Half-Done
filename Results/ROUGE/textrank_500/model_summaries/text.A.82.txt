the wall street journal has revealed a list of potential running mates being vetted by hillary clinton , and it does n't include bernie sanders . possible future vice presidents currently in the early stages of vetting include sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts , labor secretary tom perez , urban development secretary julian castro , sen. tim kaine of virginia , sen. sherrod brown of ohio , sen. cory booker of new jersey , los angeles mayor eric garcetti , rep. xavier becerra of california , and rep. tim ryan of ohio . a national poll conducted by bloomberg found warren leads in popularity among clinton supporters , 35 % of whom wanted to see her as vice president . she was followed by booker , castro , and al franken . ( newt gingrich was the most popular vp choice on the gop side . ) while some sanders supporters had been hoping for a vice presidential nomination for him , sanders himself would n't be interested in the position anyway , according to a source close to him . cnn reports sanders would rather work to change the democratic party from the senate than be seen as a " sell-out " or clinton 's " partner . " that may explain the interest in warren , whose policies are close to those of sanders and who could possibly bring some of his supporters over to clinton . bustle calls her a " shiny apple to sanders ' orange . " sources close to clinton say the top priority for a running mate is someone who would be ready to step in as president , and that advisers are n't really looking at what a nominee does for clinton 's campaign in terms of demographics and geography .
