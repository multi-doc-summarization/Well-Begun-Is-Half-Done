more pieces of the puzzle are coming together as to why two men reportedly dressed as women rammed an nsa gate yesterday morning , resulting in gunfire and the death of one of the suspects . police are now speculating that the driver of the stolen ford escape may have made a wrong turn and taken a restricted exit to the agency , then panicked because there were drugs inside the car , the washington post reports . an nsa officer gave the men instructions on how to get off the campus , an nsa spokesman says , but the driver did n't listen , so barriers were erected , the ap reports ; at least one nsa officer started shooting when the car revved up to crash into a police vehicle , the agency adds . it 's not uncommon for drivers to think the off-ramp leading to the nsa security post is just a regular fort meade exit , an ex-intel officer tells the daily beast . in fact , the source notes , " a large number of immigration law violations " have been culled from the accidental trespassers who could n't come up with the proper id once they were stopped by nsa agents . the fbi confirms to the post it does n't believe this was a terrorist incident , while an unnamed law enforcement source tells the paper , " this was not a deliberate attempt to breach the security of nsa . this was not a planned attack . " ( meanwhile , the white house is having issues in putting up a jumper-proof fence . )
