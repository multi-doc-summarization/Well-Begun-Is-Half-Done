david bowie 's latest album—marking his return after a decade—seems to be living up to the anticipation . sure , it 's not 1970s bowie , but critics are loving the 66-year-old 's the next day : it " may be the greatest comeback album ever , " writes andy gill in a five-star independent review . " it ’ s certainly rare to hear a comeback effort that not only reflects an artist ’ s own best work , but stands alongside it in terms of quality . " in the telegraph , which also gives the album five stars , neil mccormick ca n't restrain himself : it 's " an absolute wonder : urgent , sharp-edged , bold , beautiful , and baffling , an intellectually stimulating , emotionally charged , musically jagged , electric bolt through his own mythos and the mixed-up , celebrity-obsessed , war-torn world of the 21st century . " if that were n't enough , the next day is " thought-provoking , strange , and filled with great songs , " writes alexis petridis in the guardian . full of " inarguable tunes , " the album 's " success rests on simple pleasures " —though the lyrics are " so dense and allusive " you may wish you had cliffs notes . " it ’ s not diamond dogs or young americans or low—get real , this isn ’ t the seventies , " writes chris roberts at the quietus . still , " it ’ s not just good , it ’ s great . "
