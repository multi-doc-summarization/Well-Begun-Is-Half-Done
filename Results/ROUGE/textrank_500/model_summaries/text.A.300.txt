no one 's going to call sparkle a work of cinematic genius : it 's a no-surprises remake about the struggles of a 1960s girl group . but if you 're a whitney houston fan , it may be meaningful : in the washington post , ann hornaday applauds the film . it " may have begun as nothing more than a tuneful , diverting nostalgia trip , but it turns out to be a surprisingly poignant swan song , " she writes . there 's an eerie element to houston 's character , who " warns against the depredations of an entertainment industry that indulges and exploits young talent just as intently as it nurtures it . " in rolling stone , peter travers calls the movie " a formula job from scene one to dead end . " still , there 's one houston song ( " his eye is on the sparrow " ) that " almost redeems " the film . " in a movie that feels fake to its core , houston is the genuine article . " during that scene , " i ’ m pretty sure there wasn ’ t a dry eye in the house , " notes sara stewart in the new york post . " if you ’ re still mourning houston ’ s death , it ’ s almost enough of a reason to go . " but remember , the movie is more of a " showcase vehicle for a new generation of young actress-hyphen-singers " than a celebration of whitney . and as for star jordin sparks , she " fails to sparkle in any way , " writes courtney shea in the globe and mail .
