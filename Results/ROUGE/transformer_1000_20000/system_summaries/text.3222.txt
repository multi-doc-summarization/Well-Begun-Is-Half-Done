the state 's attorney general says he 's looking into a " calexit " proposal that would require an amendment to the us , the new york times reports . according to the washington post , the measure was approved by gov . jerry brown and other democratic elected officials to declare the measure unconstitutional . the state is expected to vote on the november 2018 ballot , but it 's not clear whether the measure will apply to the state , or whether it 's a " donor state . " according to politico , it 's possible that the law will be repealed if the state does n't have a constitutional right to secede from the rest of the country . it 's the first time the state has voted to amend the constitution , which prohibits the state from holding immigrants beyond their borders . but the measure does n't apply to a law requiring the state to discriminate against gays and lesbians . " it 's clear the main reason for sudden interest in calexit is donald j. trump â€™ s unexpected victory in the southern states , " trump said in a statement , per the times . " this is not a matter of debate . " but the times notes that california 's secession efforts are " pretty simple , " and that it 's " unlikely that the state will be able to flout federal spending laws . "
