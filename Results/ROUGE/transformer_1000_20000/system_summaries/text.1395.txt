rick perry is taking flak for not yanking health insurance from a tea party debate , but he 's not going to buy it . " what do you tell a guy who is sick , goes into a coma and does n't have health insurance ? who pays for his coverage ? are you saying society should just let him die ? " he asked . " yeah ! " he added , per the miami herald . " this issue is about education , it 's not about immigration . these kids showed up in our state by no fault of their own , some 2-3 years of age . and they 've been in our schools , they 've prepared themselves good , they want to be contributing members of society . so it would be i think the wrong message to say somehow or another that you ca n't go to our colleges , or we 've going to punish you because of the reason the cost is so high , " he said , adding that his campaign has " the right message " on opportunities for children who were brought to the united states illegally . " we have given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves , assume responsibility for ourselves ... that 's what we really think about . "
