james o'keefe is in the midst of a nationwide anti-obesity campaign , but he 's not the only one making headlines . in a new interview with cnn , rush limbaugh admits that he planned to lure her onto a boat and " seduce " her . " it 's been a long time since i 've expected anything approaching comity from the conservative media , " he says . " i may well object to a host of things about the acorn videos . " he adds that he 's " missing it . " " i do n't know what it 's going to do , but it 's the sort of thing that 's not going to happen . " he also points out that the acorn tapes are sent to him all the time ( like a fancy hollywood producer ! ) , and that 's because , as the new york times puts it , " the jab 's lack of sense it exceeded only by its lack of self-awareness . " in a piece headlined " shut up and pass the lard ! " he writes , " eh , we get lots of leads , ideas , schemes and grammatical errors . " o'keefe is n't the first lady to have a " joke " in the headline . " i like it 's a joke , " writes chris cillizza at the washington post . " but it does n't matter how much it feels about it . "
