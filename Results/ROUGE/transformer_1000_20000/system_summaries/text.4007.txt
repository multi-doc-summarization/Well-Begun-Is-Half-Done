the democratic republic of congo says it 's " perfect storm " of population growth , sex and allowed hiv to spread through the city each year , the bbc reports . according to a new study published thursday in science , researchers used archived samples of hiv 's genetic code to find the virus 's origin in the 1920s , and found that the virus went from there to two cities in the southeastern 1920s and has infected nearly 75 million people , the guardian reports . " you can see the origin of history in the 1980s , " says the study 's lead author , per the bbc . the study , which looked at 13 cases of simian viruses and gorillas , found that 13 of those cases exist of gorillas , and oneâ€”known has a much longer history in africa , where the virus has been traced to the hiv pandemic , which is believed to be the result of a roaring sex trade . researchers say it 's possible that the hiv virus may spread the virus to humans , but it 's not clear how many people are infected with hiv , the new york times reports . in fact , the study found that more than 900 million people have died in the past year alone , with the goal being to reconstruct the virus . researchers say they 've found a correlation between the virus and hiv , which the bbc calls " the biggest breakthrough in the history of the americas . " ( another study finds that the pandemic of hiv is the first to be solved . )
