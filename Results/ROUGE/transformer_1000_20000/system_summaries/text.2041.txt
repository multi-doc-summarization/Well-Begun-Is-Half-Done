a judge on friday tossed out a $ 417 million jury award to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer in 2007 , the ap reports . according to the ap , the judge ruled that maren johnson & johnson acted with malice and the award for damages was excessive . " we will continue to defend the safety of johnson 's baby powder as we prepare for additional trials in the us , " the judge said in a statement . " this is not caused by the cosmetic-grade talc we have used in johnson . " the state 's attorney , mark robinson , said the ruling was " pleased with the ruling . " johnson 's lawyer said the company is n't commenting on the specifics of the case , but the missouri supreme court vacated a $ 72 million award to the family of an alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer at age 87 . the company said it had n't rescheduled the award , but it did n't disclose the jurisdiction of the plaintiffs . johnson , who is suing fox for failing to adequately warn consumers about the talc and ovarian cancer for three decades , has said that the powder was " proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder . " the ap notes that the missouri woman 's baby was found to be in the hospital .
