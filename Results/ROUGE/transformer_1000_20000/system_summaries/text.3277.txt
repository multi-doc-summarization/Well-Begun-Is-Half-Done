john travolta has been flying over 40 years as a pilot and i can tell you , there 's no one i 'd rather have at the controls than a qantas pilot . " this is your captain speaking - well , maybe not today , " he tells news.com.au . " but i can guarantee that the guys on the flight deck and the greater team care just as much about aircraft safety as i do . " the video opens with travolta 's new safety video , which shows him posing in a pilot 's uniform and hat , as well as captain richard de crespigny . " who better than the genuine aviation professionals who saved qf32 ? " he says . " it makes us feel like we work at mcdonald 's . " the airline says it 's " really happy with the video and we think it 's demeaning to be called the team . " qantas says it has received " positive feedback from staff and customers . " qantas is n't the only one to respond to the video . " we feel it 's really engaging , " says one flight attendant , who did n't wish to be named , " i 'm not going to go back to australia . "
