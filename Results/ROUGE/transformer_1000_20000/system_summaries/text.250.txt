" he adds that he was " heartbroken " by the ufo 's death , and that he " was a tragedy , but having run the uk government 's project i promise we do n't go around killing ufo hunters . " the telegraph reports that spiers died from natural causes , but the foreign commonwealth office says it is investigating the cause of the death . " we have no evidence of foul play , " bates says . " we are investigating the possibility that there is no evidence that there was a link between ufos and the likelihood that it was poisoned . " spiers , who had visited to give a series of speeches and interviews about his investigations , says he has no plans to investigate the death . " i do n't have his written permission , " he says .
