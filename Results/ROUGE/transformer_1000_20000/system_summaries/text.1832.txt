" the new york times reports that russia 's foreign minister called the move a " farce , " noting that the us " has no decision on whether moscow will dispatch forces . " the ap reports that ukraine 's military says it 's mobilizing troops around the country , but that does n't mean much of its troops will have to do so . the ap notes that the ukrainian military is still trying to rein the rebels out of control , but it 's not clear whether the russian forces were involved in the move , which the ap sees as an attempt to distract the regime 's presence in the middle east .
