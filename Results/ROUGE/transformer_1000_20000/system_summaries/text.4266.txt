president trump 's 2005 tax return is the most expensive tax return ever , and the white house announced wednesday that it would save more than $ 20 billion a year , the new york times reports . " a lot of families go through hell over the death tax , " trump said during a presidential run , per the washington post . the tax , which is expected to be released in march , will be phased out by the trump family and several of the people he has chosen for his administration . the plan , which includes a tax break for america 's richest people , has been a major goal for republican lawmakers , including john mccain , ted cruz , bernie sanders , and ted cruz . the times notes that the tax cuts are expected to rise by the end of the year , with the times noting that the plan could be under the law with what it calls a " <unk> " tax overhaul , which would allow the tax cut to be used by the federal government . the times reports that while the plan does n't apply to the tax rate , the tax increases would be a huge increase in the deficit , with a 40 % increase over the next decade . that would mean the deficit would rise to $ 3.6 billion , while trump 's proposed tax rate would be up to 3.6 % . but the times points out that it 's not the first time trump 's return to the estate tax bracket , which he sees as a " hard time reconciling his populist agenda .
