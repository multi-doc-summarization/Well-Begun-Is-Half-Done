" it 's not clear what the show was talking about , but it does n't matter how much it was , " writes chris cillizza at the washington post , which rounds up reactions from weiner 's 2004 puerto rican senate race , which was drummed up by the likes of john mccain and george hw bush , writes dylan byers at the daily beast .
