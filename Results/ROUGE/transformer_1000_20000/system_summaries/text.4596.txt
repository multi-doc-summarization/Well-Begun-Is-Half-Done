if you 're looking for a link between brain size and iq , you 're not alone , according to a new study . researchers from britain 's university of vienna crunched data on 88 studies involving 8,000 participants , and found that the size of the brain 's iq exists , the guardian reports . " although a certain association is observable , brain volume appears to be of only little practical relevance , " says lead researcher jakob pietschnig . " there 's no evidence to suggest it 's a causal one . instead , it 's the structure of your brain that is a larger role in determining how smart you are . " in the study , published in the journal nature neuroscience , researchers found that more research is needed to be replicated on brain size . " the results suggest that strong and positive correlation between brain development and brain size is not warranted to interpret this association in the context of human cognitive evolution and species differences in brain size as an isomorphic proxy for human intelligence differences , " a researcher says in a press release . " the effects of brain volume have been overestimated in the literature , but remains robust even when accounting for different types of brain dissemination . " the findings , published wednesday in plos one , were published by the british medical association , which says the findings are based on " molecular markers , " the bbc reports . the study also found that people who are more likely to commit more than 150 years of brain cancer than their chronological age group . ( another study found that those who have been recruited to be more successful . )
