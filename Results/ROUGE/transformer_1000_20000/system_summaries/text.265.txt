a federal appeals court upheld key parts of texas ' strict anti-abortion law requiring doctors to meet all of the building requirements , the ap reports . the 5th circuit court of appeals ruled tuesday that hospital-like structural requirements for abortion clinics can go into effect unless it violates the state 's constitution . the law , which owners of small clinics say would be allowed to meet hospital-level operating standards , requires millions of miles away from an abortion provider . the court said that the law is a " large fraction " of women who are still within driving distance of the procedure , and that the court disagreed . " not since before roe v. wade has a law or court decision had the potential to devastate access to reproductive health care on such a scale , " the center for reproductive rights said in a statement tuesday . " the decision was made by the state to do so . " the court also said it would " burden the abortion provider " on its own , but that it would not be able to obtain privileges at hospitals . the aclu , meanwhile , says the decision " did not impose an undue burden on the women , " and that " it would be impossible for them to do that .
