" it 's very exciting to see how this virus is going to be , " says study co-author dr. robert <unk> , who says the study is based on a molecular database of more than 100 genes that have been found to be linked to opioids . the study also found that those who lived in parts of europe and asia were more likely to die prematurely than those who were n't at the time .
