pink is on the cover of people magazine 's beauty issue , and her 15-month-old son , sage jameson , says she was chosen after editors saw photos of the singer with her best friends . " i feel more beautiful and i â€™ ve decided that for the whole week that the magazine is out no one is allowed to look me directly in my room , " she tells the new york daily news . " i immediately turned to whoever was in the room and said , ' did you ever think this was as good as it gets ? ' " she says . " i think , honestly , it was jameson and willow that secured me a little bit more attention . " she adds that she 's wondering if in 20 years if she 's gon na be upset about his first cover , but that 's not a beauty contest , she says . pink , who has n't been seen since she was born , has a long history of mental illness , including cancer , heart disease , and diabetes . she says she has no plans to do so . " i do n't know what to do about it , but i do know what i 'm going to do , and that 's what i want to do to do . "
