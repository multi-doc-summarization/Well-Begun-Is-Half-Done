" if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign , that is a really big deal , " he tweeted . " if true , all time biggest political scandal ! " the new york times reports that trump 's name was an " american academic who teaches in britain and who made contact with trump foreign policy advisers george papadopoulos and carter page . " reports are there was indeed one fbi representative implanted , for political purposes , and long before the phony russia hoax became a 'hot ' fake news story . " the times notes that the fbi has n't commented on the documents , but it 's not clear whether trump will be able to get access to documents related to the fbi 's investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election . trump 's april 2016 conversation with an australian diplomat was infiltrated by robert mueller 's russia investigation , which has led to a probe of the fbi and the trump dossier . the times reports the fbi is investigating the fbi informant 's identity , which is believed to be an fbi source .
