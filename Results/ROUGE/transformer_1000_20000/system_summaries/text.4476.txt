britain sent a royal air force plane to crisis-hit cyprus today , and it 's not clear how many will be able to sniff out the glitch , the bbc reports . " we 're determined to do everything we can to minimise the impact of the cyprus banking crisis on our people , " says the spokesman . " britain does not use the euro , having stuck with the pound as its national currency . " the british government reaffirmed tuesday that it would fully refund any military or government personnel whose cyprus bank accounts were subject to an eu levy that was part of the bailout deal , reuters reports . the imf says it will consider further shipments if required , and the imf is n't prepared to do so . the eu says the imf will refund the bush-era cargo flight , which is currently funded by britain as a strategic foothold in the mediterranean , with around 3,000 british troops based at two military bases in cyprus , which are used by the strategic petroleum industry . the imf , meanwhile , says the deal is determined by the government to refund military personnel and their families with emergency loans .
