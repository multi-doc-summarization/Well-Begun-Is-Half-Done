george w. bush is in the midst of a deal with president obama that would increase the " risk of terrorist activity , " the new york times reports . " you read his stuff , it 's like reading obama 's campaign , " he said , according to the washington post . " i do n't know what to do about it . " he added that he 's " not going to mention a " cretin " and " a poster child for everything that is anathema to conservative republicans . " but he 's not the only one who wants to do that . " i think it 's going to be a long shot , " graham said , per politico . " i 'm going to have to do something about it . " but the white house says it 's looking into the possibility that the obama administration will do more to rein in the military . " i have no idea what it will do , " says graham , who has been in the running for president since 1985 . " it 's a matter of time . it 's time to say goodbye to the american people and the world . " graham , a democrat on the house intelligence committee , says he is " delighted " by the decision . " i 've had a lot to say about it , but i do know it was a week ago , and i think i have a good idea . "
