karl stefanovic , the australian tv personality who played a role in the double standards of his female colleagues , has died at the age of 45 , the guardian reports . " i 've worn the same suit on air for a year except for a couple of times because of circumstance to make a point , " he says . " but women , they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up . they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them . " " i 'm judged on my interviews , my sense of humour on how i do my job , basically . whereas women are quite often judged on what they 're wearing or how their hair is ... that 's [ what i wanted to test , " stefanovic says in a statement , per the sydney morning herald . the show , which airs monday , says it does n't have a " secret that there is a huge gender gap in general . " it 's not the first time women have been wearing the same knock-off suit for the first year , but it 's still not clear how many people will be able to identify themselves as victims . " we 're going to try a little experiment , " says stefanovic , whose research is published in the journal of clinical sciences . " we are trying to figure out why this happened . "
