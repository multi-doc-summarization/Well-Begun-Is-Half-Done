the north dakota state senate today passed a measure that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy , the ap reports . the bill , which passed by gov . jack dalrymple , would make it a class a misdemeanor punishable by up to 10 years in prison if convicted . the measure would require a physician to determine whether there 's a detectable abnormality or to select the sex of an unborn child , but it would also require a fetus to survive outside the womb , according to the new york times . " the time has come to choose life , " says berry , r-fargo 's mother . " i do n't know how to do this . " the bill was approved by the senate on friday , and the state 's legislative director of the national institutes of health tells the times that the issue is " not a matter of debate , " and that 's why the bill is n't going away anytime soon . " it 's not the first time i 've ever heard of it , " he says . " i 've never seen anything like this before . " the state senate voted against it last week , but the state voted against the bill anyway , the washington post reports . in a statement released friday , the governor said the state had no intention of adopting abortions because of a fetus that has a genetic defect like down syndrome . " i think it 's a good thing to do , " she said , adding that the bill 's effect on the abortion is " the strongest abortion restriction in the nation . "
