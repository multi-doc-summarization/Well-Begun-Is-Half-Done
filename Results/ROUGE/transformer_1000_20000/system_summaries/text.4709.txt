german chancellor angela merkel says it 's " not a right for anyone to go anywhere at any time according to his or her whim , " the ap reports . " why ? because migration is such a huge economic , social , and health issue , affecting nearly every country , " she said in a statement , per the ap . " no . " the us , meanwhile , says more than 80 % of the world 's migrants have been killed in a safe and orderly fashion . the agreement failed to " support a 'compact ' or process " that could " impose " safe , orderly and regular migration . " the trump administration said it would not allow the 193 nations to participate in the accord , but the ap notes that the un 's international organization for migration estimates there are 1 billion migrants in the southern hemisphere over the next decade . the us has n't commented on the proposal , but it 's not clear how many nations will be able to reach the agreement , which includes the us and estonia . the un says the goal is to create a new right to migrate .
