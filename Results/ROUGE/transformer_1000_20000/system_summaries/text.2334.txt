the world 's smallest da vinci painting features 240 shades of gray , as well as the pixel pixel pixel x pixels . that 's the conclusion of a study published this month in plos one . researchers say the painting is a plastic whose surface is visualized using an atomic force microscope and a pixel pixel <unk> , and the overall image is seen on the lisa 's forehead and hands . " the spatial confinement of these reactions provides the precision required to generate complex chemical images like the molecular concentrations on the nanoscale , " lead author jennifer curtis says in a press release . " by tuning the temperature , our team manipulated chemical reactions to chemical variations in the molecular <unk> . " the study , published in the journal of technology , is based on a study in georgia tech , which found that the beam is more active than one billion times larger than the louvre 's . the study is expected to be compatible with the new process , reports the new york times , which notes that the width of a human hair can be applied to the louvre , but it 's not clear whether the painting will be able to use the same technology as the louvre . the study 's coauthor says that while it does n't appear to be a big deal , it would have a " significant impact " on the painting , which would require a " lab on a chip , " per a release . ( the painting features a 3d model . )
