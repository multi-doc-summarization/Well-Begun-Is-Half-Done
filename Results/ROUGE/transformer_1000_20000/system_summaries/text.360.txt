ben carson will go to jordan friday to visit a refugee camp in northern jordan , reports the new york times . " i find when you have firsthand knowledge of things as opposed to secondhand , it makes a much stronger impression , " carson said in a surprise visit to jordan , where he will visit a clinic and a hospital . carson , who has been in the state since october , has been criticized for comparing security concerns to refugees , including increasing access to foreign policy . carson has been trying to clarify that claim , but aides say he has no plans to visit syrian refugees . " i do n't think that 's what it 's going to happen , " says carson , whose campaign has been ongoing since the paris terror attacks . carson , meanwhile , says he has " to have in place screening mechanisms that allow us to determine who the mad dogs are , quite frankly . " he says that while he does n't know what he 's talking about , " we do n't have a conversation about this issue , " he adds , noting that he 's not interested in foreign policy issues . " i think it 's a great idea , but it 's not a matter of time . "
