iran 's supreme leader on wednesday urged europe to do more to back the 2015 nuclear deal after president trump refused to re-certify the pact . " we welcome this approach but it is not enough that they only tell him not to tear up the deal , " ayatollah ali khamenei said , per the ap . " the european governments have underlined the nuclear deal 's issue and condemned the u.s. president 's remarks , " he said . " if the us tears up the rants , we will shred it . " khamenei did n't call on lawmakers to do so . " i don â€™ t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the nuclear accord , " khamenei said . " i will not distract us from america 's nuclear program . " the supreme leader also called on allies in europe to " stand against " the deal . " trump 's comments come after last week announced that he would not spend time responding to iran 's nuclear deal , which provided tehran with sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on iran . " the us stressed their backing for the deal and condemned trump ... we welcomed this , but it 's not enough to ask trump not to rip up the agreement . europe needs to stand against practical measures ( taken ) by america , " the head of the office of the iranian supreme leader , ayatollah ali takfiri , said in a statement wednesday . he added that the us will " shred it . " " i do n't believe iran will be angry because the us is committed to a unilateral attack on the country . " he added
