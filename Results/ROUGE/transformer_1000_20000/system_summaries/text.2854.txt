president trump 's son-in-law , jared kushner , has been allowed to remain in his white house security clearance , sources tell the new york times . the sources say the white house has blamed the delay in kushner 's role in the investigation into the 2016 campaign and the transition to the fbi . kushner , who is now finished with all ongoing inquiries from the trump presidency , was stripped of his interim clearance in february amid an overhaul of his application . " a year ago , he has continued this complete cooperation , providing a large number of documents and sitting for hours of interviews with congressional committees , " says one of the first to voluntarily cooperate with the office of special counsel robert mueller . " the sources appear to be trying to complete parts of their inquiry , and the new information comes as the mueller investigation continues . " the kushner team believes he has now sat for an interview last year , " a spokesman for mueller says in a statement . " the fact that jared kushner 's troubles were compounded at least in part because some of the matters under investigation relate to his role during the campaign and related topics . " the fbi says it is investigating kushner 's security clearances , including contacts with russians , as well as events that occurred in the early months of the election .
