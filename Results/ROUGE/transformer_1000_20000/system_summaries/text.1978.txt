a new report from the national climate assessment finds that climate change is already affecting the northeast and midwest , and it warns that it could raise temperatures by up to 10 degrees over the next decade . " these changes are part of the pattern of global climate change , which is primarily driven by human activity , " says the study 's lead author . " it gives us a road map for climate change . and the road is much bumpier if we continue along a higher emissions hazard . " the report , published friday by a federal advisory panel , calls the " hottest year on record in the lower 48 states . " the new york times reports that the report 's authors say the report is " unambiguous evidence " that earth is warming up in the middle of the year . " this could help restart a national conversation about climate change in the future , " a professor at the university of rochester says in a press release . the report says that while the report does n't seem to contradict the fact that it 's a pattern of " localized " steps to drive down emissions . " we can start with strict weather events , " he says , adding that " we need to get feedback . "
