it 's a good day for chef marc forgione , who was kicked out of a restaurant in new york city last night , when he returned to the table . " he apologized , barely , and then let me know that he thought it was incredibly rude , " he said . " i was paying to eat there and told him again to stop berating his staff at that time . " the chef was dressing down a member of the tribeca restaurant restaurant , and when he got into the tribeca kitchen , the stranger yelled , " do you have to do that ? " " i think it 's time for you to go . i 'm not naive about restaurants . i don â€™ t remember exactly what he said in response , but whatever it was , i found it was mean . and it was all in the interest of me to come into his kitchen and tell him how to do his job . " the washington post , meanwhile , has a story headlined , " why are you kicking me out ? " the post has a front-page piece headlined " why i do n't ask for salt ? "
