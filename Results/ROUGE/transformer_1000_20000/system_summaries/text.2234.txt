" every week i want to be number one , and we fight like hell to get there . and it ’ s tough right now . i see what our challenges are . but we ’ re going to fix our problems . " nbc news : " the show in trouble ? is your job in trouble , " says a journalism professor . " you , either , it 's hard not to sell you . " but it does n't look like it , either . " i do n't think it was a joke , but i think it would be a good night for the people to come out of the theater , and i ’ m trying to sell it to the people who have been there for a long time . " on the latter side of the sunday show , the editor of meet the press says he was " not just trying to get a job . " " this is not going to happen . it 's going to be a long way . it 's time to go .
