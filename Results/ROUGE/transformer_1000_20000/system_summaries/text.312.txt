nancy pelosi and charles schumer are gearing up for a showdown over the border wall , reports the washington post . " it happens to be like a manhood issue for the president , building a wall , and i ’ m not interested in that , " she said , per politico . " i think if the election were today we would win the majority … wave or tsunami , we ’ ll see in three weeks . " she added that she would n't trade with president trump for his border wall . " in fact , it ’ s probably the worst way to protect the border . " pelosi , meanwhile , is pushing back on the issue , saying that the house is looking forward to an expected december vote , reports politico . the house minority leader says the white house has " no choice " to support the wall , but that does n't mean much of the house will be able to pass the $ 5 billion bill , which would require the senate to pass it during the oct. 1 start of the fiscal year . the senate is expected to vote next year , and democrats are expected to push forward a plan that would require a lame-duck period of time . the house has already said that it 's time to get rid of the border , though it 's not clear whether the wall will be built . the senate will vote on dec. 7 .
