a new study out of the university of virginia finds that 98 % of us will sign away on the terms of service , the guardian reports . that 's the conclusion of the study , published wednesday in plos one , published in the journal of neuroscience . the researchers looked at 399 participants , who were asked to read the terms , " gotcha " and " <unk> , " and found that those who did n't read the results were more inclined to cheat on their findings . the study looked at a number of subjects who were n't at the same time , and found the subjects were more likely to read their recollections . " i think that 's a good thing , " says one of the researchers . " it 's not a good idea . " but the study was n't swayed by the study 's findings . " it was a very pessimistic indicator of how many gotcha people were doing , " one researcher says . " they were just trying to figure out what they were doing . " the study found that people who signed up for the site tended to see how much the legalese was given , and the researchers did n't seem to agree with the findings . " if the user does not yet have children , this agreement will be the first step forward , " the lead researcher says , adding that the findings could be applied to the public , the new york times reports .
