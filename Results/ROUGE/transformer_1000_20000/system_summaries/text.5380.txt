the texas state board of education approved a resolution today calling on publishers to treat all religions with balance and accuracy , the austin american-statesman reports . " what we 're trying to do is prohibit and send a clear message to the publishers that [ the bias ] should not happen in the future , " says board member mavis knight , president of the texas freedom network . " this is a cosmetic exercise , " she says . " it is hard not to conclude that the members who voted for this resolution were solely interested in playing on fear and bigotry in order to pit christians against muslims . " the resolution was politically motivated , but it was unclear what immediate effect the policy will have on publishers . the resolution , which was spearheaded by the dubai royal family in 2003 , is expected to be voted in favor of a " pro-islamic/anti-christian bias " in the resolution . the resolution also includes a series of textbooks , <unk> , and <unk> , among other things . the board also said it would " ensure that biases are taken , " and that it would have to be reversed . the resolution was <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
