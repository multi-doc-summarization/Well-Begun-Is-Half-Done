" we are not going to tolerate this , " he says . " we do n't know what to do about it . " the board says it is investigating whether the victims were patients or children , and that it 's not clear whether the charges will be filed . " this is not a case of sexual misconduct , " rook says in a statement . " it is a very difficult case . " in a letter to the ap , <unk> says he 's " disappointed " by the findings , which he sees as an " isolated incident . " " i do n't think that 's what i did , but i did n't think i was going to be a part of my life . " he adds that the investigation into alleged sexual assaults is ongoing . " i 've never seen anything like this in my life , and i 've had a lot of things to do with it . i 've got a problem with it . i 've been thinking about it . i 'm not a problem . i 'm going to do that .
