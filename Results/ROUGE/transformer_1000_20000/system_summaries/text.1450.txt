newt gingrich 's debate performance in the national security policy focus is getting a lot of laughs , but pundits are panning the debate over the weekend . here 's what they 're saying : the pundits are divided over whether gingrich 's refusal to back away from his belief that we shouldn ’ t throw out all 11 million people illegally could come back to bite him in a party that is opposed to anything that looks or sounds like amnesty , " writes peggy noonan in the washington post . " the difference ? his rise to the top of the polls afforded him lots of laughs . " " it ’ s not a good night for gingrich , " she writes . " he ’ s got to say that he doesn ’ t have a problem with that . " but it 's not just a matter of debate , writes ed morrissey at hot air . it 's " a <unk> , <unk> spar with the moderators , who have a <unk> deficit of more than a quarter of the hundreds of millions of dollars a year , " he writes . " it 's time to see whether the debate is going to be a bad night . "
