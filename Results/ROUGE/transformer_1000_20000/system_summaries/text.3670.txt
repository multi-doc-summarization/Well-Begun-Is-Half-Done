" frankly , i 'm not going to get whipped up over whether a woman wants to give birth in a hospital or a pile of leaves , but i do find the premise of having an entire film crew around to document and televise the experience does somewhat undercut the whole world , " writes eli lehrer of the new york times . " it 's certainly a head-turning tv hook . " the new series , published in the reality show , offers a detailed breakdown of what 's going on in the wild : " the wild will document the emotional and psychological of people attempting to fix their lives . " " it ’ s not a good idea , but it doesn ’ t matter how much time it is , " he writes . " but it is n't just a matter of time . " the network also says it 's " so lame " that it 's been " <unk> " for years , and it 's not the first time the couple 's birth in the us . " we 've got a lot of people who have chosen to do this , and we ’ ve got to know that we ’ re going to be a little bit more careful , " says the network . " we ’ ll never have to do that . "
