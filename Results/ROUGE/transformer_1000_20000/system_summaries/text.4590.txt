" the 25-year-old running the leadoff leg , felt his fibula with 200 meters to go . he had to finish or the united states would have been out of the event . " it might be a lot more than that , " mitchell said , according to the ap . the fibula is the smaller of the two bones that make up the lower leg , the other being the tibia . unlike the fibula , it is possible to run 200 meters on a broken fibula ? very difficult , but not impossible . " the fibula was non-weight-bearing . " it is the tibia who will close the london games , " says mitchell , who has a history of mental illness . he says he made it around the track in more than 46 seconds—a time that placed him in a tie for fifth out of eight runners—is extremely impressive feat considering that he had a complete break in his left leg .
