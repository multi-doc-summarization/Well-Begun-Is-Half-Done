the navy says it has its first female seal candidate to be a seal officer in the pipeline , but the navy has n't confirmed the news . the seal officer , an independent website for the naval special warfare command , tells the washington post that women can now serve in combat positions . " they are the first candidates that have made it this far in the process , " lt. cmdr . mark walton says in a statement . " whoever these unnamed trailblazers are , the path ahead for them wo n't be easy . to become a seal or swcc , they 'll need to make it through basic underwater demolition/seal . " he says the navy declined to comment on the issue , but it 's not clear whether it will take months or so . " it would be premature to speculate as to when we will see the first woman in the navy 's history , " walton says . " it 's different for everyone , " he adds , noting that " the point of them becoming a special operator is not a part of the equation . " the post notes that while the navy is still investigating , it 's unclear how many women will be eligible for the pipeline .
