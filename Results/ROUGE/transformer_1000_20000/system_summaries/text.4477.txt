a new study out of the american heart association suggests that caffeine consumption does n't contribute to heart failure , reports cbs news . researchers at the university of california san francisco surveyed more than 6,000 people over a 12-month period , and found that those who drank some sort of product every day were more likely to die prematurely . " we may unnecessarily be consumption of items like chocolate , coffee and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits , " says the lead researcher . " given our recent work demonstrating that extra heartbeats can be dangerous , this finding is especially relevant . " in a press release , researchers found that the risk of atrial fibrillation was not tied to the heart , which was associated with a congenital heart condition . the study , published in january , found that caffeine had been linked to heart attacks , but that was n't the case . " it was not a matter of time , " the study 's lead author says . " it 's not a good thing to do , but it 's a good day for doctors to lighten up . " the researchers say that while the study reinforces the point of causation , they do n't know what 's going on , but they do posit a possible link between the heart 's cardiac rhythm and heart rhythm . " if you do n't have a heart attack , you should n't have to worry about it , " one researcher says .
