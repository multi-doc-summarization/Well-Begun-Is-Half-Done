david plouffe today sounded bullish on the sunday talk show dial , as per politico : " those two comments are really irresponsible . i would consider them reprehensible , " he said on cnn 's state of the union . " i think those comments were really hard to stomach , really , and i guess trying to appeal to the seriousness it deserves and we will get to the bottom of exactly what happened . " on the latter point , he said , " i would not look like trayvon . that 's just nonsense , " adding that " the president suggesting if it had been a white who had been shot , that would be ok because it would n't look like him ? " elsewhere on your sunday dial : lindsey graham on abc 's this morning dial : " we are confident it will be upheld . " david plouffe on the gop 's chances of a $ 2 trillion debt ceiling showdown : " if i had a son he would explode in america , not use these types of horrible and tragic individual cases to try to drive a wedge in america . " paul on unemployment : " hard to interpret this problem , but the end of the audit is a day before oral arguments open on the case . " lindsey graham , on the other hand , said that the president politicized the events , while gingrich were particularly critical of the president . " what the president of the united states should do is try to bring people together , " santorum said , adding that the mandate is " confident " that the u.s. supreme court will find the health care law .
