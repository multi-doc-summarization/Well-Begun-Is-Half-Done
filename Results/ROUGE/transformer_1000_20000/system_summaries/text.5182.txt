enrique peña nieto says mexico will not pay for any wall , but he says it wo n't pay for it . " if mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall , then it would be better to cancel the upcoming visit to the united states and find a dignified position for mexico. , " he says , per the washington post . " i think the least we can do in these conditions would be not to show up , cancel the meeting . " trump , who says he wants mexico to put a single peso towards the end of the year , says he 's considering " time and time again . " peña nieto , who is expected to meet with trump in the wake of trump 's executive order , says the wall street journal that he has no plans to do so . " i regret and reject the decision of the us to build the border wall , " trump says in a statement . he says the us has " sustained criticism for failing to come up with a decisive strategy to deal with trump 's combative policies . " he adds that the wall is n't going to happen , but that does n't mean the wall wo n't happen , and that 's not the case , he says . " it does n't matter how much it 's going to do . "
