" " gee , it sounds like making sure that rape accusations are taken seriously , and to the full extent of the law , in all cases , is a pretty important issue , for progressives ! " he says , adding that he does n't believe the women who are accusing assange of rape will serve time for that rape . " if we factor in the rapes that go unreported , only 6 % of rapists ever serve time . " she adds that she 's " appalled " by the accusations , but " i do n't think that 's what i 'm going to do , " she says . " i 've never seen anything like that , but i 've got to do that . " she also notes that she has no plans to file a lawsuit against assange , who says he has no intention of prosecuting the victim . " i think it 's a hoax , but it 's going to be a hoax . "
