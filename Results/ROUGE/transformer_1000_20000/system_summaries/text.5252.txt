the small southern utah town of hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend , the ap reports . the sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for barista 's restaurant , and owner stephen ward says he woke up friday and decided the bull would look better without the weenie . " i told them i am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints . i do n't know what a weenie on a bull is supposed to look like , " ward tells the spectrum newspaper . " and oh my god ! it 's beautiful . " ward says the sign was approved by the planning department and ward went through the proper channels , but the city council to revoke ward 's business license . " the dimensions of certain parts of the animal do n't seem to be built the same way as in the plan that came to us . " it did n't even look ( right ) , it was in the shape of a cone , " he says . " but the conflict had been running high between ward and the local community just north of the arizona border . "
