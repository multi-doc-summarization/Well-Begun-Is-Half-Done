" i think there 's a lot more to do with it , " one of the researchers says . " i do n't know how to do it . " but the cta spokesperson says the procedure is a " proactive , protective measure " that would allow riders to check for explosive compounds . the cta says there 's no indication that it will be able to use the explosives to make sure they 're safe .
