tesla ceo martin tripp 's twitter account has been taken down by a former tesla employee who says he was pushed out of tesla 's operating system , the new york times reports . according to business insider , the former tesla engineer was working for tesla as an engineer in 2010 when the company filed a lawsuit alleging discrimination against him in order to silence his claims of poor part quality and waste at the hands of tesla ceo cristina balan . the lawsuit claims tesla is storing waste or scrap in open parking lots and trucks at the gigafactory , rather than temperature-controlled warehouses . tripp 's lawyer says the photos are " no longer available , " and the company says it 's investigating the allegations . tripp , who says tesla 's gigafactory took dangerous manufacturing shortcuts , says he has no intention of sending them to the company . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " he says . " i do n't know what to do . " tesla says it has n't commented on the photos , but it 's not clear whether tripp will be disciplined . " if you do n't have a lawyer , you should have to do that , " tripp says . " it 's a matter of time . " tesla , for its part , says it will " vigorously investigate the allegations . "
