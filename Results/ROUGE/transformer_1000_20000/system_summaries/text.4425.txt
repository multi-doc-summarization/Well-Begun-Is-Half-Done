if you 're wondering why the catcher in the rye is such a canonical novel , you 're not going to be floored by the fact that he 's not a fan of it . " i read it because everyone else in school was reading it but thought it was without any literary merit whatsoever , " he tells the new york daily news . " now , looking back , i find that it is totally silly . " he adds that the catcher used the word " <unk> " to describe the " eerie imitation " and " <unk> , " and that it 's a " brilliant " one that 's been used to describe it as a " <unk> " <unk> , and that the " <unk> " label has been used for decades . " it 's not the first time that we have been told all our lives that we can only call ourselves well-read once we 've read the great books . " he also notes that " we have a lot of people on the internet , " but that does n't mean he 's a racist or hateful person , and he does n't think he 's racist , he says , adding , " i do n't know what i 'm talking about , but i 'm going to do that . "
