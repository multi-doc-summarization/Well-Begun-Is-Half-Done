" for the past three years , on 9/11 , i 've been standing on the ground , " he says . " i was in awe because he is well over the age to be standing on a bridge in 100-degree weather , but he did and all for four people and the other thousands that he does n't even know . " he adds that he remembers the picture and automatically knew it was the same man .
