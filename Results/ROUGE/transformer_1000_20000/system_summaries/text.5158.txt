a new report from the united states sentencing commission finds that only 3 % of us drug defendants were sentenced to more than three times as many years in prison , the new york times reports . " prosecutors can say , ‘ take these 10 years or , if you get a trial and are convicted , you ’ re going to look at life , ' " says an attorney who specializes in criminal justice issues at human rights watch . " that ’ s a pretty amazing power that unfortunately they are more than willing to wield . " the report 's authors describe the likelihood that the drug was used to offer defendants smaller sentences as part of a deal . " if you can get someone to acknowledge guilt without the burden and expense of a trial , it doesn ’ t take the time and resources , and it increases the notches on your belt of how many convictions you ’ ve been perpetrated , " he says . " you don ’ t have the cost of it. ” the report also found that the justice department is investigating a possible drug possession that could have been sent to prison for 17 years .
