a new study finds that saudi arabia 's top university of virginia is lending credence to the notion that the brain that tries to remember the active mental context within which those memories were first learned , reports the los angeles times . " once the exam is done , we gleefully evacuate our brain of all this hard-won learning that ’ no longer needed . within days , we can barely remember the subject matter , let alone the details . at such moments , it ’ s as if we ’ ve forgotten on purpose . it might then come as a surprise to learn that until recently , there was little scientific evidence that people could have any deliberate influence on their rates of forgetting , " says the study 's author . " but in the essence , they instructed people to deliberately remember or forget words they ’ d just learned . and they then spied on the brain to see what happened next . " the study , published in the journal of wikileaks , finds that the study is " striking , and makes intuitive sense , since it 's also the key to forgetting is an instrument . "
