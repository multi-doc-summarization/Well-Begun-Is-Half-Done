john boehner 's two-step strategy : the house voted early sunday to approve a government shutdown , reports the new york times . the measure , which would require the senate to pass a bill that would give the house a victory , would have to wait until the last minute , notes the washington post . it would be the first government shutdown in 17 years , but the white house is expected to announce that it would require congress to pass the bill , reports politico . it 's not clear whether the bill will be repealed , but it 's still unclear whether the shutdown will be a big deal , notes politico . " it 's a matter of time , " says a spokesman for the house intelligence committee . " we have no idea how much we can do this . " meanwhile , house republicans are divided on the shutdown , and they 've been trying to rein it in . " i think there 's a lot of chatter about this , " said one gop senator . " i do n't want to stand down from a fight too soon . "
