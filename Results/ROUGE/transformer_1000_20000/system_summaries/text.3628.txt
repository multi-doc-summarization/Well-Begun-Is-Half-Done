rudy giuliani says he 's " being targeted not because i committed a crime , but because the 'deep state ' liberals want to silence me and pressure me to testify against my good friend president donald j . trump , a longtime associate of president trump 's team , says mueller 's office has told them it is " still studying " the latest letter , cnn reports . " i figured we would n't hear until after the manafort trial , but we ( still ) have n't , " giuliani says . " he said mueller 's team could be considering a report without talking to the president , or issuing a subpoena , which would mean the battle over a subpoena would occur during the midterm elections . " " robert mueller is coming for me , " stone tells the guardian . " roger stone 's latest pitch to his email list of supporters boils down to this : right now because , literally , i am the next guy to get indicted . " giuliani , who was convicted of and his former personal lawyer , says he has to figure they 're planning something . " i ’ m next on the crooked special prosecutor ’ s hit list because i ’ ve advised donald trump for the past 39 years , " he says , adding that he does n't know what trump 's lawyers have offered or waiting for him to donate to his defense fund .
