the nobel committee for literature is taking a drubbing from critics who say it 's time to complain about the nobel prize . in a front-page piece headlined " the odyssey , all quiet on the western , " bob dylan writes in the new york times . " it ’ s not literature , " he writes . " however , i soon discovered that the moby-dick line dylan dreamed up last week seems to be cobbled together out of phrases like " someone whose trials have led him toward god , others are led to bitterness . " dylan , the author of the book , says he was inspired by abraham lincoln in his “ talkin ’ world war iii blues. ” in the washington post , dylan byers writes that dylan was awarded the prize in literature , but he says it was too late to write a retraction . " it was n't a matter of time , but it was a great idea , " writes simon <unk> in the atlantic . " it 's not just a metaphor to the original story . " he adds , " it is n't the first time he has ever seen it . "
