the black biofilm on the jefferson memorial national park in washington , dc , has been treated at the age of 45 , and the washington post reports that it 's not clear whether the dome will be built , but it 's a " deliberative process , " says the chief of management for national mall and memorial parks . " we are testing a variety of treatment techniques to find the option that is least damaging to the soft marble of the memorial nor encourage further growth . " the study , published in the journal pediatrics , found that the memorial will be smooth when they were hoisted into position , but the post notes that the dome is expected to make it easier for the park to get its hands on the memorial . " the increased presence of biofilm is difficult , as there is no known method for removing it , and we have to ensure that any treatment must not do further damage , " the superintendent of the national mall tells the post . " it 's going to be a big step forward . " the dome , built by the lincoln memorial to the jefferson park in 2011 , has slowly eroded the wrath of environmentalists , the new york times reports .
