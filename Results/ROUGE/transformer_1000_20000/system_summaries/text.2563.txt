a new study out of imperial college london finds that puberty is still one of the great mysteries in biology , reports the guardian . the study , published in the journal nature , found that 29 healthy men were given either an injection of kisspeptin or a placebo . the results were based on data from the national institute for health research , and the university of bristol researchers found that those who lack a functioning kisspeptin system fail to achieve puberty . " we now know that , almost literally , â€˜ puberty with a kiss ' ! it started with a gyrus , " the lead researcher says , per the guardian . the study was published in plos one , and it 's not clear how much the hormones was associated with sexual and emotional love , but the researchers say the results could be replicated in the brain 's medial prefrontal cortex . the study 's lead author says the findings are " very troubling , " but " it 's important to see how the brain functions , " he says . " but it does n't necessarily mean that the neuronal firing will be a response to the question of whether or not he will be able to play a role in the study . " researchers say they have no evidence of a link between the brain and the brain , but they do posit a correlation between the testes and the amygdala , which can lead to better moods , the guardian reports . ( another study found that viagra may not be the first to cheat . )
