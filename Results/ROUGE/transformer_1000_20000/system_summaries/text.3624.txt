netflix has announced a new program for all employees , and the company is aiming to make it more competitive with its unlimited and paternity leave program , the wall street journal reports . " we want employees to have the flexibility and confidence to balance the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or the accompanying responsibility , " netflix says in a statement . " with this in mind , today we ’ re introducing an unlimited leave policy for new moms and dads that allows them to take off as much time as they want during the first year after a child 's birth or adoption . " the company says parents can come back to the office either part or full time , then go back out as needed . " it ’ s smart . companies aren ’ t going to get the best out of folks when they ’ re super stressed out and have their minds at home , " says a spokesperson . " this is a pretty landmark perk , with the company showing both current and potential employees how much it cares about . " but the journal points out that netflix 's policy update could be a big step forward for the first time in three years .
