the french satirical magazine published cartoons of the prophet mohammad on wednesday , and it 's a doozy of a scathing critique of the french film star brigitte <unk> . " we have indeed decided as a precautionary measure to close our premises , embassies , cultural centers , and schools , " the acting head of egypt 's freedom and justice party said in a statement , per the guardian . " we reject and condemn the cartoons that defames the sacred according to people 's beliefs , " he added . " this is not the first time the world has made such a mockery of the muslim community . " france 's foreign minister , meanwhile , called the cartoons " an act of liberation " and said it would close its embassies and schools in 20 countries on the same longitude of the country 's capital . " it 's not a matter of contention , but it does n't matter how much of it will be , " a foreign ministry rep said . " it is not clear what it will do . " the guardian reports that the magazine 's editor , pier giorgio armani , said that " you must n't mock " under the headline " untouchable 2 . " but the guardian notes that the twitterverse 's criticism of the film has been largely ignored by the french government , which has been criticized for its crackdown on gays and lesbians .
