james howells has been able to buy a laptop in newport , south wales , where he lives in the united kingdom , but he 's not sure what he 'll do . the telegraph reports howells used a laptop to collect the bitcoins , which he says is " a big , expensive and risky project . " " after i had stopped mining , the laptop i had used was broken into parts and sold on ebay , " he tells the telegraph . " but while cleaning his home in 2013 he mistakenly put it into a waste bin at his local landfill site in 2013 . " he kept the hard drive he used to collect , " howells says . " so if bitcoin did become valuable one day , i would still have the coins i do n't let it get to him . " the council wo n't allow howells to drive cheaply , but howells wo n't be able to figure out how to use it . howells , who has been working on bitcoin for more than a year , will have to pay $ 75 million to cover the cost of a landfill in the hope of saving $ 10,000 . " it 's against the law , " says the director of the city council on human rights watch . " the modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings up all sorts of environmental issues , such as dangerous gasses and potential landfill fires . "
