the lacey act of the environmental investigation agency is out , and it 's a doozy of a story out of india . npr reports that guitar ceo henry juszkiewicz says he 's " on the ground in madagascar getting a tour to understand whether there were opportunities for 'good wood ' sourcing , and in the end after seeing the piece , " does not require any 'certification ' at all per se . " he says the raids at two nashville facilities and one in memphis recalled a similar raid in november . " i used 'illegally ' when i meant 'legally ' in talking about the trip to madagascar , " she says . " i really wanted to be clear : the objective of that trip 's organizers was to look into whether they could possibly source illegally from that country . " the justice department says it 's investigating the allegations , but it 's not clear whether the government intentionally misled the public about it . " we have been implicated in wrongdoing and we have n't been charged with anything , " says johnson . " our business has been injured to millions of dollars . and we do n't even have a court we can go to and say , 'look , it ’ s not the first time that i ’ ve done this until i was listening to the piece .
