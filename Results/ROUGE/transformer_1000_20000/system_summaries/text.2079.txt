taco bell 's recipe for seasoned beef is getting a lot more attention . the lawsuit filed by taco bell , maker of the " bogus and filled with completely inaccurate facts " that goes into detail about the percentage of ingredients in the recipe , like how it contains 88 % of the meat and the rest is " inspected , just like the quality beef you would buy in a supermarket and prepare in your home . " the lawsuit claims the beef is actually only only 36 % fake , but it does n't appear to be true , reports the los angeles times . " our beef is 100 % loggers , " creed president and chief concept officer greg creed says in a statement . " there is no basis in fact or reality for this suit and we will vigorously defend the quality of our products from frivolous and misleading claims such as this . " creed is n't buying it , either : " we 're cooking with a proprietary recipe to give our seasoned beef flavor and texture , just because we do n't want to do it . "
