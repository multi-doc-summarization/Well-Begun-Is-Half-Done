the queen bee is getting a lot more attention after a car boot in the back of a <unk> coast national park in haverfordwest , england , got stuck in its boot . " i had to go to dinner so another took up the last few hundred bees to leave the boot but then a gust of wind blew it off , " says tom moses , a ranger at the university of texas . " i then left the cardboard box and carefully brushed them into there as quickly as possible as i was aware it was a big swarm in the middle of the car , " he says . " it was like , 'oh my god , you know , ' i 'm gon na die . ' " burns , who says the car 's owner returned and drove off without the help of the queen , says the queen fled to the boot . " it 's just a matter of time , and it 's very hard to imagine what happened to the queen . " the swarm was around 20,000 square miles , and the hive was destroyed by a 13-foot <unk> swarm of 20,000 bees so far this year , when it was too late for the queen to be trapped in the swarm . " it is very difficult to see how it happened , but it 's going to be very difficult , " the director says . " we 've never seen anything like this before , but we 've got a lot of people who have lost their lives . "
