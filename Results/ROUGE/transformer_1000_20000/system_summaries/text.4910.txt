the american journal of physics is out with a doozy of a new analysis of lopped 4 minutes off that estimate . that 's the conclusion of a study published this month in pnas , which found that the time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer a planet . the upshot : it 's the kind of paper we love , " says david jackson , a physicist at dickinson college in pennsylvania . " that 's what makes this so much fun to think about , " he says . " the gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of isaac newton 's law of gravity and a common but very important type of motion . " it 's not clear how much latitude the planet 's orbit will be , but it 's still unclear how long it will be . the new research , published in reality , suggests that the force pulling you toward the center is proportional to the distance from the center , you zip back and forth through earth exactly as a weight on a spring bobs up or down or a pendulum swings back into the tunnel . it 's also possible that the side of the earth 's orbit is more conducive to the cyclical world than it did in the first place . " if you 're looking at a tunnel through the center of earth 's ultraviolet light , it 's going to be more accurate than you 've ever seen before . "
