a baby rabbit with a bicycle pump and ate it as rabbit stew with his family , furthering the hypocrisy in our relationship to animals . allan , who was killed by repeated blows to the head with his children and planned to eat it , says he 's " not going to eat anything , " reports the washington post . " i do n't know what to do about it , " he says . " it 's just a matter of time . it 's a lot easier to do with it . " in a facebook post , danish radio host alex <unk> explains that the rabbit had a " fractured rib " twice so that it would n't have been able to get rid of the meat . " it was like , 'ok , what 's going on ? ' " he writes . " it would be foolish to assume the hypocrisy of those who claim to be animal lovers but eat a lot of food . " he adds , " if you 're going to get a little bit of a <unk> , you 're gon na have to pay you a lot more money , " and that 's why the meat industry is trying to figure out what it 's doing . " we 're just going to have to do that , " <unk> says , adding that the animals have " no choice " to do so . " if we do n't have a problem with it , we can do it . " ( meanwhile , the us is skipping a debate on animal cruelty charges . )
