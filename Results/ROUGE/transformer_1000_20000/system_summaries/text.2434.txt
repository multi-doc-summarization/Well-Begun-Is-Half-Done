grace and i have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the tribeca film festival film festival shootings , but that 's not the case . in a statement released by the centers for disease control and prevention , robert de niro calls it " very personal to me and my family and i want there to be a discussion , which is why we will be screening vaxxed. . " he says he 's " not personally endorsing the film , nor am i only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue . " " i do n't know what it is , but i think it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined , " the statement continues . " we have no idea what was going on , but it was not a matter of time . " the trailer for the film was founded , i have a child with autism , " de niro says . " it 's not my anti-vaccination film . it 's a terrible idea . " the film 's director says the film " has no evidence of a link between the anti-vaccination movement and the sanctity of life " and that " there 's a lot of evidence that i 've never seen anything like this before . " the director of the sierra film center tells the new york daily news that the film has been " a bit more empowered than any other person who has ever cared about . "
