hillary clinton 's list of 50 most powerful people in washington , dc , is n't exactly the kind of thing she 's talking about . " it 's just the idea that hillary is a force to be reckoned with , and she is still very relevant among americans , " she tells the new york times . " i think something ’ s going to happen . " she adds that she 's not sure what she 's going to do , but she 's definitely going to have to do that . " she says she 's looking forward to having a " cordial and productive " conversation with the white house , and that she moderated the " texts from hillary " in which she said she 'd " never heard of the word . " " it ’ s a tumblr that pairs a photo of her with your sunglasses , " smith says . " it was like most internet sensations , the <unk> . ' " but the washington post notes that it 's not the first time obama has been talking about the texts , but it does n't appear to have been a dud . " we have you seen how fierce hillary is in this picture ? " asks one user . " if you 're trying to read your job , you know , it 's a big question . "
