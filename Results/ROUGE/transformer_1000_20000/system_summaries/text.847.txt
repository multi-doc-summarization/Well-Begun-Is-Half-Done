comcast is offering the browns a full refund for the first two years of service , but it 's not the only one to do so . comcast 's wife , lisa brown , tried to fix the name herself , but she did n't like it . " we have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened . we are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again , " she says in a statement picked up by wired . " it 's no secret that employees sometimes feel their customers are jerks . but i ’ ve never seen one put it in writing . until now . " comcast , who says she was never rude , says the company is investigating the matter . " i am sorry to the people who have been trying to pull a practical joke on a consumer advocate , " he says , adding that the company 's emails were " impolite " to cancel an account , and that it " could have been that person was upset because i didn ’ t take the offer . " but the cable company says it does n't have the authority to do the right thing , and it does have a hard time explaining why it is n't appropriate for a family audience to terminate the name . " we 've spoken to our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable name change , " the company says . the browns , who have had a disagreement with comcast over the weekend , say they want comcast to file a complaint against the company .
