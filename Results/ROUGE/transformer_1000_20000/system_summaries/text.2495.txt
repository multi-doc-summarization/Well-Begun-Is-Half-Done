" after more than 250 years a wild bison had been spotted again in germany and all the authorities could think to do is shoot it , " he says . " it 's just a matter of time . " according to der tagesspiegel , the bison are known to be " vulnerable " and " half of poland , where the animal is a national symbol , would have to be declared a danger zone , " says heinrich <unk> , who warns that the bison could have been killed in order to protect the population from extinction . " i think it 's time to tell the story of the bison , but there 's a lot of unknowns about the bison . " but " it does n't matter how much the bison were hoping for , but it 's going to be very easy to see if the wolves were shot in the ocean . " so why do n't the bison do it ? the bison have been running around the uj≈õcie warty national park on the german-polish border for some time now , and it 's not clear how many bison are on the list . " we 've got a very good idea of how to swim to the bison and kill a calf . " ( meanwhile , wolves have been killing humans . )
