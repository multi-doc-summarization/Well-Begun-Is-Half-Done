a new report by the federal government finds that the government has abdicated and failed to control the government 's responsibilities , the new york times reports . the report , published today by sen. james webb , calls the report " specific and misleading , " noting that the scale of the problems in iraq and afghanistan is " meant to serve , or if it can not be supported and maintained . " in a statement , webb said the report was " badly needed , " but " should be a part of the public debate on the cost of war . " " these contractors ' deaths and injuries should not be ignored , " the report said . the report also accuses the government of " driving beyond the default mechanism , driven by considerations other than whether they provide the best solution , and without consideration for the resources needed to manage them . " it 's not the first time the report has been released , but it 's still not clear how many contractors will be able to do so , the times notes . but the report 's authors say that while the report does n't jibe with the fact that the report is accurate , it does n't have the authority to do the right thing .
