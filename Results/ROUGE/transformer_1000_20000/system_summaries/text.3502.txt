the mars rover will be on the verge of landing the mars surface , and it 's going to have to do so , reports the new york times . it 's the first time it has ever seen before , but it 's not yet clear how much latitude it will be , but the european space agency says it 's looking into the possibility that the rover was safely on the ground . " that is not inconceivable , especially as odyssey can not turn itself toward curiosity , it will not necessarily mean that the curiosity had come to a quick , unfortunate demise , " says a nasa astronomer . " if a full day passes without hearing from the rover , then the result will be confirmation and cheering in the control room . " the spacecraft will have to talk directly to earth , notes the christian science monitor , which notes that if the spacecraft is able to get to the bottom of it , it wo n't hear anything . " if it turns out that it would be an interplanetary communications glitch , " writes matt wolfram at engadget .
