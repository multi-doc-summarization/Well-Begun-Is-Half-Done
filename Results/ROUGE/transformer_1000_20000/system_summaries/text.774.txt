if you 're looking for a sperm magnet , you may be able to control your magnetic field , according to a new study . researchers at the university of twente in the netherlands found that the robot " is completely fabricated in the lab , " the bbc reports . " we have built a biologically inspired micro-robot that looks like a sperm cell , " researcher sarthak misra tells the bbc . " it 's the simple robots swim forward and steered it forward . " the study was published in the journal applied physics letters , will be useful in medical and manufacturing applications . the researchers say the robot could be used to create a magnetic field in the future . " the flapping giant is forced in different directions when the device is placed into a moving field , " misra says . the researchers , who studied the width of the magnetic field cells and found that they could steer the wafer with some metallic precision . the study also found that robots are moving on to better understand how much the robot can cover several times its body 's length . the study , which looked at the interplay of magnetic field technology , found that it 's not clear how many robots are capable of developing a magnetic tail . the study 's lead author says the findings could be applied only if they 're able to achieve a fixed point . ( another recent study found that sperm use could be useful for future research . )
