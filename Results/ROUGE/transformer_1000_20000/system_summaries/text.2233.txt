a new study suggests that the moon is a mystery , but it 's a doozy . researchers at cornell university found that enceladus has a warm ocean on enceladus 's icy crust , which is believed to be the smallest ever discovered outside of earth 's oceans , reports the los angeles times . the researchers found that the ocean 's geysers are fed up with the silica <unk> . " we think that the temperature at least in some part of the ocean must be higher than 190 degrees fahrenheit , " says lead researcher jonathan lunine . " if you could swim a little bit further from the really hot part then it could be . " in the journal nature , hsu 's team found that it was n't a dead hunk of rock , but he was n't involved in the new research , reports discovery news . the scientists say they 've figured out how to explain the moon 's geysers at the bottom of enceladus ' ocean , but they 've found evidence that hsu 's ring might be made if the moon was hot , reports nature . it 's not clear how long the rocks were going on , but the theory is that the silica dissolved in the seawater 's crust , and it 's possible the ocean could only have a liquid ocean . " it 's very strong that there is a hot environment at the base of earth , perhaps like those where we believe life began on earth , " hsu says . " it is yet another discovery in nature . "
