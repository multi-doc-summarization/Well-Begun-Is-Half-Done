air france and germany 's two largest airlines on wednesday canceled flights to tel aviv because of safety concerns , the ap reports . the terminal is empty at ben gurion international airport a day after the us federal aviation administration imposed a 24-hour restriction on flights after a hamas rocket landed in the airport . " the european aviation safety agency late tuesday said it would " monitor the situation and advise on any update as the situation develops , " the ap quotes a british airways rep as saying . the faa says it has n't canceled any of its twice-a-day tel aviv flights and had no immediate plans to do so . cnn reports that it 's expected to issue a new statement later this week , saying it 's not clear whether israel will fly to israel if it thought it was unsafe , adding that " each airline draws its own conclusion . " but the ap notes that the us plans to suspend flights to and from tel aviv to the airport tomorrow . the us says it will take weeks to finalize the ban , and the us is continuing to investigate .
