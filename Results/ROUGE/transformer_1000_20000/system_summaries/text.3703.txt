if you 're looking for a <unk> peacock , you 're not alone . the toronto star reports that the city has set out traps for two weeks , including a parody twitter account . " she was right there ! and she was ninja-still . it looked like a log , " one user tells the cbc , which notes that the two escaped from their pen at the high park zoo in may . the traps were set to be seen at high park on june 5 , and the cbc reports that it 's not clear how many people are going to eat , but it 's unclear if the zoo will be able to figure out how to do so . " the escape led to the nicknames bonnie and clyde , " a zoo rep says . " we 're not going to be a monster . " but the cbc notes that a search party planned for the next morning , there was no sign of the peacock , which is believed to be the largest ever found in the world . according to news.com.au , there 's a lot of unknowns about the escape , including the fact that there 's been a dearth of flammable material that can be seen in the past few weeks . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " says a zoo spokesperson . " i do n't think it would happen . "
