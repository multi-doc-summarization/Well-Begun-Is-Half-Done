the new york museum has apologized for the " fire in my belly , a work in progress , " but it 's not the first time a video has surfaced showing ants crawling over a crucifix . david wojnarowicz , who died in 1992 at the age of 87 , was banned from a smithsonian museum in new york city on saturday , cnn reports . " i think that in the artistic community , directors , are tremendously insensitive to christians , they respond by claiming victim status and i find it appalling , " she says . " someone who did n't see it , called it in , put pressure and they pulled it . if you pull one piece how do you know another would n't be pulled . that 's censorship . " the museum has always defended freedom of expression and continues to oppose censorship . " we can not afford to take hard civil liberties for granted and need to remain vigilant and protect artistic freedom . " the video is currently displayed in the lobby and can be viewed free of charge . the museum 's director , lisa phillips , says the video was removed from a museum after the incident . " it was a bad decision , poor judgment , " he says in a statement . the museum says it will review the video .
