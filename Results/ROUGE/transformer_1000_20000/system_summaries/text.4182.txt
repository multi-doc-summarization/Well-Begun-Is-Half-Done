apple 's ios chief , scott forstall , is a software company , and it 's a frying pan by ceo tim cook , the wall street journal reports . " everything we do at apple is aimed at making our products the best in the world . we know that you expect that from us , and we will keep working until lives up to the same incredibly high level , " forstall said in a statement . " this is the kind of volatile yet critical environment that needs team players , not mandarins . i suspect that ’ s why cook ’ s tossed ios x . " he added that he would n't " sign the document , " but that the company is still trying to figure out how to fix the problem . the journal notes that forstall 's experiences with jobs , independent self-regulating units , concentrating on one aspect of a software or hardware system . the journal 's sources say that while apple has n't been able to do so , it 's not clear whether it will be the best design mind for the user interface , but it 's still unclear how much the company will react .
