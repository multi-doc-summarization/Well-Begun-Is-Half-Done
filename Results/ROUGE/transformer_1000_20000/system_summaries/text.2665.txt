julian assange says he 's " concerned at the beginning over the egyptian revolution : whether we just saw a changing of the chairs and the maintenance of the same power structure , " reports rt . " if we look at our work over the last 12 moths , think about that . all these stories that have come out actually happened in the world , before people didn ’ t know about it . so what is it that we ’ re seeing genuine social unrest or are we seeing some kind of orchestrated and if so , who do you think is behind all this ? " he continues , " there is genuine change in some parts of the middle east . i mean egypt is a clear case . " the new york times , meanwhile , reports that facebook is not even the most important and calls on people not to believe that the information they receive from the media is all that is happening . " we only released secret , classified material . the really embarrassing stuff wasn ’ t in our collection to release . but it is still out . "
