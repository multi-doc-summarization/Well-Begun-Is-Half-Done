president obama 's speech on the democratic national convention is getting a lot of laughs , but it 's a doozy of a <unk> , writes chris cillizza at the washington post . " the faction that now dominates the republican party does n't see it that way . they think government is the enemy and compromise is weakness . one of the main reasons america should re-elect president obama is that he is still committed to cooperation , " he writes . clinton 's speech , he writes , is a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> deficit <unk> deficit , and a <unk> deficit . " clinton is n't the only one to do that , but she 's got a lot more support from conservatives , writes dylan matthews at the new york times . " it 's time to say that this is a good thing to do . " he adds , " i do n't think that 's what i 'm going to do . " but " i 'm not going to be a president . " " i 've never seen a president , i 've got to say , 'that 's a great day , ' " he says . " i think it 's going to happen . "
