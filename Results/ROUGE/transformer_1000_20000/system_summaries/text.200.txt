the remains of the brazilian football legend who died in 1983 have been interred in a cemetery in rio de janeiro , the bbc reports . manuel dos santos , the best player of the world cupâ€“winning team , was born on october 28 , 1955 , and 1966 , when he shared the golden boot . " i am not knowing where he is . it 's very upsetting , " he says . " we have information that the body was exhumed but there is no certainty that he 's buried . " garrincha 's cousin , rosangela <unk> , tells the new york times that he was buried in the same place 10 years ago . " my father did not deserve this , " santos says . the remains were removed from the <unk> cemetery in mage , brazil , where the skeleton was found . " it was just a matter of time , and it was a great day for the world to see him . " the bbc notes that garrincha 's bones were removed to be placed in a niche demographic , including the greek goddess of the italian , and the roman catholic church where the exhumation was commemorated . " it is the first time i 've ever longed to be a long time , but i 've never seen anything like this before , " says santos , who has been studying for more than a century . " i 've always had a lot of bones , and i 've had a very good time , " she says , adding that the remains are " a lot more complicated than the exhumation . "
