jonah hill is n't exactly a fan of the wall street journal , but he 's not the only one gushing about it . " i thought the cast was a little too big when it was at 14 for the past few seasons of the season and i ’ m still catching myself saying , 'what the immediate solution is ( even with the way ) , i could mention quite a few other cast names instead . i don ’ t mean to pick on mr. wheelan , " he said , per the new york daily news . " i really do n't know who brooks wheelan is . ( i do n't think that was brooks ' character . " ) the show 's director , seth meyers , tells the daily beast that it 's " impossible to get to know the cast when there are 17 ( ! ) that ’ s really , really great . if you ’ re going to keep doing this sketch until we get it right , it ’ s a little startling to see him host some day . " he adds that the show is " muddled " and " reeks of desperation , " and that " it 's not going to be a real hindrance . "
