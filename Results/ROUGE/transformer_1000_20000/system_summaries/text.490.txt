a new study finds that there 's no evidence of wheat that was not seen in mainland britain for another 2,000 years , the bbc reports . researchers found that wheat larson , a molecular archaeologist at the university of warwick , had been digging into the site off the isle of wheat island in 1999 . " we sort of got the lunch spot of this workshop 8,000 years ago , " geochemist robin allaby tells the bbc . " it was a very big surprise . " the dna fragments from the underwater site were found in the balkans , and it 's not clear how many years of research will be conducted . " the study , published in plos one , found that the deposits came from 8,000-year-old sediment cores from bouldnor cliff to <unk> . " it 's a big surprise , " allaby says . " i think it would be a big difference . " he adds that the findings suggest that britain 's agriculture minister did n't have the authority to do so . " this is the first time we 've ever seen a cow , " he says , adding that the discovery could be the result of a " collaborative effort . "
