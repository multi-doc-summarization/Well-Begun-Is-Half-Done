it 's been a rough year for the first time since the antarctic ice crisis began , and now researchers are trying to figure out what 's going on , reports the new york times . in a study published wednesday in nature , researchers found that antarctica 's ice sheet had a <unk> increase since 2012 , when the last such assessment was undertaken . " we ca n't say when it started , " says lead researcher andrew shepherd , who led the study . " we did n't collect measurements in the sea back then , " he says . the study , published wednesday , found that the ice sheet was more than 200 billion miles from its base , and that 's about half a degree warmer than the last few years .
