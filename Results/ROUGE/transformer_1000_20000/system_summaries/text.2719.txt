the supreme court ruled today that farmers could not use monsanto 's patented genetically altered roundup to create new seeds without paying the company more than $ 84,000 , the ap reports . " we recognize that inventions are becoming ever more prevalent , complex and diverse , " she said . " or it might be a necessary but incidental step in using the item for another . " the ruling came after a federal judge ruled that the seeds are resistant to the herbicide roundup , the new york times reports . " our holding today is limited . addressing the situation before us , rather than every one involving a self-replicating product , " says the court 's ruling . the decision was narrow , however , because monsanto 's attorney argued that the patent was unconstitutional because it would n't apply to the way it had used the beans to feed them to his own products . " under the patent doctrine , bowman could consume the beans he purchased from the grain elevator , " he says . " it would have been too clever for his own good . mr. bowman â€™ s main argument was that a doctrine called patent exhaustion allowed him to do what he liked with products he had obtained legally .
