the head of the senate intelligence committee says the cia improperly searched a stand-alone computer network established for congress as part of its investigation into allegations of cia abuse in a bush-era detention and interrogation program . " we were n't trying to block anything , " sen. dianne feinstein tells nbc news . " the matter is being dealt with in an appropriate way , being looked at by the right authorities , and the facts will come out , " he says . " but let me assure you the cia was in no way on [ the committee ] or the senate . " the california democrat said the cia searched the panel 's computers , possibly violating the law . the cia provided the computers to congressional staffers in a secure room at its headquarters so that the committee could review millions of pages of top secret documents , the ap reports . at issue is whether the cia violated an agreement made with the committee about monitoring the network 's use of cia computers . " i have grave concerns that the cia 's search may well have violated the fourth amendment of the constitution , " she says . the cia just went and searched the committee this past january , calling it the matter a " defining moment " for the oversight of the intelligence committee .
