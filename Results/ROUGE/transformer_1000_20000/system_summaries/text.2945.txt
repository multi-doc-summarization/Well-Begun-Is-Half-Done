the university of new haven , conn. , says it is more inclusive to all students on the front lines for free speech at yale , the washington post reports . " increasingly , it seems , they have become places of color , " the yale lecturer wrote in a letter to the school 's first black dean . " i have no idea what to do . " the email , which was sent to yale last year , was signed by nearly 70 faculty members , including faculty growth in fields with race and ethnicity , echoed at the same time . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " says a yale senior prof . " this is not a matter of trivial behavior . " the ap reports that the email was made public in october , when the school announced it would stop teaching at the helm of the college , and the school says it will review its own policy . " we have no doubt that this decision will be made , but we will not allow this to be a part of the broader community , " it says in a statement , per the post . " it is a violation of the principle of fairness , and it will not be easy to do that . "
