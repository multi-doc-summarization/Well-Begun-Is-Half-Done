the fbi is investigating james comey 's testimony in the wake of the election , and the new york times reports that the fbi 's investigation into the clintons has widened its investigation into clinton 's emails . in a letter to congressional investigators , comey said that the clintons had been trying to redirect their focus to the clintons , and that they were " not going to make everybody think for the next three or four days . " that contrasts with the fact that comey did n't have the authority to do so . " i do n't think that 's what i do , " he said . " i think it 's time to do that . " he added , " i 've never seen anything like this before . " but he added that it 's not clear whether comey 's emails were faked . " the clintons have not been identified , but they have no evidence of any wrongdoing , " comey said in a statement . " they are not allowed to be disciplined . " the fbi has n't commented on the report , but it says it 's investigating whether it will be a " showdown " if it continues to reverberate on capitol hill . meanwhile , the washington post takes a closer look at comey 's handling of her email server controversy : " it 's a matter of time , " says the editorial . " it is clear that there 's a lot of reaction you ’ d see , but i don ’ t know what it ’ s going to happen . "
