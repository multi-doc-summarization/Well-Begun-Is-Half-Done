it 's been a rough week for alabama 's heisman trophy finalist native derrick henry , who 's vying to be the nfl 's first openly gay player to run back . the new york times reports that henry has been working for the scouting academy since 1981 , when he decided to convince the team to do so . " if you want him to stop on a dime , make guys miss and create on his own if the blocking breaks down , he ’ s not your guy , " hatman says . " it ’ s a fun kid to watch . " he says he 's not sure what he 'll do . " i think it 's going to be a little more reliant on scheme and his blocking [ than ] other backs to be at his most effective , " he tells cbs news . but he says it 's time for henry to go to college , where he 's currently serving a 15-year sentence for his team , which he sees as " one of the biggest comebacks in the target world . " he adds that he has no plans to do anything to improve his career , and that he hopes to keep his career quiet .
