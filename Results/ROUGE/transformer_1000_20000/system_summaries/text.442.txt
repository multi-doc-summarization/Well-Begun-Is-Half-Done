marco rubio says he will not vote for the bill he helped write in the benghazi attack , but the senate is expected to vote against it . " if those amendments don ’ t pass , then i think we ’ ve got a bill that isn ’ t going to become law , " he said , per politico . " so the answer is . " he added that the bill is " wasting our time , " adding that it 's " hard to tell if rubio really disagrees with the substance of the legislation approved by the committee , " and that they do n't give overwhelming discretion to the department of homeland security . " rubio , meanwhile , says the bill will " strengthen the border security parts of this bill so that they can not pass without the changes , " reports the washington post , which notes that it will be a " extraordinary turn of events " in the senate . " i think it ’ s good to speak with you , " rubio said , adding that if the bill does n't pass , it would require " high-risk " amendments to the bill , and that it would make it unacceptable to rubio . the bill would require the senate to pass the bill because it wouldn ’ t vote for his own bill ? if anything , it ’ ll do it again .
