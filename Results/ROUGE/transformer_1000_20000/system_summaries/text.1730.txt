the city of san francisco is getting a lot of flak over its handling of facebook 's " facebook 15 . " that 's what the restaurant industry says has happened in san francisco , where employees have access to high-end restaurants with pizza ovens , pastries , and ice cream , the new york times reports . " we wanted to make sure businesses were there successful , " says the city 's transportation director , who says the village is " committed to the public . " the city says it 's looking into whether the city plans to save themselves after the apocalypse , but it 's not clear how many employees will be able to opt out of the building , which is currently being staffed by thousands of workers . the village 's biggest employer , google , says it is looking into a ride-sharing office , and it 's a safe place to do the same . " it 's the culmination of a 2014 agreement with the social network , which says tenants are n't allowed to eat in restaurants , but they do n't have the authority to do so . facebook , for its part , says that it 's working to fix the problem , and that it does n't require a tenant to pay for the privilege of the catering industry . but the times notes that facebook has n't taken a fair share of its own , and a rep for google says the company is " not going to be a good place .
