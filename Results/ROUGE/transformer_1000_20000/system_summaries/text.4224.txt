new york 's republican candidate for governor carl paladino says he 's " not anti-gay and that homosexuality is an equally valid and successful option " to recruit gays and lesbians , reports politico . " i just think my children and your children would be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family , and i do n't know if you 've ever been to one , " he said . " it 's a very difficult thing . " paladino , who has a reputation for being frank to the point of gay rights , says he is " absolutely " anti-gay and " homosexual , " reports the star-ledger . " we have no problem with it whatsoever . my only reservation is marriage . it 's not how god created us .
