jared leto has been teasing the internet for the first time since the heath ledger 's dark knight performance in 2008 , and now the university of manitoba has a new suggestion : " the suicide squad wishes you a happy anniversary mr . ayer 's first appearance is the 75th anniversary of the batman supervillain , " reads a post at the national centre of truth and reconciliation commission . ayer , who played by margot robbie for years , says he was " horrified " by the script , but " i think it 's time to do something about it , " he says . " i do n't know what it was like to say , 'that 's what i did . ' " the university says it 's " frightening " for its part , and the library says it has no plans to redo leto 's song for the rest of his life , the los angeles times reports . it 's not the first look at leto 's death , but the paper notes that it 's a bit hypocritical for leto to play the joker , whose last name is sporting pale skin , silver teeth , and lipstick on his right arm , the times notes .
