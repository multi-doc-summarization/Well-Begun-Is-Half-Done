mitt romney 's plan to repeal obama 's obamacare law is to overturn the obamacare rollout , reports the new york times . " you have to deal with those people who are currently uninsured , and help them have the opportunity to have insurance , " he said . " but then once people have all had that opportunity to become insured , if someone chooses to become a doctor , the government or by the hospital . " he added : " now i want insurance , ’ you could hardly say to an insurance company , ‘ oh , you must take this person now that they ’ re sick , ' or there ’ d literally be no reason to have insurance. ” romney , meanwhile , insists that he does n't have a setting across this country where if the law does n't apply , " it 's not going to be a problem , " and that 's not the case . " i think it 's going to happen . " but the white house is n't buying it . " we 're going to die when you have your heart attack , " says a spokesman for the national library of medicine . " no , you go to the hospital , you get treated , and it ’ s paid for , either by charity . " the washington post debunks a list of other things , including the fact that it 's a safe bet that taxpayers will be able to opt out of obamacare altogether .
