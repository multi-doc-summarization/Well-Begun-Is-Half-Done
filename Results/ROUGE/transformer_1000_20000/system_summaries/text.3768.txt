it 's a couple of months since the toulouse company filed a patent application for a new type of aircraft , but it 's not the first time the airbus sa class is making headlines . the <unk> class , which looked like a raindrop on its side ( or like some of the jet-propelled cars designed to break the world land speed record ) , is tasked with retrieving doughnuts . " it doesn ’ t mean that we ’ re going to be working on making it a reality. <unk> were to try to develop the model commercially , it would have to overcome some formidable technical and regulatory obstacles , " a spokesman for the company says in a statement . " the fact that passengers are supposed to board from below via a radical design might easily require changes to the infrastructure at airports ( much like the amphitheater ) , for example . " if you prefer a " simple , economic and efficient solution " to the idea that the model might be removed to improve aerodynamic performance . the patent filing also includes space for more passengers who sit in a circular cabin , the los angeles times reports . the patent application is expected to take place in october for the foreseeable future , and it 's expected to remain on the drawing board , which is currently in the works .
