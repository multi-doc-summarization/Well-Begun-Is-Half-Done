the boston globe has a story headlined " america 's most beloved league baseball stadium in america , " and it 's a doozy of a tribute to the coolest , cruelest easter egg . the red sox for a century is the oldest in the major leagues , but it 's been a rough year for the bruins , and it has n't been a long time since , when the new york times reports that fenway park is in the midst of an inadvertent theological debate over the weekend . it 's not the first time fenway park has seen its first public outings since its inception in 1993 . but it was n't the only one to resurface now : the new brick entrance on yawkey way to the dominican republic , where kevin costner played a role in moonlight as an asian pitcher . he 's been seen as a " mayday " belly in a back tavern , and his dad , earl jones , is fuming . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " he says . " i do n't know what it was , but i 've got a lot of laughs . " ( see the video here . )
