el salvador 's health ministry says it is " painful to see the little creature . " the 22-year-old woman was born without a brain injury , but the fetus was n't at risk , reports the ap . " no one can say how long she will live , " says the ministry of health . " that 's what the grandmother told us , 'if you do n't have the procedure , you can do it . ' " the country 's supreme court last week prohibited an abortion for the fetus , which is illegal in the country . the woman , known only as beatriz for privacy reasons , underwent the operation in the afternoon after 27 weeks of pregnancy , and the fetus had a serious condition known as anencephaly . the health ministry can determine what is most medically sound for a mother versus the unborn child , but it says it will allow the fetus to save her life . el salvador , for its part , says it has no plans to allow the c-section to save the woman 's life . but it 's not the first time el salvador has banned all abortions in the us since the pregnancy . the bbc reports that a woman in el salvador who had been in the close watch of the pregnancy says her fetus " was already in stable condition .
