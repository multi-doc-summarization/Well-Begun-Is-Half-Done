john mccain 's pravda story in the new york times is getting rave reviews for the soviet union 's pravda pravda takedown of the russian president . " if john mccain wants to write something for us , he is welcome , " he writes . " in addition ... we 'll be only pleased to publish a story penned by such a prominent politician as john mccain . " mccain 's communications director responded within minutes . " i am convinced that we would not agree on many things that he would have to say in his column , but an article like that would obviously be published in english and then translated into russian so that all our russian readers could read what mr. mccain has to say , " mccain writes . " the beginning of this surprising arrangement all started last night when your cable guy watched an interview between mccain and cnn 's jake tapper . so i believe that mr. mccain is not aware of the real state of affairs in my country when he expresses his judgements of freedom of speech . " mccain , meanwhile , says he would love to have a commentary in pravda , which he calls " a fancy public relations firm . "
