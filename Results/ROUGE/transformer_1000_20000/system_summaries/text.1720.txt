it 's been a rough year for the first time since the permian mass extinction , but it 's now a milestone for the permian period : scientists say they 've found a correlation between methane and carbon dioxide , the ap reports . that 's the conclusion of a study published monday in the journal of sciences , which found that the creature had been blamed for the loss of 90 % of its energy attributable to the mass extinction . the researchers say that while the extinction rates in the seas seem to be rising , the probability of the extinction is that the extinction of the five mass extinctions in earth 's history is the result of a huge increase in volcanic activity . " the scale of this calamity made the one that doomed the planet 65 million years ago was catastrophic , " the lead researcher says . " this is a very big step forward . " the study 's lead author , gregory <unk> , says the findings are based on calculations from the university of chicago . " i think there 's a lot of unknowns , " he says . " we 've got a lot more energy to say about what we are going to do . " the researchers , who describe the study as " the strongest empirical evidence in the history of human civilization , " say the study is a " huge step forward " that could be " a game-changer or a microscope to find a glimmer of hope . " ( another recent study found that volcanic eruptions may have been a bad idea . )
