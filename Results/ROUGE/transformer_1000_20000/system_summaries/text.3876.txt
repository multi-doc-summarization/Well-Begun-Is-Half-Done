german authorities say they 've uncovered a " serious depressive episode " six years ago , but they have n't found a glimmer of hope . the bbc reports that andreas lubitz , 27 , would take the controls of the airbus a320 and lock the captain out of the cockpit , which is believed to have crashed into the french alps on tuesday , killing 150 people . the ap reports that he was cleared of wrongdoing by german authorities once they had been examined , but it 's not clear why and said he had passed all tests to be fit to fly . lufthansa says it is investigating whether lubitz had taken a break during his training six years in psychiatric treatment and that the relevant documents would be passed to french investigators . lufthansa says lubitz spent a total of one and a half years at the time , but he did n't disclose any details about the pilot 's whereabouts . the bbc notes that the plane 's voice recorder has not yet been revealed , but the bbc says it 's " extremely rare " that the pilot was locked out in the cockpit . " it 's very exciting to see what happened to him , " says a lufthansa rep . " we do n't have a problem with it . "
