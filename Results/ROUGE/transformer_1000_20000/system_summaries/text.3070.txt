tony dungy , the nfl 's first openly homosexual player , won a high school in jackson , mich. , on the no . 1 television show in america . the tampa bay times reports that the st. louis rams rejected the concept that blacks either were n't deserving/capable of such opportunities . " even more important , they ignored the idiotic idea that until every last racist was completely and wholly comfortable with a black man playing , learning or working alongside them ( let alone be the boss ) then such opportunity should continue to be totally smooth â€¦ things will happen , " dungy says . " this thinking is devoid of courage in every possible way . and that 's what makes this so pathetic . dungy has a well-earned reputation as a straight shooter and a stand-up guy . it 's almost impossible to play and work in the nfl without self-belief and heart . he is a powerful figure . he says a lot of smart things . " he knows tough times and consistently finds time for people going through them . he should n't want to deal with all of it . "
