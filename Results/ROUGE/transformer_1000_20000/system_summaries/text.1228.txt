a shipwreck off the coast of michigan 's keystone state has yielded a new one : the ship 's mysterious cargo hold was mislabeled on the manifest , reports the new york times . " she wasn ’ t where she was supposed to be , " says david trotter . " i probably thought i ’ d never find anything . " trotter 's team found the wreck , which was built in 1849 and is now the second largest ship on the great lakes when it was spotted off port austin and the keystone state 's coast . it 's not clear whether the ship had sunk until more than a week later , but it 's now believed that the ship , which has remained one of the many waning days , will be tested for the ship . trotter says it 's " very optimistic " that it will be able to find the ship . the shipwreck is expected to fetch up to $ <unk> million , and it 's expected to cost $ <unk> million to cover the $ <unk> schooner currently held in milwaukee , wis. , on nov. 8 , 1861 , carrying what the times calls a " natural suspicion . " trotter notes that the steamer 's state of lake huron passed into rough water in november , and the state 's captain says it will " continue to investigate the wreck . "
