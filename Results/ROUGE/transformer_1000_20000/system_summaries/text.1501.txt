" the investigation is ongoing , with a number of gun sales clocking in at more than a quarter of the total number of firearms violence in washington , dc , and boston . in fact , it 's not clear how many of the gun listings will be used to acquire guns , ammo , and other drugs . " we 've got a lot of guns on the internet , " a gun rights activist says . " we 're going to get a gun out of the pocket of a gun . it 's a matter of time . "
