scientists have found a correlation between frozen blood flow and ice crystals in the frigid waters of antarctica , upi reports . in a study published wednesday in plos one , researchers found that the antifreeze proteins ' anti-melting proteins were found to be linked to ice crystals and inhibit them from melting the ice crystals . the study was published in the journal plos one . the scientists say that while the species were n't genetically modifying the veins , it was n't clear how much the ice was impacted . the study , published in nature , calls the study " a significant step forward " for the fish of antarctica . the researchers say the study 's lead author , paul <unk> , says the findings could help explain why the veins of the fish have been shown to decrease the risk of growing ice in the region . " this is not the first study to date , " he says . " we have a lot more energy to do , and we have to do everything that we can do to protect our species . " scientists say the fish could also be responsible for the ecological effects of climate change in the 1960s and may not be able to reduce the ice 's ice crystals by reducing greenhouse gases in the ice to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the study also found that phytoplankton could cause ice to accelerate the effects of ice crystals , which can lead to climate change . " we can not conclude that this species will die in the coming years , " the lead researcher says .
