the harvard men ’ s cross country team is backtracking on a story about the women ’ s soccer team , and the new york times reports that it ’ s “ not worth our time or effort to dwell on , ” says a harvard professor . “ we ’ re going to have a problem with that , ” he says . “ i ’ ve never seen anything like this . but i ’ m not going to be complacent about the importance of addressing the issue . " the report also accuses the women of being “ ignorant ” about their physical appearance . “ i think they ’ re trying to understand what ’ s going to happen , ” the university ’ s superintendent says . “ they ’ ve got a lot of people who have been affected by the fact that they have no idea what they were doing . " the team ’ s chief of staff says they ’ d be “ shocked ” by the report , but they have n't spoken to the media about the report . “ we don ’ t know how much of it will be , ” one student says . “ it is a reality that all women have faced in the past and will continue to face throughout their lives . ”
