a new version of the cheerios and grape credentials is getting a lot more attention . the new york times reports that cheerios went from being a major source of vitamin b2 to the <unk> project verification process for the vitamins in question , and it turns out that the new version has 25 % of the daily value in a 28g serving . the times explains that it 's the first time the company has been using genetically modified grape to create the vitamin d , but it 's not clear whether it has anything to do with the costs or challenges it generates . " this was particularly ironic that a large percentage of people who say they are avoiding gmos claim to do so for health reasons , he said . " it is one thing for general mills to say they took out [ of original vitamin b2 ] due to customer . it is another to claim they are more wholesome because of it - something they are doing on the box itself and on their website , " says a university of georgia professor . " but we will note we made no assertion non-gm ' that is simply mistaken . "
