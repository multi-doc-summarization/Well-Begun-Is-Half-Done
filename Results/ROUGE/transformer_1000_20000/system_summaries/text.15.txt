" the volcano , believed to be the volcano 's first eruption in the tonga national region , is believed to have been around 100 miles northwest of the capital , reports the ap , which notes that the island is about 273 feet deep . it 's not clear whether the volcano stops erupting , but the new zealand meteorological ministry says it 's investigating whether the eruption will occur . " it 's quite an exciting site , you get to see the birth of an island , " says a spokesman for new zealand agency gns science . he says that while the eruption is not uncommon in the area , it will likely take the ocean no more than a few months to erode the island entirely . he says it will need to be made of lava or something more durable to survive .
