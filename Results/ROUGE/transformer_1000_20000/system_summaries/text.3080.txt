it 's been a rough year for the first time since the 15th century , and now it 's finally over . the guardian reports that antony had been hauled out of the ground by crew members after he was handcuffed and buried in a grave under six feet of soil . " i gave it my all , but it just wasn â€™ t my day , " he says . " i could feel myself losing consciousness and there was nothing i could do about it . " so why did the escape happen ? " it was scary . the pressure of the soil around me was crushing me even more . even when i found the soil , when i had to be rescued , i was just seconds away from death . " that 's when antony free of the escapade , which is used to make it difficult to detect the wearer 's body . " i was pretty much dying , " says the director of the royal society of human sciences , which has a history of mental illness . but it 's not all bad news for antony free , who says he 's in the best company to make sure it 's safe to say that it 's time to do so , and that 's exactly what happened in the 1980s . it 's the first escape bid to be seen in a movie that 's been seen in the past five years . " i 've had a lot of people who 've ever experienced this , " she says . " but everyone was on the ball and the crew was well-drilled . " ( this man was killed in a car crash . )
