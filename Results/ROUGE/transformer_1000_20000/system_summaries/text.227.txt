a new study out of the university of boston suggests that potatoes with a sharp rise in blood sugar levels may be the result of a higher risk of gestational diabetes . the study looked at 21,000 women who had no history of illness before pregnancy , and found that those who eat more starchy foods were more likely to die prematurely , reports the guardian . the researchers looked at the results of a study published in the bmj , which found that the foods had eaten during the previous year of the week . the study , published in bmj , found that women who consume fewer potatoes may have higher rates of gestational or type 2 diabetes . the researchers found that potatoes in the foods were associated with a high glycemic index in the mother 's bloodstream , which was associated with high blood pressure . the researchers say that while they were n't aware of the foods , they do n't know how much they were doing , and that 's what they did . " we do n't think we were going to have a big impact on the pregnancy , " lead researcher hu <unk> tells the guardian . " it 's a good thing to do . " the researchers note that the study 's lead author , dr. cuilin zhang , says the findings are " very troubling " and that " the fact that this is not the case of the iceberg is going away after the birth of eunice kennedy , " per the washington post . ( another study found that a man 's diabetes risk could help his brain stem . )
