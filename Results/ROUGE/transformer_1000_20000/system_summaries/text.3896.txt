ayatollah ali khamenei says he was " ludicrous and shallow , " but he was n't happy about it . " i congratulate and see as a good deed the vicious withdrawal of the us from the jcpoa , which was not credible even before the us president broke with european allies , " he said in a statement , per the guardian . " i say it on behalf of iranian people , mr trump , you can â€™ t do a damn thing ! " he added , per nbc news . " the body of this man , trump , will turn to ashes and become the food of the worms and ants , while the islamic republic continues to stand. . " the new york times , meanwhile , reports that iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei , has called for a boycott of the 2015 nuclear deal , which the times calls a " horrible , one-sided affair . " khamenei did n't say whether he 'd ever met with any anti-government group , but he did say that he 'd be willing to do so , and that he 's not the only one who has n't spoken to the president , the guardian reports . " the only thing i can say is that the president is not going to do this , " trump said . " he 's going to be very forceful . "
