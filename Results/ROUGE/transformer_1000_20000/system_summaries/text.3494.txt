the supreme court 's decision on supreme court nominee merrick garland is " a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting supreme court justices , " writes steven smith at the washington post . the decision was 7-1 , but it was n't the first time the justice department 's decision was unanimous . " imagine , for a minute , that democrats win the senate in 2018 , and the other side breaks another in response to the question of whether they will be able to vote for the nomination , " he writes . " if you 're going to get a vote on the court , you should n't have to do that . " the upshot is that the court will decide whether to appeal the decision , and it 's not clear whether it will be filled in an election year or two years . the senate is expected to vote in favor of a 6-3 ruling that would allow the court to re-examine its arguments , reports the new york times , which notes that the senate will decide on whether to proceed with the nomination . it 's doubtful the decision will be a sign that the justices will have to wait until 2019 , when it comes to the final phase of the lame-duck session . " it 's the first supreme court decision in the history books , " says the editorial . " this is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful people in the world . "
