dominique strauss-kahn has been accused of trying to rape her , but the new york times reports that the former international monetary fund chief has filed a $ 6 million lawsuit against the french presidential contender . the deal , which comes after prosecutors dropped related to strauss-kahn 's alleged involvement in the 2011 rape of a former french diplomat , is likely to be veiled by a confidentiality agreement . diallo 's lawyer , william taylor iii , declined to comment on the allegations , but said he would get her day in a different court . " he now faces charges linking him to a suspected prostitution ring in his home country , " he said in a statement . diallo 's lawyers say she told the truth about their encounter with the housekeeper , nafissatou diallo , in which she said she had " no idea " about the encounter , and that the housekeeper did not disclose the details of the encounter . diallo 's attorney said thursday that the deal was " defamatory and countersued her for $ 1 million . " she said he had no intention of pursuing the case , but that he did n't believe it was a hoax , the ap reports .
