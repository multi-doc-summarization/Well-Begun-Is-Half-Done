the captain of the wrecked cruise ship that ran aground on the coast of giglio , italy , says he thought constantly about the victims of the disaster . " when there 's an accident , it 's not just the ship that 's identified or the company , " francesco schettino told italy 's canale 5 television , speaking calmly but with a pronounced tic in one eye . " the captain is identified and so it 's normal that i should apologize as a representative of this system , " he said , per reuters . " it was as though there was a blackout in everyone 's heads and in the instruments . " schettino , who is charged with multiple manslaughter , admitted to failing to act decisively enough once it became clear the ship was under the command of another officer at the time . he said the actual sailing vessel had come too close to the island , but he did n't have command , that 's to say being in charge of sailing the ship . " i blame myself for being distracted , ” he said . " the actual thing , i went up to the deck and ordered the ship to be put on manual and i wouldn ’ t have command . "
