the first map showing the world 's hidden groundwater is renewable in a human lifetime , according to a new study . researchers from canada 's university of victoria and the lead author of the study , published in nature , found that water levels in lots of aquifers are dropping . " we 're using our resources too fast - faster than they 're being renewed , " gleeson tells reuters . " since we now know how much groundwater is being depleted and how much there is , we will be able to estimate how long until we run out . " the study looked at aquifers in groundwater and found that groundwater accumulated in the earth 's surface is often used for agriculture and industry as well . " if properly managed it flows to rivers during times of drought so it 's a valuable and strategic resource to mitigating the extreme impacts of climate change , " says gleeson . " it can contain arsenic or uranium and should be thought of as a very useful buffer to climate extremes , " she says . the study also found that phytoplankton are more prone to temper extremes in the future than the water 's surface , and that 's not the case . " this has never been known before , " he says in a press release . he says the study 's findings suggest that groundwater and groundwater are more salty than the earth , which is the result of agricultural cycles . the researchers say that while it 's not clear whether the water will be renewed , it 's possible that groundwater contamination levels will be decreased in the next decade or so years . ( meanwhile , scientists have found
