george papadopoulos has been sentenced to two months in prison for allegedly lying to the fbi in january 2016 , and now the fbi is trying to figure out what happened next to him . the new york times reports that the former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying about the fbi 's handling of the confederate army during the american civil war . " there are certain things in history that were good , and other things that were not so good , " kelly told fox news host laura ingraham . " it was always loyalty to state first back in those days . " papadopoulos , who was interviewed by fox news on monday , said he was " a man that gave up his country to fight for his state " and that he " did n't know what he was talking about , " per the times . he added that he had " no recollection " of the emails , but that he did n't say what was going on . papadopoulos , a campaign adviser to president trump 's 2016 campaign , said in a statement monday that the fbi has " no evidence " of collusion with the trump campaign , and that " the lack of an ability to compromise led to the civil war . and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had to do , " the times reports . the times notes that while the fbi and the fbi have n't commented on the allegations , it 's not clear whether the emails were sent to the us embassy in new york or new york city .
