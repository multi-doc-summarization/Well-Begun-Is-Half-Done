john boehner 's speech upon becoming speaker of the house of representatives last night was just a matter of time , but he was n't exactly the only one to do . " it was , i think , as smart a speech as i 've seen a politician give , " he said in a speech to ezra klein in the washington post . " he certainly did n't set himself up as a foil to president obama , or anoint himself leader of a new conservative moment in american politics . " he added , " we are carrying out their instructions . " boehner , meanwhile , said that he held the gavel for " a new america that declares our energy independence , domestic sources of renewable energy , and combats climate change . " the speech is the easy part of the 112th partisan divide , and the fact that it was savvy about what it did n't say , which is a rare offense in favor of a symbolic vote that wo n't exactly sit well with conservatives , notes the new york times . " it 's still just me . "
