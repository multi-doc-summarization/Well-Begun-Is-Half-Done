dr. prabhjot singh , a young american professor at columbia university , was attacked by a public street gang saturday night by the nypd , the new york times reports . " my brother and i immediately jumped in a taxi and rushed to the hospital , where we finally saw prabhjot being wheeled in , bloody and bruised , his face from a fractured jaw . he could n't speak because many of his teeth had been displaced , but he waved limply to let us know that he was okay , " singh says . " we joined prabhjot in his hospital room and were surprised to find it already filled with officers from the nypd and its hate crime task force . " singh , who was punched in the face repeatedly until falling to the ground , is now in critical condition . " i do n't know how much worse it could have been . he had just returned from dinner , dropping his wife and son at home before going for a walk , " he says , per the washington post . but singh says he 's not the only one to do that , and that 's what happened next to him . singh says his friend told him the assailants had taunted him as they beat him , calling him " osama " and " terrorist . " but he says he does n't know what he 's talking about , and he 's been trying to figure out why he 's going to do so , and " i 'm going to have to do something that 's going on , " the times notes , adding that he 's " very concerned " about his mental health problems
