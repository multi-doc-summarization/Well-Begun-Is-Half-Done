" he added : " it 's a bit of a selective memory—you won ’ t find gifts , beacon , or the like button . " the move follows a spate of similar videos in 2005 , and the journal sees it as an example of how facebook is able to use its algorithms . " it ’ s not the first time this has happened , " says a facebook spokesperson . " this is not a matter of 'could happen . ' " the company 's chief technology writer says the company is trying to figure out how to fix the site 's problems , reports the new york times , which notes that facebook has launched a wave of criticism over the past few years .
