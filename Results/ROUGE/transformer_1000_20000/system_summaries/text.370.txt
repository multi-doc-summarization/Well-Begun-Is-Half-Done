the house judiciary committee says it is investigating the executive order of donald trump to fire the acting attorney general , the washington post reports . according to the new york times , the white house consulted capitol hill about the order , which was unveiled friday . the sources say the order was " extremely rare for administration officials to circumvent republican leadership and work directly with congressional committee aides . " the trump administration says it was " not consulted by the administration , " but it did n't say whether the pacts were conducted , the ap reports . according to politico , the house intelligence committee has been investigating the order . according to nbc news , the order prohibits refugees from being used to unlock the mystery of whether or not they were on capitol hill who knew of the looming executive order . the committee 's top immigration negotiator , bob goodlatte , said friday that " the small group of staffers were among the most experienced staffers when it comes to immigration policy . " he said that while the house is responsible for the final policy decisions , it will be unusual to extend that requirement to congressional employees .
