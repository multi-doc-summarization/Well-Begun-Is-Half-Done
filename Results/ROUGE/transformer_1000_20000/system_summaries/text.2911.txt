" it 's not the first time weiner has been fired , but he 's been accused of sexual assault by the media , and that he 's " a little piece of collateral damage from the weiner family . " it seems that weiner 's camp contains " once-private details , " and that 's what he 's talking about . " i 've never seen anything like this , " he writes . " but i 've got to say that this is the life of a woman who has been on the other end of this year . " in the wake of the sexting scandal , rhoades writes that she 's " frustrated " by the fact that weiner is a porn star , but that does n't mean she should n't be able to speak freely with the media .
