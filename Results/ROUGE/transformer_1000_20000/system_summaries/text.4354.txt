" i 'm pretty confident it was . allow myself to tell you a story about ... myself , " he wrote . " my answer , was always , 'where are you going to be kidding me ? ' " he added , per the new york daily news . " i was not in those meetings with the coaches and administrative people . " the letter , which was signed by frazier glenn jordan , says frazier was " very careful in how i answered the question " when asked if i thought it was because of my recent activism for same-sex marriage rights , and that he had n't spoken to the vikings , reports espn . " this is a record of what happened to me during my 2012 season with the privilege of being a private citizen , not as a spokesman for the vikings .
