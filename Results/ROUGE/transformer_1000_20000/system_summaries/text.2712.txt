a rotisserie chicken salad is getting a lot of flak over the past few years , and it 's not the only thing you 'd expect to see . the rotisserie chicken is about to pass its expiration date , but it 's a little more complicated than a fifth-grader , reports bloomberg . " you know we have chickens for sale up at the front of the store that have already been cooked , right ? " he says . " i took it home , rubbed it in butter and herbs , shoved a lemon half up its butt , and roasted it low and slow for the majority of the day . " that 's because the rotisserie chickens were actually cheaper than buying and roasting my own creations . the problem is that trader joe 's is n't buying it . " it 's an elegant way to save a little money here and there are just as important in improving our standard of living . especially when it 's five minutes to 7 and you hear someone talk about the innovation economy , do n't just think of facebook or google , " he writes . " this is the sort of thing that no one talks about when they talk about innovation . "
