the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders is out , and it 's a doozy of a new report from the national institute of mental health . the new york times reports that the creators of the d.s.m manual used primarily by the nih to diagnose mental disorders in the 1960s and '70s , when they were tasked with finding out how to cope with the disease . " they chose a model in which all psychiatric illnesses were represented as categories discontinuous with ‘ normal. ' but this is totally wrong in a way they couldn ’ t have imagined , " says dr. steven hyman hyman , a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the broad institute and a former director at the national institutes of health . " it was an absolute nightmare , " he says , per the times . " i think it 's because of the prevalence of the disease . " but the times notes that it 's not clear how many people who get one diagnosis , or whether it will be a " critical nightmare " for the apa 's findings , but the paper notes that the apa has been trying to figure out how much the disorder is needed , and that 's not the case . in a blog post headlined , " we will be covering it in the weeks to come here on the american psychiatric association .
