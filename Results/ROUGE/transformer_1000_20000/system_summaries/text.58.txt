" i 've done it as well and as respectfully as i think anyone can . " he said he was aged 90 . " i feel like it , " he told cnn . he added that he had lived a " conflict-free life , " and that he " was alert , engaged , and quick to smile , even letting out a laugh when parole board chairman connie bisbee accidentally shot nicole brown in the face . " it 's been 22 years since the not guilty verdict , the murder trial 's themes of criminal justice and race , trust in police , celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture . " we talk about o.j . as though the story is o.j. , " simpson said in a statement . " and the many months more than 20 years ago when it felt like 1995 again , that was the year he was acquitted of murder . " but for one thing , he added , " i am not going to have to go to jail . " he also said he 'd have no regrets about the robbery , but that he did n't believe it was a model prisoner . he said that " it was time for me to get a conviction . "
