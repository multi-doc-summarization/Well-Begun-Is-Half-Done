scientists from the us and denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth 's crust that 's responsible for the famous old faithful geyser and other features at yellowstone national park . throughout november the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant , hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter . the device acts like an x-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface , reports the ap . the team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but massive explosions that occur in the park , said lead scientist carol finn with the us geological survey . one such explosion occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles across at the bottom of lake . it 's believed to be the largest crater in the world . similar to the regular eruptions of old faithful , finn said . " nobody knows anything about the flow " for the hot water that erupts from water to steam and explode violently to the surface . similar work elsewhere in the us has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes . it 's able to discern between water and rocks to a depth of about 1,500 feet beneath the ground . the electromagnetic system was developed in denmark to <unk> out groundwater supplies in denmark . " does it travel down and back up ? " the study says , per phys.org .
