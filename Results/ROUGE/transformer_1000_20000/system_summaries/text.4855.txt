a new study in molecular psychiatry finds that people who smoke for six years are more likely to commit schizophrenia than those who do n't develop it . researchers at king 's institute of psychiatry say they 've found that schizophrenia is a " common and severe psychiatric disorder , " the guardian reports . the study looked at 1,000 people between ages 25 and 81 , and found that the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher among people with schizophrenia than in the general population . the study found that those who had used the drug were twice as likely to have psychotic experiences , and the results of the study suggest that the link between schizophrenia and schizophrenia is the result of the onset of schizophrenia . " our findings certainly does not rule this out , but it suggests that there is likely to be an association in the other direction as well that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of a person 's risk , " says the lead researcher , per the guardian . " this is not a matter of time . " the researchers say that while they do n't know how much the drug is applied , they do posit a possible link between the drug and schizophrenia and the drug , which can be used to treat schizophrenia and other diseases like schizophrenia . ( another study finds that schizophrenia could help prevent alzheimer 's . )
