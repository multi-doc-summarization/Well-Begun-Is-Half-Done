stanford university is banning consumption of hard alcohol by undergraduates at campus parties , reports the guardian . the prohibition would include mixed drinks and shots of hard liquor containers , but not beer and wine , at on-campus parties , the university says in a statement . " our intention is not a total prohibition of a substance , but rather a targeted approach that limits high-risk consumption , " says the director of the stanford office of alcohol policy and education . the decision comes after several recent incidents on campus including the case of brock turner , who was sentenced in june to six months in prison for sexually assaulting a drunken woman after a party party when he was 20 . " our focus is on the high risk of the rapid consumption of alcohol , " he says . " undergraduates and older can still have beer in their rooms , but the days of " animal house " are over , university officials say . the university 's university of michigan says it will " speak out against the college , " but it will be allowed at parties hosted by student organizations and residences where graduate students live . the new york times reports that in a monday presser , boardman said that " hard alcohol will be prohibited at all categories of activities . " but the times notes that there 's no indication that the new rules will be implemented , and it 's not clear how many students will be able to register as a sexual assault victim .
