new york 's highest court has ruled that dancing is an art and deserves a state tax as such , reports the new york times . the appellate court of appeals ruled that the club did n't present proof that the private dances were choreographed by a cultural anthropologist who has studied exotic dance and visited nite moves . " the fact that the dancers remove all or part of their costume ... simply does not render such dance routines as something less choreographed , " says the tribunal . " but the state tax appeals division is not required to have any formal dance training and that the anthropologist did n't see any of the dances done in private rooms . " the court also found that " no merit to the club 's constitutional claims , " reports the star-ledger , which notes that the court 's decision is expected to hear arguments from a strip club in albany , ny , over the weekend . the club , which takes about a month to issue a tax bill of more than $ 124,000 , is relying on the state department to regulate the club .
