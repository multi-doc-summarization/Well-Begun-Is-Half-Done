a dutch tree that went missing in the attic of the anne frank house has been turned into a museum and was full of tourists . " it broke off completely about one metre the ground , " a spokesman for the house tells the ap . " it is covered with leaves and is even more beautiful than last year . " the tree was one of the few signs of nature visible to the jewish teenager from the attic she hid in for at least two years . the tree , which is believed to have lived for 150 years , was set to be felled by concerns for the safety of the 1 million people who visit frank 's house each year . " you have to bow your head to the facts . the tree has fallen and will be cut into pieces and it 's over and we â€™ re not going to extend it , " says a house official . " it has been a last-minute step forward . " the nazis were killed in a concentration camp in amsterdam last year , and authorities say they believe the tree had rotted , but they believe it was the result of a fungus that killed dozens of years ago .
