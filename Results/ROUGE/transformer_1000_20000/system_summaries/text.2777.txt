the european court of justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar maker who says the wafer 's shape is " quick lunch . " that 's what the bbc calls a " previous court had been right to annul the shape of the teatime treat , which has been around for 80 years . the ruling came after the eu voted to approve a trademark in 1988 , the bbc reports . the ruling , which was spearheaded by mondelez 's milka brand , also accuses the eu of trying to trademark " kitkat " for its shape . " there was no issue with the bar itself , " the head of the kit kat , similar to parent company mondelez , says in a statement . " it 's not a good idea . " the eu 's decision to amend the trademark is expected to overturn the trademark , which would allow nestl√© to defend its trademark office . the eu , which opposes the trademark in 2012 , says it will appeal to the eu to decide whether to appeal the ruling . " we want to make sure that it does n't matter how much it will be , " says a spokesman for the eu . " it is a matter of time . "
