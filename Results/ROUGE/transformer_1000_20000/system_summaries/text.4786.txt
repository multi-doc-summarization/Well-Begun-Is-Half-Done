the national association of theatre says it has worked for years in latin america and canada , but it says it 's launching an experiment in one us state by the end of this year . " there are meetings this week about doing a test with a discount. , " nato chief john fithian says in a press release . " it makes sense , he says , because our capacity is so unused , " which is why " we are looking aggressively at it .
