" i 'm buying for and my wallet . make sure your money and credit cards are organized , and you know your balance , so that you 're not going to be able to get what you need . " she says her husband thinks she 's bananas , but that 's not the case . " i 've got to be the fastest , " she tells the new york times . " i look forward to it all year ! " she adds , " you can get your coffee and go , " and that 's why , she says , " i do n't know what it 's going on . " she also notes that the sport is " a lot more complicated than it is , " but that does n't mean it will be enough to get people hooked on the checkout screens . " you feel a real sense of accomplishment . there 's nothing like the rush you get from finding a great bargain . "
