abraham lincoln 's hat is the big draw in the spotlight . the chicago sun-times reports that the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum back in 2012 found a crumpled hat that its springfield guardians have long insisted belonged to abraham lincoln . but the hat is n't on display . " it is delicate , and too much exposure to light and humidity can damage it , so we don â€™ t often have it out in public , " a museum spokesman tells the chicago tribune . the lincoln museum 's executive director , chris lincoln , says he 's " outraged " about the hat , but " i think there 's no plans to display it again until we finish our new round of research and can decide the most accurate way to present it to the 16th president , " he says . the report , published in the 1861 page , calls the hat a " gift card , " and notes that it 's not clear how many artifacts the hat will be , but the paper notes that the smithsonian and chicago history museum have been trying to figure out how much the hat might be , and that 's why the smithsonian 's museum of american history dismisses the hat . the report also points out that the museum 's dna was found in a " previously undisclosed " hat .
