" i am saddened by the fact that we are losing him and that the physiological stress of the surgery was apparently too much for his compromised anatomy , " says dr. robert marx , chief of oral and maxillofacial surgery for the university of miami , per the miami herald . zayas and his family were concerned it was big enough to suffocate zayas or break his neck . last month , doctors revealed a surgery had been scheduled to have the tumor removed . " our hopes of saving his life , and with that allowing him a better quality of life , were not realized , " marx says . " another angel has arrived in heaven . " zayas 's condition is known as polyostotic fibrous dysplasia , which caused the boy 's body to develop scar-like tissue instead of bone . marx says his parents thought it was just a pimple , but the tumor eventually grew bigger than a basketball . " our condolences and prayers for emanuel 's family and the loss of a very brave young man , " he tells nbc 6 , adding that he hopes to " help them learn more about fibrous dysplasia . "
