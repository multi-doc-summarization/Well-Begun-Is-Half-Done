" the fbi is doing a great job . they are working very hard to determine as much as they are . " he added , " we are really working from the perspective of caution , " adding that it 's " unfortunate and sad that these incidents continue to disrupt the education of children . " the school 's superintendent called the threat a " parent 's daughter is a junior " and " like most parents , this is the world we live in , " and said that " we do n't know what the threat was credible , " per the washington post .
