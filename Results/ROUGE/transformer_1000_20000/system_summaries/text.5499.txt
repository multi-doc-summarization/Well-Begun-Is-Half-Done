the fda is proposing a ban on teens under 18 from tanning beds , but the fda says it will " help protect young people from a known and preventable cause of skin cancer and other harms . " the move comes after the fda announced friday that the ban would ban children from 18 and older , the new york times reports . " today ’ s action is intended to help protect public health by informing consumers of the risks of indoor tanning products , " the fda said in a statement . " individuals under 18 years are at greatest risk of the adverse health consequences of indoor tanning. ” the fda , meanwhile , says the move is a " big step forward " for the first time in more than a decade . " we have a lot of people who have been exposed to radiation from ultraviolet radiation , " says acting commissioner stephen ostroff . " we are not going to have a problem with how much we can do this . " the rules , which include e-cigarettes and sun lamps , have also been put on desk duty for 18 months . it 's not clear how many tanning beds will be , but it 's unclear how many calories will be produced . " we 're not sure how many people will be affected , but we do n't know how to do this , " ostroff says .
