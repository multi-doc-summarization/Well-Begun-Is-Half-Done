george washington is believed to have enjoyed a celebratory drink during the american revolution in new york city , but he 's not alone . the new york times reports that the bull 's head , cellar , is the former site of an 18th-century tavern that was built in 1879 . " after the english had marched up the bowery and out of the city ( in 1783 , george washington and governor ( in the basement ) , bones were still inside , " woodward tells the paper . " i just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries . " the site 's owner , adam woodward , says he 's " compelled to investigate in the building , which once housed a chain of drugstore and the atlantic garden beer garden . " he says it 's " pretty incredible walking back in time 250 years . " but he says he does n't believe the bull was buried , and he believes it was a " distinct tavern , " the times reports . he says the building was built by a chinese tavern , but it was n't the only one to hide it , and that it was the " bull â€™ head " of the revolutionary war-era tavern , where it was built at the time of the revolution . he says that while he believes the building would make it very likely the oldest building remaining in existence , it would have been a distinct entity that would be able to get rid of it . the times notes that the basement of the building 's oldest tavern , built in the 1930s , has had a lot of laughs lately ,
