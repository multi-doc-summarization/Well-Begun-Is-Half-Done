the wall street journal is out with a story headlined " the women of wall ' group wear a shawl and tefillin , leather straps and boxes containing sacred parchments , that orthodox law says only men should don , during a monthly prayer session at the western wall in jerusalem 's old city . the new york times takes a look at what 's happening in the old city : " the ultra-orthodox jewish women as members of 'women of the wall ' and police forming a human barrier between the female group and the sacred wall . " it 's not clear how many men will be able to speak freely about the torah wall , but the christian science monitor reports that it 's a little more complicated than the fact that men are n't allowed to speak to the public . " i think it 's time to do something about it , " says a woman who attended the prayer session . " i do n't know what it 's going to happen . " the israeli government has n't commented on the ruling , but a spokesman for the council of public defender <unk> <unk> tells the times that the ruling is " nonsense " to the contrary . " this is a watershed moment for women , " he says . " it is a matter of time . "
