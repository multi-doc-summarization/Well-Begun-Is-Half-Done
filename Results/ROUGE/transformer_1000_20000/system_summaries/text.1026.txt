a new study out of the university of virginia finds that the ventrolateral frontal cortex is unlike anything in the brains of humans . researchers looked at 25 mri scans and found that the brain is involved in many of the highest aspects of cognition and language , and they were able to compare the 12 areas in the human brain region with the rest of the brain , reports phys.org . " we tend to think that being able to plan into the future , be flexible in our approach and learn from others are things that are particularly impressive about humans , " says lead researcher matthew rushworth . " we 've identified an area in human frontal cortex , which does not seem to have an equivalent in the monkey at all . " the study , published in plos one , found that people who had no equivalent of adhd were more likely to be connected to other brain areas . " each of these 12 areas has its own pattern of connections with the [ brain ] that appears to be human and is likely to have something to do with these cognitive powers , " rushworth says in a press release . the researchers also found that mri data from 25 macaque monkeys showed that the frontal cortex had been altered to divide the brain . " we have established an area of the <unk> brain , in human brain tissue , a sort of " neural fingerprint " in the study . the study also found the correlation between humans and primates , and the fact that they were n't connected to humans . ( another study found that humans have a " very different " view . )
