it 's not the first time bridesmaids guests have picked the same outfit all over the world , but it 's a little more complicated than it did in the last few years . the new york times reports that julia mammone , 19 , posted a second photo of herself wearing the same dress to a wedding as a stranger was a great starter . " my worst nightmare being dressed the same as someone else . i would literally go home and change , " she wrote . " that post alone drew more than 10,000 comments with friends tagging each other with memories of similar , if not such large-scale , faux pas . " the photo was taken by debbie speranza , who dubbed herself and her friends " # backupbridesmaids . " the telegraph reports that the image was shared more than 90,000 times , and speranza 's friend laura frazer , who says she was on " such a high " $ 160 " <unk> " that both women just decided to get on and embrace the day before the wedding . but the bbc points out that the photo is n't exactly the kind of thing you 'd like to think about , but that does n't mean you 're going to have to wait a long time .
