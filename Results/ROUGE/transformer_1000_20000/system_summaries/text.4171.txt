the supreme court 's decision to overturn the affordable care act is a matter of contention , writes doyle mcmanus at the washington post . it 's a " surprise to democrats and to mainstream scholars , " he writes in the new york times . " the court is not going to overturn it . " the decision is expected to be unanimous , he writes , because the court 's arguments are n't unanimous , and it 's not clear whether antonin scalia or antonin scalia will be unanimous . " if the commerce clause does n't apply to the constitution , it should be a government of limited and enumerated powers , " writes denniston . " it 's time to argue that the federal government does n't have the power to impose the individual mandate . " the ruling was n't unanimous in the decision , but the editors disagree . " it was the first time that congress had decided to uphold a law requiring most americans to have health insurance under congress , " says the editorial . " the only thing that would be the case is that it would n't be the right decision . "
