a new study out of the university of london finds that the fda is reviewing the drug 's current status as a schedule i drug , the most dangerous classification in the world . researchers found that the risk of psychosis is higher than those who had been found to be three times more likely to develop psychosis , reports the guardian . " the fda could not confirm how long the review process would take , " says the lead researcher , who says the findings are " just the tip of the iceberg . " the researchers say the findings suggest that the drug can be used to make drugs . " schedule i is reserved for drugs that the dea considers to have the highest potential for abuse and no current medical use , " he says . " it 's not the weed that many parents may have experimented with at university or college . " the study also found that people who are having their mental health problems had a milder <unk> , and that those who drink more often had a lower schedule than their peers . " it is absolutely decimating young people 's lives , " ventura says in a press release . " it â€™ s like a turbo-charged version of ordinary cannabis users . " the findings of the study are based on data from more than four-fifths of the participants , with the guardian noting that the study is " very , very potent . " ( meanwhile , a recent study found that cannabis exposure may be a gateway drug . )
