the kentucky county clerk who stirred national attention for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples has been appointed to the state 's highest court , the washington post reports . w. mitchell , who sits in barren and metcalfe counties , says he believes allowing a " practicing homosexual " to adopt would " under no circumstance " promote the best interest of the child , he says . " it 's a matter of time . " the order , which nance says is not fit to fulfill his duties as a judge , is " based on my conscience , " per wkyt . " i do n't know what to do , " says the judge . " i think it 's going to happen . " the judge , however , says it 's not clear whether the judge will recuse himself from any cases involving gay parents , calling his decision " odious . " but nance says the decision was " odious , " and that the judge 's decision was made in four cases of rape , incest , rape , and rape . he says the law was n't applied because it was on them , and that it was n't the case . " it was not the first time i 've ever seen , " he says . " i 've never seen anything like this before . " but the post notes that nance has n't commented on the controversy .
