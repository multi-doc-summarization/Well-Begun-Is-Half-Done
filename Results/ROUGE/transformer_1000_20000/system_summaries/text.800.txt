a new study out of the university of vienna finds that microplastics in the oceans have been found in the ocean . the researchers looked at eight people from finland , italy , and poland , and found that those who ate microplastics were more likely to eat , reports nature world news . in a study published in the journal nature , the researchers found that microplastics are more common in the creatures ' bodies than they did in the first place , reports the guardian . they found that the microplastics tend to be more common , and they tend to eat hydrated feet , reports phys.org . " this is the first study in the history of human health , " says lead researcher dr. philipp schwabl schwabl . " it 's very concerning . " in the study , the scientists found that they had n't been able to eat microplastics , but they did n't eat well , and that 's what they found . the researchers say they 've found microplastics in their mouths , as well as the microbes themselves , and the microplastics are common in human cells , reports live science . the researchers also found that phytoplankton eat more quickly , while the creatures are susceptible to eating hydrated cells . " we have a lot more energy to eat than a minute , and we 've got a lot of <unk> , " schwabl says in a press release . " we 've never seen anything like this before . " the study 's co-author says the findings are " very exciting " and " reeks of desperation . " ( meanwhile , scientists are trying to figure out microplastics that are nutritious . )
