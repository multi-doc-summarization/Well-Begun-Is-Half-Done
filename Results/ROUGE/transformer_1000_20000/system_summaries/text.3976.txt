the son of deputy leader joseph kony has named his son in the lord 's resistance army , reports the guardian . the ugandan president , who is believed to have spent much of his life in the country 's central african republic of the congo , says he has an added responsibility for the killings . " previously the son was in charge of the group providing security to the father , " he says . " the role of the son is an indication that has lost contact with most of his commanders . " the ugandan war secretary-general says kony 's son , yoweri museveni , has been killed by snipers in aleppo since 2005 , and has been seen as a prisoner of war crimes against humanity including murder and sexual slavery . the rebels have been trying to figure out the motive for the 2013 killings , which occurred in uganda , but they have n't been able to track down the killings , the new york times reports . " we have no room for complacency , " says an army official . " we are not going to be a war zone . "
