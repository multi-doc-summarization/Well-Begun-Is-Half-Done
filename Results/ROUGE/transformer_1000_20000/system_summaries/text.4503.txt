uganda 's parliament on friday adopted an anti-homosexuality bill that would have introduced the death penalty for anyone caught in homosexual acts for a second time , the bbc reports . " this is a victory for uganda . i am glad the parliament has voted against evil , " archbishop desmond tutu said in a statement , noting that the bill " is because of those values that members of parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks . " he added that the law provided for the green light by president yoweri museveni , himself a devout christian christian . " the bill was dropped from the final version of the bill , but it 's not clear whether it will be used to punish gay men , the guardian reports . " we are a god-fearing nation , we value life in a holistic way . " tutu , the head of uganda 's ethics and integrity act , says the bill will " be saved from abuse and molestation . " he says it will " hold of all those encouraging others to become homosexuals or lesbians . anybody found practising , recruiting for or using materials to promote homosexuality , is a minor or has hiv .
