gap has gone back on plans to revamp the logo of the new yorker logo , but it 's not the first time gap in the eye for malcolm crowdsourcing . " yeah , i do n't care about gap 's logo . if you 've missed it and i would n't blame you if you had gap said it was changing its logo to a new one that nobody has taken , " gap tells the wall street journal . " it got rage against the machine to number one in the music charts and now it 's taken on the high street . and malcolm thinks social media ca n't bring social change , " he says , adding that the revolution will not be tweeted . " anyone who ’ s claiming that sending a tweet by itself is activism , that ’ s ludicrous . " the logo , which the journal sees as a " salad cream-style publicity stunt , " does n't sound like a journalist from traditional media trying to make a new tool for the new logo . " i think it 's time to tell the truth , " the co-founder of facebook tells the wsj . " it 's the reason why i have n't bothered writing about so far . "
