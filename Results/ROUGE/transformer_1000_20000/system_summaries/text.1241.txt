a new study out of brazil is lending credence to the idea that the ayahuasca brew contains " magic mushrooms . " that 's the conclusion of a study published from the huffington post , which found that the <unk> ayahuasca , a type of ayahuasca vine , is the first to respond to the detrimental effects of depression . the study , published in revista de psiquiatria , also found that people who eat the ayahuasca were more likely to die prematurely than those who did n't eat it , the guardian reports . the study 's lead author , jaime hallak , calls the study " a significant step forward " and says the findings are " very troubling . " the researchers , who studied the effects of the ayahuasca term , say they 've been studying more than a dozen times more times over the past decade . the researchers say that while the study reinforces the point of how the gene works , it 's not clear how much it will be , but the researchers note that there 's no evidence that depression is associated with depression , anxiety , and mental health issues . the researchers also say that the study is needed to reduce the risk of ayahuasca , meditation , and other health effects . " we have to do everything we can to achieve , and that 's what we can do , " one researcher says . " we do n't have a problem with it . " ( another study found that ayahuasca is unsafe . )
