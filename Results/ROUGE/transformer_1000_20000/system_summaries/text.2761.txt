the greenland ice sheet melted at a faster rate this month than at any other time , according to a new nasa study . the satellite images , published in the guardian , show signs of thaw , droughts , and droughts , have been captured by three satellites , the guardian reports . " this was so extraordinary that at first i questioned the result : was this real or was it due to a data error ? " nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory says in a press release . it 's not clear how much latitude the ice sheet will be , but it 's still unclear whether it will be a mistake . nasa says it 's looking into whether the melt will be caused by climate change , and it has n't yet been determined whether the ice will continue to melt . " i think it 's fair to say that this is unprecedented , " says jay zwally of nasa 's goddard space flight center , where the guardian notes that the melt could cause a " devastating blow " to greenland , which has been the largest ever recorded history of climate change in the history of the year . the guardian says that while greenland 's surface temperatures have fallen over the past few years , it has been a long way for greenland to see a spike in melting glaciers .
