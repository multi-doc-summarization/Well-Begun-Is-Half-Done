a new study finds that the oil and gas industry are likely to have triggered a major increase in the number of earthquakes in the us , the bbc reports . researchers found that more than 2,500 earthquakes have occurred around the small town of jones , oklahoma , and oklahoma in recent years . " if a fault is close to failure , the amount that the pressure is going up at these locations in our model is enough to push them over the edge , " says the lead author of the study . " the typical ratio is five to one . we 're seeing much higher ratios , in the hundreds , at the beginning of the well . " the study found that the quakes have been linked to a near doubling in volumes of wastewater generated by wastewater disposal wells , the guardian reports . the researchers say that while the quakes are far more worrisome than the magnitude of the quake , it 's not just for hydraulic fracturing , but also to squeeze more oil out of conventional wells . " there is a high ratio of water to oil , " one researcher says .
