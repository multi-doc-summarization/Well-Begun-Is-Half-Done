hundreds of people gathered in fort wayne , indiana , for a wedding ceremony marking the first virgin mary girl to be canonized . the bride , jessica hayes , is a high school theology teacher , reports cbs news . " i had been praying about it for years , trying to seek god 's will for my life and not really finding it in any of the paths that i sought before , " she tells cbs news . " it was really a consideration of which things brought me the most joy and where my greatest happiness was . " the consecrated high school is not the same as a nun . hayes will still live her life as a lay person , but she 's currently the only consecrated recording in her diocese , reports the los angeles times . the 38-year-old was marrying her groom , jesus christ . she became the fort wayne-south diocese of canon law in 25 years , and she has worked for the church to make sure that i was well-covered in a way that still shows the beauty of a bride . i wanted my shoulders to be covered , and i would have to lie prostrate before the altar .
