" i will take my life today around , " gillian bennett tells ctv news . " it is time . dementia is taking its toll and i have nearly lost me .

" i just sat there and held her hand , " she wrote . " i was absolutely floored by the fact that she was not able to do that . " bennett , a doctor at canada 's expense , says that while she 's not assisted , she does n't have a " living will that says how and under what circumstances they would like to die . " i can live or vegetate for perhaps 10 years in the world , " bennett writes in her blog post . " my hope is that these institutions will continue to transform themselves , and that the medical profession will mandate , through sensitive and appropriate protocols , the administration of a lethal dose to end the suffering of a terminally ill patient , in accordance with her living will . " the letter , which has been shared more than 100 times , says it will be " a financial burden on the canadian healthcare system , and a chore for her loved ones . " " i do not have all the answers , but i do think i 'm raising questions that need to be raised , " says bennett . " yet facing death is thoroughly interesting
