hillary clinton won monday night 's presidential debate in iowa , but it was n't until much of a surprise , according to a national tracking poll released wednesday . the survey found that 56 % of american adults felt that the debate changed their view of clinton in a positive way , compared to 19 % who did a better job than trump in the first of their three televised debates . " you sit back and you hear how well she did in the debate . i don ’ t think she did well at all. ” the poll , which showed 42 % of independents and 22 % supported trump , also found that trump did n't appear to have immediately boosted her support among likely voters . " the only thing i can do is change , " trump said in a statement . " it 's not a matter of time . it 's time for me to do something about it . " the washington post reports that clinton 's performance was " unprepared , became unhinged and was incoherent " among those who are expected to take part in the nov. 8 general election , and the new york times reports that it 's unclear how many voters will be able to vote for clinton , who has been seen as a crucial test of trump 's poise and the likelihood of winning the white house is still unclear .
