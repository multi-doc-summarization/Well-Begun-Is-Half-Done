the champagne harvest is down 40 % this year , and it 's the lowest harvest in at least four decades , according to a french agriculture ministry report . that 's because , as the guardian puts it , " the french grape harvest has been falling all over the past year . " that 's why the edmonton journal reports it 's been dubbed " <unk> , " which means it 's a " festive season . " it 's not clear how many grapes are used to make champagne and it is made from a mixture of grapes from several years ago to hail storms and fungus . but it 's also not all bad news for france , where the country 's agriculture ministry says it 's " aware of the decline since there 's a surplus left over from waning demand in the us and south america . " but it does n't seem to be a bleak one , with a greenpeace rep noting that " the total amount of champagne in the world is going to have to be reduced to 1.25 % of the global population . " the guardian points out that the <unk> champagne market has grown in the past 40 years , with manufacturers such as champagne and gourmet flavors like <unk> and <unk> , and champagne bottles may be grown in a <unk> environment . " we have a lot of people who are n't going to eat this stuff , " he says . " i do n't want to eat it . "
