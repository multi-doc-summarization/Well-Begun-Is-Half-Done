the international bottled water association , ever sensitive to criticism that it 's wasting resources , has commissioned its first ever study to figure out how much water goes into producing one of its biggest water bottles . that 's less than 0.1 % of the beverage , which requires 2.02 liters of soda to make a bottle of water , reports the los angeles times . " this , the bottled water industry says , is evidence that its product is n't so bad , " says chris hogan , who warns that " bottled water products are extremely efficient in terms of water use compared to some other packaged beverages . " in a press release , ercin notes that three of the water 's <unk> water footprint includes all used in production , including the water used for packaging . " packaging makes a significant footprint , " hogan says . " and you need water to make the paper , too , he adds . " still , the amount of water going into making the bottle could be up to six or seven times what 's inside the bottle . drilling for oil to make plastic , it turns out , is the greediest , guzzling .
