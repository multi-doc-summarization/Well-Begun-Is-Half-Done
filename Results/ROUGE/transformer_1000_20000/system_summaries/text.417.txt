a new study out of the university of oregon finds that women are less likely to be more inclined to cheat than their male counterparts , reports the new york times . researchers looked at eight men and nine women who were asked to flex their foot against a suite of sensors . the results , published in the school of health and exercise sciences , were found to be stronger than men during isometric muscle tests . " we know from previous research that for events like ultra-trail running , males may complete them faster but females are less tired by the end , " assistant professor brian dalton says in a press release . " and the answer is pretty definitive : women can outlast men by a wide margin . " dalton says he would expect similar results for other groups and his team . " if ever an ultra-ultra-marathon is developed , women may well dominate in that arena , " he says . " but it 's not all about competition . " he adds that the findings are " consistent with what has been observed elsewhere , " and that " there 's no battle at all , " per the washington post . the study also found that women who have suffered muscle endurance problems tend to have a better sense of humor , too , and the researchers say that while they do n't have enough training , they do posit a " <unk> " explainer of the study .
