" there 's got to be a level of discourse that can rise above what happened last night , " he told politico . " it was undignified , unedifying . i knew what we were going to be getting into with him . " he added , " i know about his background and his reputation , so i know he 's kind of shock . " morgan , who started the white house petition to call morgan a " big , long rant " about gun control , said that he had been far more vocal about the 9/11 attacks , and that he was n't a fan of morgan , the new york daily news reports . " sometimes it 's better to let somebody have the rope they need to tie themselves in knots , " morgan said , adding that the " 1776 " of morgan 's petition was " governed by logic-leaping deductions and heedless pronouncements , " the los angeles times reports . morgan , creator of the alex jones show , says he has no intention of doing anything nefarious , but he does n't feel threatened by him . he says he does have a " huge online presence " in the past , but that " we have a tendency to spur heavy gun sales and ammunition sales .
