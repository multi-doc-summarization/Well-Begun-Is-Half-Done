the five-second rule is a lot bigger than you thought , but a new study suggests that it 's a good thing to do , reports the chicago tribune . researchers at clemson university crunched the numbers and found that salmonella and other bacteria can live up to four weeks on the floor , and it turns out that the bacteria had been transferred from tabletops and floors to the food within five seconds , reports nbc news . the upshot is that the food is not an accurate guide when it comes to dry surfaces , but the gist of the story is that it is n't the first study to prove it . " my students and i have researched the five-second-rule and published the results in the journal of applied microbiology . we did this as a creative inquiry project to learn how research is done , " says lead researcher paul dawson . " i 'm a food scientist at the food science and human nutrition department . " dawson , who stirred up the study , says the findings are based on " what the data showed us about that original question , " reports usa today . " it 's not true and we 've proven it , it 's well , bologna . " he says that while he does n't know how much the bacteria came from , he does think it 's safe to eat , and that does n't mean it was n't in the bathroom , he says , adding that the findings do n't necessarily establish causation . ( meanwhile , a study found that a lot of people are diabetic , too . )
