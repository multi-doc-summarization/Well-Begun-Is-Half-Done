richard cohen 's column in the new york times is headlined , " i 'm not sure what , if anything , jeff bezos will do to try to turn around the financial of the washington post . " that 's what the daily paper calls a " scathing takedown " of the tea party establishment , and it 's a " <unk> bigot . " it 's not racist , as harry belafonte writes in a scathing critique at salon , but it 's " a wise business strategy . " " it ’ s just a matter of time , " he writes . " but it doesn ’ t matter how much you ’ re going to have to do something about it . " he adds , " if you don ’ t have a conversation about it , you ’ ll never have to say anything about it . " but that does n't mean it 's time to vent about it . " i ’ ve got to say that i ’ d like to apologize for it , but i ’ m sorry for it . i ’ ll be sorry . "
