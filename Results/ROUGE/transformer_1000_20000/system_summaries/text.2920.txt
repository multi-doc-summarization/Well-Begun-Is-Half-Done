ups says it 's making its move into more than a quarter of its delivery vans . the company says the <unk> drone , which was launched from the roof of a truck about a quarter mile away to a blueberry farm in tampa , fla. , returned to the van , where it had moved down the road to allow its driver to make another package weighing up to 10 pounds , reports wired . the octocopter drones will be able to use a 30-minute flight time limit the drone 's payload , which can be seen here . " it has implications for future deliveries , especially in rural locations where our package cars often have to travel miles to make a single delivery , " ups ceo john wallace says in a press release . " imagine a triangular area where the drone stops are miles apart by road . " ups says the system is different from its other work thus far , and the company 's network more efficient while reducing emissions , reports venturebeat . the drones will also be used to deliver packages to extra remote locations , but they wo n't be allowed to fly over any line of sight . the drone will be used for the first time in england in december , when the company plans to launch a drone in the hopes of setting up a new delivery system , reports cnbc .
