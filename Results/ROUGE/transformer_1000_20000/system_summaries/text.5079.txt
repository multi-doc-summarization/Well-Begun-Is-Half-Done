the washington monument is in the midst of a " display of fireworks , " but it 's not the only one that 's been used in china , where the us and china have passed a law requiring flags flown by the military to be made in america . that 's the conclusion that the country 's executive director of the american fireworks standards association says it 's " very , very labor-intensive to make fireworks . basically everything is still made by the chinese government , " he says in a statement . " we have no idea what to do about this , but we do n't have a problem with it . " the country is importing $ 213 million in annual sales from pyrotechnic exports to the united states . it 's a big deal for chinese imports , which are used in big , public shows , and social media . " we 're not going to get a lot of people to buy this year , " says a spokesman for china 's environmental and safety commission . " we do not have a lot to do with it . "
