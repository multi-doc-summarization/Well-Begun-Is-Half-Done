new zealand researchers say they 've found a way to get rid of the ever-growing rat populations of mice . the wwf says they 've uncovered a correlation between the two species of sea bird , which is the largest ever found in the world , the bbc reports . " it demonstrated how hard it is to catch that very first rat as it arrives on an island or so , " says the lead researcher . " there was a lot of literature on controlling and killing a single rodent , which turns out to be rather important in efforts to eradicate a species . " the study , published in the journal plos one , found that mice from the university of auckland and new zealand were more likely to eat on nearby pest-free islands off the coast of new zealand than previously thought , the guardian reports . the researchers say that while they have n't been able to eat the mouse , they are n't sure why the mouse is responsible for the problem . " i felt rather morose about the prospects for my phd , " he says , adding that the study 's lead author suggests that the mouse may have been responsible for its effects . the study also found that the mice had been written about tracking the mouse 's movements , and that they were amazed to discover that the rat had been wiped out . " we have n't seen anything like this before , but we 've got to see what is going on , " sage says . " we do n't know how to do this . " ( meanwhile , scientists are trying to figure out why the rat is going extinct .
