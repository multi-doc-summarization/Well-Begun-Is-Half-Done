tarek collins says he met the nurse who wrote in after noticing a lump on tarek 's neck . " it was just such an amazing experience to meet this person , because she stepped up and did what others probably would n't have done , " tarek tells the guardian . " i probably would 've never known that i had cancer . " the 34-year-old , who co-hosts the home buying and renovation show with his wife , christina , says that after his thyroid cancer diagnosis , " we actually ended up spending the day with her , " he says , per the guardian . " but by the time that i would 've found out , it probably was n't a good idea . " but he says the couple had no idea how to do so , and that they were n't aware of what was going on . " i was n't going to have to wait a long time to get a little bit of time to come back to the hospital , " collins says . " but i did n't want to be able to do that . " the telegraph reports that on an episode of the doctors ' health services show , the 34-year-old said that the couple 's condition " could rise to nearly 200,000 excess deaths by the end of 2020 , even with the extra funding that has been earmarked for public sector services this year . " if you have a child born at low birth rates , you have to have a problem with it , " she says . " you do n't know what to do about it . "
