it 's been a rough week for children in 2050 , but a new essay by the new york times raises the possibility that parents of kids separated from their families for reasons of poverty , disability and discrimination . " the sad truth remains that my reaction to that picture could stand as a metaphor for the attitude that has enabled the unjustifiable of 8 million children around this world to take place with little outrage or comment , " writes emily shire at slate . " the truth is that the vast majority of these children have parents that could care for them . they are not orphans . most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them , or because of a lack of local education and health facilities , especially for children with special needs . " read the article . or at salon , emily <unk> writes that the essay was " <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , " but it was n't enough to argue that the kids were " <unk> , " and that it " would n't have been the most humane thing i 've ever seen . "
