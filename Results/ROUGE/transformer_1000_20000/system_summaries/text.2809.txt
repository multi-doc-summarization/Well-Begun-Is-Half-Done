a new study out of new york suggests that the triplets were conceived without the help of a rare skull , but they were n't expecting it to happen . " you could tell that their heads were a little bit malformed , " says the study 's lead author . " it was really extremely scary thinking about your 8- or 9-week-old baby going through surgery. . " the study , published in the journal nature , found that the boys were born in the early stages of pregnancy , and that they had n't been able to form properly , reports the washington post . in fact , it was n't the first time the triplets had gotten a life changing from their parents , who had been at the hospital for a while now . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " amy howard , 38 , tells abc news . " i think they really were in too much pain , but it all turned out great , " she says . " the babies will have to wear helmets for the next few months as they recover , but then they will lead normal lives . " the researchers say they 've found a correlation between brain swelling and swelling in the brain , and they 've seen a slight uptick in the number of skulls shown to be <unk> . " i do n't know how to do this , but i 'm going to cause brain damage , " he says . " that was my main concern , was it . " ( meanwhile , another study found that a woman 's brain had a brain tumor . )
