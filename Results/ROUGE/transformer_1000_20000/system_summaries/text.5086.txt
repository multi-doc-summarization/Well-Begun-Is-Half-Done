if you 're looking for a hot nose , you 're not alone . a new study finds that anxiety will see the tip of the nose heat up the nose . researchers from the university of granada say they 've dubbed the newly-found phenomenon , discovered by using thermal imaging cameras on volunteers , reports the guardian . the researchers found that the nose increases or temperature changes in the chest and genital areas , and that 's not the case . " the more activity in the insular cortex ( the higher the visceral feeling ) , so there is a large correlation between the activity of this structure and the magnitude of the temperature change , " lead researcher emilio milán says in a press release . " this is the thermal footprint for flamenco , although each type of dance has its own . " the researchers say that while the temperature in their buttocks can be seen in men and women , they do n't know how much they are . " 'when someone dances flamenco , the lowers and it rises in their forearms , " milán says . the researchers ' lead author says the findings are based on scientific journals , but that the temperature changes are n't necessarily indicative of the aerobic body temperature changes , the guardian reports . the study also found that people who lie about their feelings , telling a lie doesn ’ t , of course , make your nose grow like pinocchio ’ s .
