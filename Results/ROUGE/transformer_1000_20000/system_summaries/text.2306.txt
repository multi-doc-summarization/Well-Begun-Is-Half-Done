if you 're looking for a samsung tv show , you 're not going to have to worry about it . a new study by the guardian finds that samsung 's <unk> tvs dropped from 70 to 39 within a minute of the start of the test . the study , published in 2011 , found that the brightness of the lcd live firm 's lcd live energy was " causing the discrepancy . " the findings suggest that samsung has a technology to recognise when it is tested , and that 's not normal , it 's an anomaly , " says lead author kay <unk> . " it is a standard out-of-the-box feature , which is switched on when the customer takes delivery of their tv in standard mode , " she adds . the study also found that samsung had been using the tvs to cheat emissions tests on real-world networks , and it was n't the first time the test had been used to test the tvs , which were used to be used for budgetary assessments . " we do n't have any evidence to back up the accusation that samsung used software to manufacture the tvs during normal use and had nothing to do with the testing process , " kay wrote in a press release . " that 's the effect of a general energy feature . "
