al gore is n't considering a run for hillary clinton , but it 's a doozy of a story out of the new york times . in a phone interview with politico , gore says he 's " not saying there 's nobody out there fantasizing about it , but i haven ’ t heard anything and i ’ d be pretty insulted if there were a group of gore meeting and i wasn ’ t invited . i just don ’ t think this is on his mind. ” he says he was " getting the old gang together . " " there ’ s no truth to it . he ’ s laser-focused on solving the climate crisis , " he says . " i ’ m not going to run for president in 2016 . " the story is headlined , " democrats talking to other democrats , " and " have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running . " gore , meanwhile , insists that he does n't believe clinton will jump into the 2016 presidential race , but that does n't mean he will be able to step in : " if i do n't know what i am going to do , it ’ s a path financially and politically , " gore says . " it is a rigged system . "
