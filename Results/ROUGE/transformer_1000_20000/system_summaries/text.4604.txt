" i think the yazidis , " says human rights lawyer nadia oxford-educated . " it â€™ s just a matter of time . " in a statement to the new york times , clooney accuses the men of being " unforgettable " and " rigging " their ties to the icc . he says the yazidis have been forced to take part in an effort to keep them out of their homes , but they 've been told they wo n't be allowed to return to the us . the yazidis are still being held , and clooney says he 's not sure how to do so . he says he has no plans to do anything to prevent them from being stabbed to death by isis , and he wants to keep it in place . clooney says she has no idea what to do , but she says she does n't believe it will be a copycat of what she sees as a treasonous threat to the yazidis . meanwhile , a change.org petition has been set up to help organize the icc .
