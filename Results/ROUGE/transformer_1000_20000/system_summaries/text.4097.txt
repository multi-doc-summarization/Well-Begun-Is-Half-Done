a new study out of the university of michigan finds that teens with higher amounts of insulin resistance have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes than their peers . the study , published in the journal pediatrics , found that the higher levels of bpa levels in the urine of 766 adolescents ages 12 to 19 were more likely to die prematurely than those who had n't been vaccinated . the researchers looked at the effects of genes related to insulin resistance , and found that in a press release , the researchers found that phthalates were found to be linked to obesity and insulin resistance in adult males . the researchers also found that people with insulin keys had a higher phthalate rate than their counterparts , and that they did n't find an association between the two groups and their families . the study also looked at data culled from the endocrine , which was used to gauge insulin resistance . " in laboratory studies , phthalates have been found in the same frequency as the <unk> , " the lead author of the study tells the new york times . " this is not a cause-and-effect , " says the lead researcher . " it 's not just about tobacco use . " the study 's lead author , dr. leonardo trasande , says the findings are " very troubling " and that " the influence peddling industry is not going to have to be replicated in the future . " ( meanwhile , a study found that bpa levels significantly lower than the other group . )
