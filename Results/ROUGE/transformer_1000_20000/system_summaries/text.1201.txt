" the question is worth asking and that we should be asking ourselves , because this is a child 's school record , and it 's not something to be taken lightly , " says mary anne duggan , an assistant research professor at arizona state university , per cbs news . " is it really fair to characterize this behavior in this context , in this circumstance , as sexual misconduct ? " the boy 's mother , dysart , says he 's not sure how much they could understand of any of that . " i do n't think that 's what i do , " she says . " that 's a question . " the district 's superintendent says the incident raises serious questions about the merits of the school 's handling of the issue , but the district does n't say whether it will investigate or file a complaint . the district says it 's investigating the infraction because it does n't have jurisdiction over the alleged infraction .
