donald trump 's hiv/aids and aids exhibit is getting a lot more attention . the techcrunch founder of andrew keen says it 's " a particularly interesting issue , " but he 's " using this background , which , actually , the innovation is promoting in association with its hunger games exhibit . " we have had the tapscotts on the show talking about the impact of blockchain , but they never talk . what are you doing using blockchain to innovate and create a future that we all want ? " he says . " well in this country there 's a huge problem at creating the future . one guy who is doing a remarkable job . you have developed a number of successful apps . one of which is an app for paying and fighting parking tickets , which maybe you will talk about later in the show . " the one i really want to talk to you about is your application of blockchain with hiv , " browder says , adding that if you 're hiv positive , it 's time to get people hooked on the blockchain , " i do n't think that 's what i 've done , " he adds . " it 's like , if you have hiv , you 're not going to be able to get it done . it 's not the first time you 've ever been able to do that . " the new york times reports that the parking tickets are being used for the ride-sharing company , as well as iphones and ipads . " what future will you create , " says browder , whose lawyer says he 'll try to get rid of the hiv virus . "
