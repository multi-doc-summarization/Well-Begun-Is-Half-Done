flint 's lead problem is getting worse . the state 's department of agriculture says it is investigating the death of a dog in flint , mich. , on friday , reports the detroit free press . the culprit is that the dogs were drinking flint water , and it 's not clear how much the lead was in their systems . " there is no regular testing for lead , " says dr. james averill . " what we do is we rely on the veterinarians who have the boots on the ground that are interacting with their clients and looking at the patients in front of them . " the dogs are at a higher risk of finding high lead levels in the area , and they 're not allowed to get a filter in place , reports wfts . the dogs have n't been identified , but they have n't yet been notified of any such incident . " we 're dealing with lead toxicity , we 've usually seen a new instance for us , " averill says . the agency says it 's investigating whether flint 's water is contaminated , but it 's possible that the dog could be contaminated with lead poisoning . " for us when we are concerned or suspect a lead may be possible , they let us know at that time and then we work with them moving forward . "
