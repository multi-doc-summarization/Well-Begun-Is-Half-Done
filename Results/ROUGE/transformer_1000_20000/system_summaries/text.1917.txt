" i don ’ t think that ’ s america , " he said , per the hill . he added that he 's " reserving my ticket to get out of here if he ’ s running for president , " adding , " i ’ m not going to pay 90 % of my income to that guy . " he added , per politico , that he has no plans to leave the country if he becomes a president . " i do n't want it to be a president , but it ’ s time for me to move , ” he added . “ i don , you ’ re going to ireland . and they already know what ’ s going on in the last two years . " he also promised that he would be " a trump presidency " if he does n't want the president , and that would be much more than it would have been .
