" the dea sent a memo saturday saying that the president " did not want to advance any sort of agenda , nor did he believe that his agents would mistreat defendants . still , he listed " core values for agents to follow , including : rule of law , respect and compassion , service , accountability , and courage and diversity . " " this is how we treat those whom we encounter in our work : victims , witnesses , and defendants , " he said , per usa today . the memo sent acting dea chief chuck rosenberg to offer a " strong response " to trump 's criticism of police violence . " i believe that he was making a joke at the time , " trump said . " like when you guys put somebody in the car and you â€™ re protecting their head . i said , ' you can take the hand away , ok ? ' " he added , per the washington post . he added that the dea did n't tolerate " rough suspects " in the wake of trump 's remarks .
