" that 's the conclusion that the fed is raising interest rates by one-quarter point three times this year , with a fourth increase likely for december as monetary policymakers seek to credit demand . " how the hell do you compete with that ? " he asked . " i have a hot economy going , " he said , per nbc news . " the biggest risk to the economy was not tariffs , said trump , nor an escalating trade war . " he added that he " maybe " regretted nominating powell to the position , noting that " i do n't believe that the president will do that . " the washington post , meanwhile , reports that the white house has been pushing hard for the fed to re-examine its policies . the journal reports trump has been trying to figure out how to deal with saudi arabia over the death of journalist jamal khashoggi , who is expected to remain in the process . the hill reports that trump has previously expressed confidence in the fed 's decision to cut interest rates from the fed , which he sees as a " destabilizing effect " in the wake of the 2008 election .
