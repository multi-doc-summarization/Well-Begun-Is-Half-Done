a california man shot and killed a shark last week off the coast of mexico 's guadalupe island , abc news reports . " these awesome sharks are biting at large chunks of tuna tied to a rope . when a great white shark lunges and bites something , it is temporarily blinded . they also can not swim backwards , it thrust forward and broke the metal rail of the cage . he ended up outside the cage , looking down on two great white sharks , " the diver says . " what might appear to be an aggressive great white . " the shark is a very experienced dive instructor , remained calm , and when the shark thrashed back outside , it was most likely confused and not able to swim backwards . so this shark lunged at the bait , accidentally hit the side of it . " i love you but you better be ... careful when you go again , " he says , adding that he plans to stay in touch with the other divers . " just like , the shark 's love of shark-infested waters has n't been shaken . "
