a man who lived about 40,000 years ago has been found groomed by the neanderthal dna of neanderthals in europe , according to a new study . the researchers found that one of the very first modern humans that is known from europe had a neanderthal ancestor just four to six generations back in his family tree , the guardian reports . the study , published in nature , found that interbreeding with neanderthals was a " pioneer population " and " carries more neanderthal dna than any present-day or ancient human seen to date . " the finding was n't a surprise , however , because it was n't the first time the study found that neanderthals were more likely to have lived in the middle east than previously known , reports the new york times . the researchers say the neanderthal ancestor , which was found in a cave in 2002 , reinforces the point that interbreeding occurred in europe after 43,000 years of research , " the lead researcher tells the times . " it was the largest study in history , " he says . " it 's very exciting that europe has not been occupied by the same species ever since the first waves of migration of modern humans into europe .
