a new study out of the university of michigan suggests that colon cancer is a " wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of cancers are occurring in young people , " the lead researcher says in a press release . the study looked at 258,000 patients with colorectal cancer , and found that more than one in 10 colon cancers will be associated with either regional or distant malignancies , reuters reports . " colorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly , " says dr. samantha hendren , whose study is published in the cancer registry of the national cancer insitute . the study found that younger people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and the lymph nodes are mixed with stool , no matter your age . the study also found that the risk of colon cancer doubled to 50 % over the past 50 years . the researchers say that while they have n't yet been vaccinated , they do n't expect to see a link between the mosquito-borne disease and the disease . the study , which looked at vaccination rates in the us between 1998 and 2011 , found that those with tumors were more likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer than those who had n't had a bowel disorder . the researchers also looked at data from more than 100 people diagnosed in the study . the researchers found that in 50 % of the rectal tumors studied , more than half of those who lived with tumors had been found to have tumors removed . ( another study found colon cancer may be tied to colon cancer . )
