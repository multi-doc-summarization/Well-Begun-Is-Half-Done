rick perry 's debate performance in the orlando massacre is getting a lot more attention , but he 's got a lot of laughs , writes chris cillizza in the washington post . " the debate is over , " he writes . " it 's time for the republican nomination to get that education . " " if you say that we should not educate children that have come into our state for no other reason than they ’ ve been brought here by no fault of their own , i don ’ t think that ’ s a problem . " in fact , it 's not the first time the debate has been over , writes ed kilgore at new york . " it ’ s just a matter of time . " but it 's a good night for rick perry , who writes that the debate " is not going to be a bad night for conservatives . " he 's not a fan of perry , but " he does n't think he 's going to have to do that , " writes klein . " but he ’ s going to get a little bit more attention . "
