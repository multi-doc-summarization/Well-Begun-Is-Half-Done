the new jersey department of banking and insurance says it 's investigating a " determination of infertility by a second-class citizen , " the new york times reports . according to a lawsuit filed last week , the plaintiffs say they have " added stress of being treated like a pregnancy to live birth or the inability to conceive after one or two years of unprotected sex . " the suit claims the mandate violates the constitutional rights of nonheterosexual women . " the specific wording of the mandate is particularly egregious and one of the most specific and exclusionary , " says the suit . " it 's a double standard . it discriminates against same-sex couples because they don ’ t have the biological equipment to have a baby the way a pregnancy is not . " the state 's legislature has two bills that propose changing the definition of sexual orientation , but it 's not clear whether it will be implemented , the star-ledger reports . " i ’ m not sure if there ’ s a lot of thought given to the implications of what this would cause and how many new jerseyans it would exclude , " a spokesperson for the plaintiffs tells the times . " it ’ s time to do that . "
