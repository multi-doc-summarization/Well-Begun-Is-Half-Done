jeb bush says he 's " abandoned " by the jeb bush brothers , but he 's not going to have to do so . " jeb ! of course , is the representation of the candidate that would take america by storm , " he tells the washington post , which notes that the trademark application is meant to keep ne'er-do-wells from offering up ! " on cool products like mousepads , money clips and golf towels . " this is a metaphor . jeb ! ( or someone presumably acting on his behalf ) wanted to trademark jeb ! " reads the application , which has been filed by a group aligned with bush to reserve its exclusive right to use the name " lol . " the trademark was n't terribly valuable because there 's not really any money to be made from selling anything with ! on it , " writes russ <unk> in the new york daily news . but it 's not all bad news for bush : " the abandonment of the mark allows anyone to start selling jeb ! stuff without recrimination . " the application also includes an exclamation point in his campaign material in the way that you say " lol " to someone over text even though you can buy lots of jeb ! campaign store , but people clearly are n't buying enough of it .
