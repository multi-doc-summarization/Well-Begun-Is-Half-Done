" the advertising serves two roles : it helps draw in the young , healthy customers who keep overall costs down and it addresses confusion among many people over whether the subsidies that help make affordable to many and obamacare itself still exist in the wake of trump 's actions , " says the editorial director of industry america 's insurance policy center . " the government does not have a problem with it . " the times notes that the company 's advertising budget is now just $ 10 million , with the times noting that it has n't yet been finalized , and that 's not the case for the first time since trump 's inauguration . in a statement , the company says it will " continue to work closely " on the issue . " a decrease of $ 90 million is a big hole to me , " he says . " i think it 's time to get the word out of the equation . " meanwhile , the wall street journal reports that blue cross , san diego , and new york , set their own advertising period last week , has commissioned a tractor trailer to bring insurance consultants out of shopping centers and other neighborhood spots around philadelphia . the journal notes that in the past two weeks , insurers have raised more than $ 1 million over the last few days . the journal also notes that enrollment has increased since last year .
