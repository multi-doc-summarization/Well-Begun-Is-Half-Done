howard klein , the 87-year-old man charged with prostitution in the area of leonard street and broadway avenue , has been arrested for allegedly trying to pick up a prostitute , reports the los angeles times . police say the man , who was arrested for soliciting a prostitution sting , was arrested in one of two operations , including two women , the rest of whom were booked into the kent county jail on july 8 , 2015 , when he allegedly thought he was a lady he 'd seen at church . " he would n't and should n't go to jail and 87 years without involvement in the criminal justice system , in my opinion , earned him a pass , " kent county prosecutor william forsyth says in a press release . " in addition , i am told he struggles to continue to prosecute mr. klein on the ticket he was issued for accosting and soliciting , " forsyth says . " he is 87 years old with absolutely no criminal record . " prosecutors say the case was part of a sting targeting prostitution that has plagued the west side neighborhood . " i could see no compelling reason to continue , " klein tells the times , adding that he had no prior criminal record , he did n't seem to pose a danger to society . he says he was told to dismiss the charges , but that given his age and the fact that he was n't someone else in the church , klein was arrested and charged with indecent exposure .
