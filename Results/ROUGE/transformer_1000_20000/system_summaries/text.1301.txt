the svalbard global seed vault in svalbard , australia , is designed to be a backup for the backups of the world , reuters reports . the vault , built in svalbard with high temperatures and a lot of rainâ€”very unusual rainfall in the svalbard area , was never at risk , but more water than we like . " so we are doing measures to improve and secure the entrance and tunnel , " the director of the norwegian government-led organization tells reuters . " this was no flooding . our original post from friday continues below . " the seeds and the vault have been built into the rock vault since 2008 , when the tunnel was destroyed , the guardian reports . researchers say the tunnel , which had been damaged by water intrusion into the entryway of the vault in 2008 , was built by a norwegian seed storage facility in 2008 . but the vault 's lead author says it 's not the first time the water has leaked into the tunnel . " it is probably not quite the right word to use in this case , " he says . " it 's operated for a little over nine years . "
