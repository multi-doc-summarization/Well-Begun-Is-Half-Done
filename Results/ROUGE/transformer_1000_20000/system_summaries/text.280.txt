new zealand 's ministry of health says cigarettes need to cost $ 100 a packet to make new zealand smoke free , the guardian reports . " people still use heroin , " says a health ministry paper . " it is expensive , cocaine is expensive . so i do n't think people will stop smoking. . " the smoker , who has a whatever-it-takes attitude to the idea of making cigarettes $ 100 per packet , says pumping up the cost of a packet of cigarettes wo n't be smoke-free by 2025 , according to the new york times . the proposal is for prices to increase by around a third every year to reach $ 100 , and the health ministry says it 's looking at a range of policies to stop smoking and huge price hikes . " whether that would be sustainable in terms of the black market , i do not know , " john key , the prime minister says , per the guardian . " it seems like a big step. . " the paper notes that while the price hikes could fuel black market trading , it would cost $ <unk> a year , and that 's not the case for new zealand , where it 's estimated to be worth about $ 1 billion annually . but it 's not all bad news for pharmaceutical companies , who are planning a cheaper program to pay the price of cigarettes in new zealand .
