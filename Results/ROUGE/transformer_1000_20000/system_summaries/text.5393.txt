" by the time the war started , i was against the war . " he added that he would meet with the pope " anytime he wants to deport immigrants and build a wall along the border . " trump 's reply : " i do n't think this is a fight . i think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media . " trump , speaking on condition of anonymity , said he was " n't a politician " at the time of the sept. 11 interview . he said he would n't " question people 's christianity . " " i guess so . you know , i wish the first <unk> it was done correctly , " said trump , who has been in the white house since 1985 . " i think it 's appropriate to question donald trump 's faith , " trump said in the interview . " but i just do n't know why he went in " to iraq , he added , adding that he 's " not christian " if he does n't believe the pope is in the " world of immigrants . "
