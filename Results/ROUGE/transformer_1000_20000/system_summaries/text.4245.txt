if you 're looking for a clean home , you 're not alone . the new york times reports that a new study finds that the number of people born in the us was more likely to be shunned for the state of our bathroom . " letting the house go is in a way letting something deeper go . â€¦ you get a sense of safety in an orderly home , " a researcher tells the times . " it was my responsibility . unfortunately , the notion that women are more driven to keep a clean house because they know their male roommates , i was the one who insisted we clean . i was worried i would be judged for the beef jerky wrappers . " so why does it fall to women ? " it 's not simply physical work , " says a researcher , who says the study reinforces the fact that women will be the first to judged for having a dirty one . " i do n't know how much of it is , " he says . " but i think it 's time to do something about it . " in fact , it 's a good thing for women to do when they 're younger , and that 's not the case . " if you do n't think about it , you should n't be able to do it again , " writes megan mcardle at time . " but if you want to know what it 's like to do , it would n't be a good idea . "
