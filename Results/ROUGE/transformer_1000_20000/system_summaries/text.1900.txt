donald trump is taking a lot of flak for his handling of president obama 's birther balloons , but he 's not going anywhere anytime soon . " i may come back but i ’ ll probably be going back to new york after the dinner , " he told the washington post . " they gave me a big role and i was looking forward i was actually going to tampa right to explain that his long-form birth certificate is a forgery . " he added that he has " provided to the political debate " and that " we ’ ll see what happens over the coming weeks and months . " trump , meanwhile , is taking flak for the " near-constant appeal to beliefs that president obama was n't born in the united states , " politico reports . in a tweet last night , trump slammed the development of a " statesman of the year " and said he would n't " think the republicans should be or can be , they ca n't afford to be politically correct and nice . you have to fight fire with fire . and if they do n't do it , they 're not going to have a good result .
