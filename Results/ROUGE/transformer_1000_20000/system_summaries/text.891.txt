supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh says the supreme court will " never , never be viewed as a partisan institution . " that 's what the washington post calls a " scathing critique " of the senate judiciary committee on tuesday , and the new york times takes a look at what it sees as a " tense moment . " it 's not the first time kavanaugh has invoked the " shakespearean nature of the american judiciary , " the ap reports . " but that was at the end of a marathon day marked by rancorous exchanges between democrats and republicans , including dire democratic fears that he would be president trump 's advocate for the presidency , " writes chris cillizza at the times . " the hearing is a reminder that the president is incapable of addressing the issue , " he writes , adding that " the fact that the senate will be confirmed , perhaps in time for the first day of the new term . " in a piece at politico , amy <unk> writes that kavanaugh 's remarks were " very gracious , " and that the " tone of the conversation " was n't enough to suggest that the supreme justices were unanimous in the hearing . " i think there 's a lot of people who have been going to do that , " she writes . " i do n't know what to do about this . "
