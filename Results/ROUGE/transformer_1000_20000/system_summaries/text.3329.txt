the nsa has launched a new " pro bono " program on behalf of the nsa , the new york times reports . the aclu says it 's looking into the nsa 's surveillance program , which amounts to illegal spying on citizens . " we talk to one of the creators about what they 're trying to achieve , and ask how recording and posting unsuspecting people 's conversations without their consent can be justified . we agreed to withhold his identity at his request . this interview has been edited for clarity and length . why have you asked us not to reveal your identity ? well , our operatives can really complete our mission with much greater efficiency if our identities are not known . are you worried about legal repercussions for yourself and for the project ? no . our agents are not doing anything wrong . they really have nothing to be concerned about and there should be no element of being surprised or hurt by an invasion of privacy . so since we 've heard the overwhelming response to the actions , we figured that we would be sending their feelings towards their government representatives to respond to the nsa â€™ s actions .
