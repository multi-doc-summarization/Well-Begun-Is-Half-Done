robert griffin iii is n't the only one making headlines in the wake of the cincinnati enquirer cancelling his show , but he does n't think he did anything wrong . " robert can certainly take care of himself . nonetheless , i hope that our men and for that matter , my own kids , will never beg for authenticity from someone who can only talk about the things that other people have the courage to do . people need to be held accountable for the offensive things that they say. " he added , per the new york daily news , that he 's " uneducated and silly , " adding that he has " no regrets " about the comments , but that it 's not the first time he has been suspended from the nfl , and he 's not alone . in a statement , espn 's rob parker said he was " appalled " by the criticism , and that " we have no doubt that this was a season of silence . " but he added that he does not believe the comments were inappropriate or insensitive , " but that does n't mean the topic still keeps coming up . " it ’ s not the only thing i ’ ve ever heard about , " he said . " it was a matter of time , and it was like , 'ok , what ’ s going on ? ' "
