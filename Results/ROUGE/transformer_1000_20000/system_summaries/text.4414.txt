a bill that would lower the voting age for district residents from 18 to 16 cleared a hurdle : the nation 's capital would become the first municipality in the country to allow minors to vote in all elections , the new york times reports . " many 16-year-olds shoulder responsibilities and burdens , " council member charles allen tells wtop . " this bill will enfranchise the district â€™ s young people and bring their voices into the political process . they pay taxes , they have jobs and they drive on our city , " he says , adding that " they do have skin in the game in their communities . " wtop reports that the bill was passed through the committee on the judiciary and public safety on a vote of 3-0 , and it 's expected to take up the bill later this month . wtop reports the bill will be placed on the agenda of the nov. 13 city council vote , and the full council will vote on the measure . wtop reports it 's not clear whether the bill passes in a final council vote . the bill would require a full senate vote on whether to vote for a final vote , but it would be the first time the country has voted to do so .
