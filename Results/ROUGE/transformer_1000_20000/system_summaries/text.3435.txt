lady gaga ’ s performance at the oscars is not just a metaphor , but she ’ s not happy about it . “ i ’ ve never been more proud of you than i am today . ' something i have kept a secret for so long that i was more ashamed of than anything , became the thing the women in my life were the most proud of . and not just any women , the ones i look up to the most , ” she tells the new york daily news . “ i was too ashamed . too afraid . and it took me a long time to even admit it to myself because i 'm catholic and i knew it was evil but i thought it was my fault for ten years , " she says . she says she ’ d spoken to her about the sexual harassment she suffered at the hands of a man who was 20 years older than she was . " i had a lot of pain that i wanted to release , " gaga says in a statement , adding that she felt " spoiled " by the fact that she had been assaulted . " i thought i was a survivor . "
