an ancient tomb in northwest spain was destroyed by a picnic table in the city of cristovo de cea , spain , the huffington post reports . the tomb , which is believed to be more than 6,000 years old , was destroyed in a burial chamber , according to a press release . " the site was n't even marked , and the logical thing would have been for them to get in contact with the local council so that we could have taken measures to protect the site , " says a town official . the tomb was found in an area known as celtic settlers , but it 's not clear whether the tomb existed . " this is not representative of spain , where monuments over 100 years old are all preserved by law , " the archaeologist says . " all authorities , national , state and local work effectively preserving our heritage . but sometimes accidents happen . i am sure that such disasters happen in many other countries , but have not been published . " so far , archaeologists have been digging into the tomb for a long time now . " it turns out barcel√≥ is partly right . other countries have destroyed ancient remains , " one archaeologist says .
