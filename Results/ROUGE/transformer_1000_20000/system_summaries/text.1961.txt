the kansas house bill no . 1 passed a bill to legalize discrimination against gay marriage , but it 's not the only one to do so . the bill , which passed the 40-member chamber last night , is expected to pass a measure that would allow same-sex couples to deny entry to same-sex couples on the basis of their religious beliefs , reports the washington post . the bill would allow businesses and government employees to refer to the couple as " public accommodations . " but the bill is n't exactly binding , either . " a strong majority of my members support laws that define traditional marriage , protect religious institutions and protect individuals from being forced to violate their moral values , " says a spokesman for the house of representatives . " however , my members also don ’ t condone discrimination . " the bill was signed by gov . susan wagle , a democrat , and a republican voiced support for the bill . " we ’ re not going to be a gay couple , " he said , per the hill . " it ’ s going to happen . "
