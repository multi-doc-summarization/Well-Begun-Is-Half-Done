a new abortion law that takes effect in the middle of the woman 's last period encourages doctors to get through the trauma of losing a child , the arizona republic reports . according to the new york times , women with fatal fetal defects are expected to die within minutes of their pregnancy . " this law may have intended to do good , but it can really affect non-profit organizations that desperately want to help people but maybe ca n't help the number of people who now come to us , " says a lawyer for the state 's center for reproductive medicine . " we are already stretched very , very thin . i do n't know where this money would come from . " the law , which requires the state to maintain a website list of organizations that provide services to women considering abortion at any stage of pregnancy , is unclear how many of them are because of a fatal problem with the pregnancy . but the state has n't ruled out a ban on abortions after 20 weeks , and a state department spokesperson says there 's no evidence to support the ban . " the decision is a step forward , " he says .
