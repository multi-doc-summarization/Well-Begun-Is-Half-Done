the tennessee division of the university 's freshman commons says it 's renaming the confederacy against vanderbilt university . the university of tennessee 's vanderbilt memorial hall says the name is " a symbol and a reminder of racism , slavery and a very , very bloody civil war . " the building , which has had that name etched into the stone above its entrance since it opened in 1935 , stands in the heart of the confederacy , reports the tennessean . the university will repay the donation in order to remove the confederate chancellor from a residence hall what its leader called the move . " it 's a symbol that is , for many people , deeply offensive and painful , " zeppos says in a statement . " and to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that i just do n't think is acceptable . " the nashville attorney who represented the daughters of the vanderbilt memorial says the $ 1.2 million needed for that purpose . " all it was just a simple monument for the boys in tennessee that died ” in the civil war , jones says , adding that the confederacy did n't immediately use the confederacy 's name to possess the confederate name . the tennessee appeals court ruled in 2005 that vanderbilt could remove “ confederate " from the inscription only after it returned the donation at its current value .
