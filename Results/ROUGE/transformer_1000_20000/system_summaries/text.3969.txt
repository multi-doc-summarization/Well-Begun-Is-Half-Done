the huffington post is out with a story headlined " john wilkes booth are absolutely stupid . i think it was one of our greatest presidents . do i think lincoln was wrong is taking away the freedom of the press and the right of habeas corpus ? yeah . " that 's the gist of a new yorker piece headlined " paul : he 's not a fan of secession . " it 's a sentiment echoed by greg sargent at the washington post , who calls hunter a " serial harasser " and " a nutty liberal , " and a " nutty liberal " who " has a zero tolerance policy for anybody who displays discriminatory behavior or belief in discriminating against people based on the color of their skin , their sexual orientation , anything like that , " he writes . " we wo n't tolerate any of that , and i 've seen no evidence of that . are we at a point where nobody can have had a youth or said anything untoward ? " paul krugman applauds the " <unk> " story . " if i thought he was a white supremacist , he would be fired immediately . all i can say is , we have a <unk> policy for <unk> , ' i â€™ d fire him immediately . "
