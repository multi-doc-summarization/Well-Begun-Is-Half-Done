a new study finds that life on earth is forever lost to the mists of time . researchers at heinrich heine university found that the chemical chain of events that led to the discovery of new insights into the daily life of our last universal common ancestor , luca flavins , and luca geochemically , reports the guardian . the study , published in plos one , found that luca 's team examined more than 560 million genomes of modern microbes , including plants and animals , and found that those who lived in a world of oxygen were more likely to pass genes to their progeny . " this makes it hard to tell whether genes shared by separate microbes reflect a shared or whether some bugs were just better at spreading their genetic material far and wide . and that 's why the study 's lead author , william martin , says the findings suggest that the genes of luca methanogens and his team have been working closely to pinpoint the source of luca 's lifestyle . the study also found that <unk> % of the genes they studied were inherited , and the results of the study did n't establish causation , but they suggest that luca methanogens , the lead researcher behind the research , tells discovery news . " it was a very big surprise , " he says , adding that the study does n't necessarily establish causation . ( another fascinating study found that a man 's protein could help solve the mystery . )
