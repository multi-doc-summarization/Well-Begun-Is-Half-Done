the last world cup that didn ’ t feature the united states soccer program was 31 years ago—and it ’ s not really close . the 2-1 loss to the us men 's soccer program , which had not missed a world cup since 1986 , was pronounced dead at the age of 46 , reports the new york times . “ a shocking defeat to trinidad and tobago was the same , ” says the editorial . “ and all bruce arena ’ s team had to do was earn a tie against tiny trinidad . but the mission and the pressure were the same . " the loss is devastating , but compared to the other qualifying regions , the 3.5 world cup spots out of six teams mean that the united men should be a lock to qualify , " writes matt stray in the washington post . " and we certainly don ’ t have and perhaps never will have a player on the level of progress for a sport that ’ s come so far in a country that still hasn ’ t fully embraced it . all of that gone . "
