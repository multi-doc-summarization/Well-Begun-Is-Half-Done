the black death toll in the bubonic plague is growing , and it 's a big step closer to figuring out why . researchers at europe 's university of oslo say that trace back to gerbils from asia , which arrived in europe in 1347 and caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in human history , the bbc reports . " for this , you would need warm summers , with not too much precipitation , " says nils christian stenseth , who says the study is in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . " it means a high gerbil population across huge areas and that is good for the plague , " he says . " and we have looked at the broad spectrum of indices , and there is no relationship between the appearance of plague and the weather . " the plague is n't the only hazard to humans , but the plague itself is n't contagious , the guardian reports . the disease is believed to have originated in europe , and researchers say it 's possible that the plague could have killed more than 50 million people in the us , and the disease could cause more than a million people to die . the plague 's effects are n't yet known , but researchers say the plague may be linked to the disease , which can cause more serious damage to fleas and other lymph nodes . " such a plague can kill a person , but it does n't have to be a disease , " the lead researcher tells the bbc .
