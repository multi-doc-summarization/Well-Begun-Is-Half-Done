a new study finds that women in the us are increasingly older and better educated than they were two decades ago , and that 's up from 28 % to 10 % . the pew research center reports that the percentage of teens who had a mother in that age group had a 13 % share of births . " while most women giving birth are doing it within the context of marriage , the trend crossed major racial and ethnic groups , " says the study 's lead author . " it 's notable that the population of teens is larger than it used to be , so there were more who could have become teen mothers . " the study , published in the journal of american motherhood , looked at data from the national center for health statistics and the us census bureau . the study looked at 41 births in 2008 , compared to 4.2 million in 1990 . the number of women who were born in 2008 had at least some college education improvements , the los angeles times reports . the study found that women who had been asked why they decided to have a child , most of whom had been high school graduates in 2008 . " i think everyone will welcome a decline in births to teens , " a researcher says .
