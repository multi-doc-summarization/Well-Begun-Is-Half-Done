the fbi is investigating whether former trump campaign chairman paul manafort was involved in the election , but sources tell the new york times that it 's not clear whether the new warrant was part of the fbi 's investigation into manafort 's election meddling . sources tell cnn that manafort , who is believed to have been involved in a grand jury investigation , was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence . the sources say the fbi uncovered a search of a storage facility belonging to manafort , and the fbi has yet to determine whether it will be able to obtain a new fisa warrant that extended at the time of the election . the sources told cnn that the fbi had asked manafort to testify before the president 's inauguration , but the fbi did n't say whether he was cooperating with the investigation . sources say mueller 's investigation is still ongoing , and investigators are still looking into whether the fbi knew about the meeting . the sources say <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
