a new study out of indiana suggests that the taste of an alcoholic drink affects the brain 's reward centers , reports the new york times . researchers found that the men 's brains showed a taste of dopamine , a brain chemical associated with pleasure , has long been linked to the effects of consuming alcohol and other drugs . " we believe this is the first experiment in humans to show that [ the taste ] alone , without any intoxicating effect from the alcohol , can elicit this dopamine activity in the brain , " says the study 's lead author . the study , published in neuropsychopharmacology , found that men who had a family history of alcoholism showed an even greater spike in dopamine levels after they tasted the beer , so the dopamine response may be a heritable risk factor for alcoholism . " this paper demonstrates that taste alone on the brain impacts the brain . " the findings suggest that alcohol abuse could be useful , but they suggest that it 's not enough to cause a change in brain quality . ( in other words , it 's also possible that beer makers are tripping over the beer . )
