the endangered species list of the world 's humpback whales has been banned from the international whaling commission , and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration says it 's looking into whether the whales will be able to focus protection on the animals that need it the most , reports the new york times . the proposal , which is spearheaded by the noaa and the noaa , is expected to be listed as threatened , but it 's not clear whether it will be removed from the list . " as we learn more about the species , and realize the populations are largely independent of each other , " says the noaa 's fisheries director . the noaa says the proposal will be " premature , " but the noaa warns that the whales are " a really complicated species to really review for declaring these endangered species . " the noaa fisheries director tells the times that while the whales have rebounded from the endangered list , they have n't been surprised by the proposal . " we 've got a lot of people in the world , " he says . " it 's going to happen . "
