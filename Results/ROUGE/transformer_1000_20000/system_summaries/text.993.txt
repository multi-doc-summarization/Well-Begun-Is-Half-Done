a new bill filed by state reps. jean o'sullivan and christopher pearson would reinstate alcohol use in vermont , the huffington post reports . " we 're certainly not going to ban alcohol , but when you say you 'll let a drug like that 's far safer that 's still banned , it 's completely ironic , " she says . " the object was to basically embarrass leadership to say that we have [ marijuana legalization ] in front of us , and they 're going absolutely nowhere . " a study published in february found that pot had the lowest risk of mortality when compared with nine other commonly used drugs , including alcohol and tobacco . the study found that vermonters spent between $ 20 million and $ 1 million a year on marijuana in 2014 , and the state 's upper chamber was introduced earlier this year in the legislature , which would also legalize marijuana for recreational marijuana use . the report also notes that the legal sale of marijuana is the least dangerous recreational drug on the market , and it could also amount to $ 500 million in penalties for offenders involved in the sale and distribution centers . the bill also includes a laundry list of possible drug deaths in the state , and a rand paul rep calls it a " huge step forward .
