south carolina rep. jeff duncan has signed a letter to obama stating that " ambassador rice has been our representative to the us . we believe her misleading statements over the days and weeks following the attack on our embassy in libya that led to the deaths of ambassador rice and three other americans caused irreparable damage to her credibility both at home and around the world , " nbc news reports . " i do n't like those words . say that she was wrong for doing it , but don â€™ t call her incompetent , " the letter reads . " it certainly caused a big problem with me . " clyburn says he 's frustrated by those criticizing the ambassador , but he does n't think rice should have a problem with it . rice , a phd rhodes scholar , has been outspoken about rice 's handling of the attack , the washington post reports . rice , who was born and raised in the us at the time , says the letter is " lazy , " but " that is something totally different , " he says , adding that the letter was " lazy " and " very competent " to " say i 'm not going to be secretary of state " and that " if i want to do that , i will never do that . "
