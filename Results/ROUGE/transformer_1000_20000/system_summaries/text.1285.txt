a new wave band is heading to new zealand this month for a day on the green with simple minds . " we wanted to be devo again , and so you can ’ t help but sound like anybody else , we were just going to do what we do and try and write good songs with the same kind of attention to lyrical content and song structure as we ’ ve always given all of our work . it was an interesting experiment because we co-operated with other producers which we 've never really done in the past , we did focus groups to see what other people thought , and we got involved in social media and advertising as people do in the modern corporate world , " says bob casale , whose brother died in niger last year . he says he 's " waiting until after thanksgiving to fly to australia and new zealand . are you looking forward to coming over here ? absolutely . i ’ d like to ask you about a couple of things in regards to your latest album , " he says in a statement . " we were writing like bands do today by using programs and we were sharing files and sending them to each other , which is an interesting process with interesting outcomes . "
