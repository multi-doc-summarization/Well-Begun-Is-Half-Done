antonin scalia 's supreme court decision on the affordable care reform ruling is n't going to be a democratic choice , but the justice department is n't happy about it . " the men describe their legal philosophy , and how to make sense of the law and the us constitution . they call their approach " textualism , " reports the new york times , which has a transcript of morgan 's interview with piers morgan . " even in dissent , stirs controversy would not specifically address the health care decision or other recent or current case issues , " he said . " it was the democratic candidate who created the most waves of disagreement . " he added , " i 'm not 'pro ' death penalty , " adding , " if i do n't know what it 's going to happen . " the justice professor , meanwhile , said that the court 's decision to uphold the mandate does n't matter how long the court is handling it . " the interpretation of legal texts is that scalia is not going to alienate the people of the united states , " said scalia , who added that he has n't lost sleep since the 2000 presidential election . " this is not the first time i 've ever seen anything like this , but i think it 's time to do that . "
