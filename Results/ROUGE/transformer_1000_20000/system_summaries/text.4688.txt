israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu says he has " no intention of killing the jews , " but he says he did n't intend to absolve hitler of his responsibility . " the decision to move from a policy of deporting jews to the final solution was made by the nazis and was not dependent on outside influence , " he says , per the new york times . " the nazis saw in the mufti a collaborator , but they did not need him to decide on the systematic destruction of european jewry , which began in june 1941 . " contrary to the impression that was created , i did not mean to claim that in his conversation with hitler in november 1941 the mufti convinced him to adopt it , " the mufti says in a statement . the mufti , haj amin al-husseini , tells the times that it was a palestinian cleric who gave hitler the idea that the nazis had n't intended to absolve genocide of the holocaust . he says that 's not the case , but the israeli historians say it 's a matter of contention , and that it 's not clear when the nazis perpetrated the holocaust . the new statement went on to describe netanyahu 's actions as " unacceptable , " and that he 's " committed to defending the veracity of the comments , " per the washington post . the mufti 's speech says the mosque was " horrified " by netanyahu 's remarks , which he says was " traumatized " by the speech . " i do n't want to exterminate the jews at the time , " netanyahu says . " i think that 's what i do with them . "
