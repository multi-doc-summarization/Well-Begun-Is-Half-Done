stephanie clifford has moved on to distance herself from the lawyer michael avenatti , who is known as stormy daniels . " i am attempting to speak honestly and openly to the american people about my relationship with now president trump , " clifford tells the daily beast . " i recently made an offer to return the $ 130,000 i was previously paid if it was agreed that i could simply tell the truth publicly . mr. trump and mr. cohen did not even bother to respond . i need funds to pay for : attorneys ' fees ; out-of-pocket costs associated with the lawsuit , arbitration , and my right to speak openly ; security expenses ; and damages that may be awarded against me if i speak out and ultimately lose to mr. trump . i am more fortunate than many , many people in this country . and for that i am grateful . but unfortunately , i do not have the vast resources to fight . " avenatti says avenatti has " been a great advocate in many ways . " he says he has no intention of being bullied , but he has n't spoken to her about legal representation , the new york times reports . " my name is stephanie clifford , " avenatti tells breitbart . " he 's tremendously grateful to him for aggressively representing me in my fight to regain my voice . but in other ways michael has not treated me with the respect and an attorney should show to a client .
