portugal and spain 's captain cristiano ronaldo scored a 2-2 with the world cup to date back to the olympics , reports the guardian . " he is relentless in his pursuit of greatness . what he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous , " says former england winger chris waddle , who scored a hat-trick free kick that disappeared into the top corner of the tournament . ronaldo , who played in the world cups , was the only player to score a hat-trick in world cup history , notes the new york times , which rounds up some of the best goals in the game . " i 'm going to get a flight back tomorrow because i wo n't see a better game , " he says , per the guardian . " it 's just a matter of time . " ronaldo , of course , was n't happy about the game , but he did n't say much about it . he says it was the star turn in a match that is sure to be remembered for years to come , but the bbc reports that he was the one who made the decision to make his mark on the break , which he described as a " <unk> , " per the bbc . the guardian notes that the game was " arguably the most significant event in rio history , " though deadspin notes that it was n't the first time the game had been aired .
