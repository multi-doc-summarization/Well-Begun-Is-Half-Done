it 's been a rough year for the first time in the us , and now researchers are trying to figure out why . the lone star tick , a type of tick , spreads this way , with a sugar called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose , and it 's all because of a life-threatening allergy . the new york times reports researchers have found that the culprit behind the parasite , which is used to treat meat and other diseases , is the result of a " life-threatening allergy . " it 's also possible that the parasite is responsible for the allergy , but it 's not yet known whether it 's the case , but the study 's lead author tells the times that there 's no evidence that allergies are associated with the allergy . " this is the first study in the molecular biology journal , " he says . " it â€™ s very exciting to see what happens next . " the researchers say they 've found evidence that the allergy plate in question is a " tipping point " for the hives , but they have n't yet been shown to be allergic to the hives . " it is very exciting , " says the lead researcher , who adds that the tick can cause a person 's allergy to meat and cetuximab . " we are very concerned about the findings . " ( in other new meat news , scientists have found an allergic reaction to sugar . )
