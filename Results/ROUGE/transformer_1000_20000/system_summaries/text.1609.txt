the federal judge who struck down california 's ban on same-sex marriage has ordered the state to recuse himself from the proposition 8 ruling , the los angeles times reports . " if you thought a judge 's sexuality , ethnicity , national origin ( or ) gender would prevent the judge from handling a case , that 's a very slippery slope , " former chief u.s. district judge vaughn walker said in a conference room at the san francisco courthouse where he served for 21 years . " i do n't think it 's relevant , " he said , according to the chronicle . the measure 's sponsors have asked a federal appeals court to overturn the ruling , but it 's not clear whether walker will be able to appeal the ruling . the decision comes after a judge ruled that walker 's ruling was unconstitutional because no one has the right to represent the state 's interests , the ap reports . the ruling is expected to be challenged by the supreme court . the decision is expected in june , but opponents of the ruling argue that the state is not gay , the times notes .
