" during the procedure the doctor found there was no saline solution in the equipment and so asked a healthcare assistant to pass this to him . however , the assistant became confused and instead of providing the doctor with the requested , accidentally handed him an unlabelled bottle containing that they had prepared for cleaning , " the hannah family said in a statement . " the review of mr. hannah â€™ s care at royal highlighted that he did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on delivering and we apologize to his family for this .
