president trump 's revised executive order on travel and immigration is " an unprecedented judicial overreach , " the ap reports . " a reasonable , objective observerâ€¦ would conclude " that his administration would continue to pursue the matter in court , a promise similar to the one he made after the first executive order was restrained . " this new order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion , " trump said at a rally at nashville 's municipal auditorium . " we are going to take our case as far as it needs to go , including all the way up to the supreme court . " he added that the ban was " tailored to the dictates of the 9th circuit 's -- in my opinion . " he said he was " going to fight this terrible rule , " and that " i do n't know what i 'm going to do . " " i 'm not a fan of president trump , " he told the nashville rally , per the hill . " i 've never been blocked to start with . " the order was blocked by a federal judge 's temporary restraining order on march 6 , 2017 , after the president slammed the order against further restrictions . " we thank you for speaking about our courts , and we are all going to keep our citizens safe , believe me . "
