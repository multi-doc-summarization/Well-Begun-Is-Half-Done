scientists have found a correlation between zebras and small hippos in the sunshine state , but they 've found a way to categorize them , reports the los angeles times . " we know that they grow quickly here and we know their behavior in their native range , and there is no reason to suggest that would change here in florida , " says a study co-author . the study , published in the journal of herpetological conservation and biology , found that three of the crocodiles were found to have been genetically identical to the nile crocodile , which can be seen in the wild . " the odds that the few of us who study florida reptiles have found all of the nile out there is probably unlikely , " a researcher says . the team found that the three crocodiles were captured between 2000 and 2014 , and that they were introduced via the same source . the crocodiles , which live in the everglades , are believed to be the first species to survive , but researchers say they have n't been able to pinpoint the source of the attack , which is believed to have killed more than 28 species . the researchers say that while they do n't know how to swim , they do have a lot of time to do so . ( another recent study found that crocodiles may have been responsible for at least 480 attacks . )
