donald trump has announced he will nominate david friedman as us ambassador to israel , reports the ap . " even though the embassy is in tel aviv . like some of his predecessors , trump has vowed to move the american embassy to jerusalem , a politically charged act that would anger palestinians who want east jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory , " friedman said in a statement thursday . he said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from " the us embassy in israel 's eternal capital . " the move would also distance the us from most of the international community , including its closest allies in western europe and the arab world . the president-elect did not wait long on thursday to signal his intention to upend the american approach . " i can guarantee you , just generally , he 's a man who is going to accomplish many things very quickly , " trump adviser kellyanne conway said , adding that the president-elect " has made that promise . " friedman , who has no diplomatic experience , has said that he does n't believe it would be illegal for israel to annex the west bank , which he sees as an " overall peace deal . "
