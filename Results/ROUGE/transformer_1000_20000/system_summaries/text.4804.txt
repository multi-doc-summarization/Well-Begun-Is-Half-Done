the penny might be more trouble than it 's worth . the wall street journal reports that the cost to produce the one-cent coin increased to 1.5 cents during 2016 , and it 's the most abundant coin in the country . the us mint produced more than 8.4 billion pennies for the first time in nine years . that 's because the penny is 1.43 cents to make , while in 2014 its production value was 1.66 cents . and that 's not the case for nickel , which has also gotten more expensive for its use of stainless steel , nickels , and ship building , and steel nickels . that 's a key ingredient in any kind of circuit or wiring , and the rise of electric cars in particular has put stress on the market . " here 's a easy way to cut the budget plus get rid of a coin no one likes or needs . our bases do not use pennies , " says the mint 's director , who warns that it 's " constantly cutting funds to important programs to save money . " the journal 's headline : " the one-cent us coin , mostly made of zinc sold for $ <unk> million . "
