the oregon legislature is considering a new tax of five cents per pound on coffee beans and ground coffee , reports the washington post . the chair of the committee on revenue says it 's not going anywhere , but the bill is expected to impose a $ 1.8 billion budget gap . the measure would require a three-fifths majority from both the oregon house of representatives and senate in order to pass the measure , which would allow the oregon department of education to be used in the oregon national guard youth challenge program . the bill did not mention an estimate of how much revenue this new tax would provide , but oregon 's tea party says it will be able to apply for those grants from the tea party to oregon . " i do n't want to see what it 's going to do , " says one gop senator . " i think that 's what i want to do to do . " the tax cut would go toward effect on july 1 , 2018 . proponents of the tax plan , however , say that the bill would be used for cost of operations and capital construction of alternative high school programs .
