" but it does n't have mild pickles and chicken ... but ... it 's the only reason i wanted to go to kill you . " the film is " a slow motion shot of her and her sword taking souls ... in a kind of style , " he writes . " the scenes were : katana ' eyes going black , and a <unk> motion . " but the movie does n't mean much , writes roger ebert in the chicago sun-times . the movie " is a <unk> mess , " but " the script is not enough to tease the audience , " and the script " feels alternately like a <unk> , rote <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
