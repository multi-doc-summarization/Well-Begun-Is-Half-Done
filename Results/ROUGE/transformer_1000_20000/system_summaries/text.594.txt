russia 's planned war games in the baltic sea have been heating up , and it 's not the only thing that 's going to happen , according to a former russian navy captain . " i can ’ t imagine the russian navy ever holding a large-scale drill even by itself , " he tells the new york times . " and for the chinese navy , this is just a way to get a taste for ‘ global reach , ’ " he says , adding that the us has " no need for a large-scale exercise " in the past , and that it will be " a trojan horse . " that 's because there 's a lot of chatter about what 's going on in the next few weeks , and the times notes that russia has been trying to figure out what to do with the anti-piracy exercise , which would allow the us to do so in the meantime , the us says it 's looking into the possibility that the military will keep a close eye on military equipment in the future . the us is n't exactly sure how much latitude the exercise will be in place , but it 's still expected to be a week or so ahead of schedule .
