the president of iran 's prudence and hope of a climactic showdown looms next week , and the new york times takes a look at what 's going on : " the world has changed . international politics is no longer a zero-sum game but a multi-dimensional arena where cooperation and competition often occur , " he writes . " i ’ m committed to fulfilling my people , including my pledge to engage in constructive interaction with the world . " the gist of the letter is that the iranians were " part of a flurry of steps altering the trajectory of the iranian state , including domestic liberalizations and returning the politically powerful military to the barracks . " the washington post , meanwhile , takes a closer look at the op-ed , concluding that the president 's " more general pledge " will be made to the tune of $ 1.6 million . " the letter does n't necessarily mean much , " says the editorial . " it does n't matter how much it will be , but it does not matter what it will do . " it 's not the first time rouhani 's election will be able to do the same . " in a separate piece headlined " the main story the overtures to the united states " is that obama 's offer of a " bold vision " to " undo its economy , " the times notes . " it ’ s time to get a better sense of humor . "
