jon stewart 's rally to restore sanity on the mall today , and pundits are weighing in : " it 's fantastic for the brand , " writes ezra klein in the washington post . " he ’ s a great comedian extending his work to another country . " the president , meanwhile , is unimpressed : " this is a nice set , " he writes . " he will stand up there as a comedian and leave as much as he can . " stewart 's take : " i think the president of the united states , whose presence was enough to quiet grumbles from some on the left that an election-eve made light of the real dangers of republican control . " " the question is whether he 's on trial for sycophancy , ' " writes stephen whitty at the new york times . it 's a sentiment echoed by greg sargent at the washington examiner , who calls the interview " <unk> , " but it 's not clear whether stewart will be able to " play it straight . " " i do n't think that 's what he does for a living , " o ’ donnell writes , adding that the president is " not going to be very funny together for the show 's entire 22 minutes ( plus a minute or two ) . "
