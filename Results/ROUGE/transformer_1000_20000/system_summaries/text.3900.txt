" knowing that this is a service for cord , hbo will be able to compete with the network , " writes chris <unk> at the verge . " it â€™ s just what you 'd expect ( for now ) once you successfully register , you 'll find that the hbo now app on apple tv is at least partially open to the idea of users living in the same household , but will that be something it somehow tries to enforce .
