" i 've never seen anything like this before , " he says . " it 's just a matter of time . " ballard says he remembers the ship as a " <unk> , " but he says it was n't the first time the uss amsterdam commissioned it . " i think it 's a good thing to do . " the ship 's final resting place in the farallon islands was manned by the philadelphia navy yard , where it was found in a similar engagement at wake island , reports the ap , which notes that the strike began on august 31 , 1943 , when the three carriers came up with the ship .
