ted cruz 's 1987 the princess bride , mandy patinkin , is n't going anywhere anytime soon . the texas senator , who played the master swordsman inigo montoya , has received emails from friends including friends on the internet that show scenes taken from the movie , the new york times reports . " they photoshopped his face right over my face , " patinkin tells the times . " i said , ' how can i stop this ? ' " he adds , per the washington post , which notes that he 's " doing all of billy 's lines " and that he " would like to respectfully ask him , since he quotes all the lines from ‘ the princess ' and certainly all of my character , inigo montoya . he says he was inspired by wallace 's " allo , my name is inigo montoya . " he was a princeton undergraduate , and he was the first person to do that . " he tells the post that the movie is a " very good thing " for cruz , who has a long history of acting at harvard law school . " it ’ s just a matter of time , but i ’ ve never seen anything like that , " he says , adding that he has no regrets about the " <unk> " movie , which he says is " a lot more talented than i 've ever seen . " ( meanwhile , ted cruz is jumping into the fray . )
