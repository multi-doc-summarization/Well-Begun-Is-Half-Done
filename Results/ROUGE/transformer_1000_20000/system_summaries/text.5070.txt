a new study out of the university of north carolina suggests that children who end up with autism are more likely to develop autism . the study looked at 106 children between ages 2 and 3 , and found that those with autism at least 12 months of age had the disorder , the guardian reports . specifically , the researchers found that the brain had been able to predict the diagnosis of autism . " we see an increased rate of growth in the outer surface of the brain , " says lead researcher joseph piven . the study also looked at the brains of toddlers who had been diagnosed with autism in the 1990s . the study found that children in the general population had a 1 % greater risk of autism than those who did n't look like they have autism . the researchers looked at more than 100 children over the course of the study , and the lead researcher says the findings could help explain why the brain 's circadian rhythms can be seen in the future . piven says the study is " very troubling " and " very cautious " about how much the brain is applied to the brain . " it 's not a matter of debate , but it 's very exciting to see if it is safe to say that this is a big step forward , " he says . " it is a very big deal . "
