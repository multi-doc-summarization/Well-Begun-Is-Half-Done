the secret service agent posted a series of tweets tuesday about president trump and hillary clinton on facebook , saying that she would " take a bullet for both sides . " " as a public servant for nearly 23 years , i struggle not to violate the hatch act . so i keep quiet and skirt the median , " she wrote , per the washington post . " to do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position . but this world has changed and i have changed . and i would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what i believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here . hatch act be damned . " the new york times reports that kerry o'grady , a senior agent in the denver field office , said she would n't honor a federal law that prevents agents like her from airing their political beliefs publicly . she said she was n't allowed to defend president trump , but she did n't have any authority to do so . she said that after the examiner 's review , she had no intention of being able to speak to the public about the issue , and that she had n't spoken to the media about it . " i do n't know what it was , but i did n't know how much it was to do , but it was just a matter of time , and it was like , 'ok , you know , i 'm not going to do that , ' " she said . " it 's a mess , it 's not the right thing . "
