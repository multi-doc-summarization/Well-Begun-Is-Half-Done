the white house has presented four possible methods of ditching the national security agency 's phone-surveillance program , the wall street journal reports . phone companies and the justice department have completed the assignment well ahead of the end of march to be presented with these options , phone companies , their data , and allow the nsa to access certain information upon request . " under this plan , phone control companies retain the data , " the office of director of national intelligence says in a statement . the four options include the fbi and the foreign intelligence surveillance court a non-telecommunications and foreign intelligence agency surveillance court this would provide another separation of power , instead of concentrating both the investigators and the data being investigated inside one organization . " any third party maintaining a single , consolidated data-base would be carrying out what is essentially a government function with more expense , more legal ambiguity , and a doubtful impact on public confidence that their privacy is being violated , " says a spokesman . " obama 's own remarks last month lean towards one of the first two options , but it is unclear exactly when a decision will be reached . "
