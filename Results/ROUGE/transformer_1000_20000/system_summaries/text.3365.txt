white house counsel kathryn ruemmler is seen as the likeliest candidates in the wake of the benghazi attack , according to a new report from the white house and the washington post . kathryn ruemmler , a senior white house official at the university of virginia , says she had a problem with the tea party and other conservative groups , but she says she did n't know what its agencies were up to . " it 's a monstrous communications disaster for an administration that appeared not to know , " she says , adding that the irs had given extra scrutiny to the irs , the new york times reports . " it was the catalyst for the attack , " says a spokesman for obama , who says the report was based on interviews with the irs and the irs . " the irs did not have the authority to do this , " he says . " it would be best not to share it with president obama until the independent audit was completed and made public , and that 's not a matter of time . " ruemmler says she has no intention of being forthcoming about the irs investigation , but " i do n't think it was a hoax . "
