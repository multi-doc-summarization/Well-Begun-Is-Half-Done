a florida restaurant is suing houston 's chain of <unk> , and it says it 's " silly " to eat an entire leaf . the houston chronicle reports miamian arturo carvjal , a doctor with a family practice in hollywood , was mystified by the vegetable . " it takes a sophisticated diner to be familiar with the proper method of consuming an artichoke , " he says . " anybody who 's ever eaten an artichoke knows how to eat one . but he was thinking it was like a food he might have eaten in his native cuba where you eat everything on the plate . " according to the suit , carvajal 's claim that he had " never seen nor heard of previously , " and that the restaurant 's vp says the " outside portion of the leaf should not be eaten ; rather , only the inside portion of it was safely digestible . " the server , which owns the chain for comment , says he 's not sure why the restaurant will eat the bones in our menu , but it 's not clear how much it barks , " the suit says , per the suit . arturo 's lawyer , marc r. nonspecified , says his client 's claim to have taught him about the right thing , but he does n't want to see the rest of the story . " i do n't know what it 's going to happen , but i think it 's time to do it , " carvajal says . " i 'm going to have to post warnings on our menu they should n't eat in our barbecue ribs ? "
