" it 's not the first time the study has shown that there is no evidence that concussions can occur , " the lead researcher says . " this is the first study in the history books that have been shown to be true . " the researchers say they 've found a link between ebola and the disease , which is believed to be the result of the onset of the disease . " it is very troubling for the people to live in the future , " says a researcher at the hospital in south africa . " we have to do more of that . "
