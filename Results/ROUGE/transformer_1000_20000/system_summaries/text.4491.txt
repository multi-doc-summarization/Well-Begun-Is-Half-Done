the great bear rainforest is getting a lot of flak for its handling of the oil pipeline in the wake of the devastating earthquake that killed untold number of sea stars . " it 's a magnificent bear , " says a nonprofit conservation group . " the only thing that 's standing between that is really the spirit bear , the species for a region that needs immediate media attention . " the pipeline , which is the brainchild of alberta columbia university , is teaming up to create a snapshot of this area . " we have an underwater photographer . the idea is that there 's no roads here and no landing strips except for the flat stretches of water along the fjords river , " the group says in a statement , per usa today . " we are not going to be able to do anything about the pipeline itself . " but the organization 's president , cristina mittermeier , says the pipeline is a swat team of photographers that are deployed to an area of the green berets . " they want to bring big oil to this coast , " he says . " some of them do large-format . others are extraordinary wildlife shooters . "
