iranian authorities have delayed the trial of two americans accused of hiking in iraq and were not aware they had crossed into iran , the new york times reports . shane bauer and josh fattal , who were arrested in connection with the 1979 islamic revolution , have been arrested with the men but released on $ 500,000 bail in september , the ap reports . the trial is expected to go ahead as washington and other powers are trying to figure out whether the trial will be delayed or not . " it is illogical . if they want to delay the trial , they should announce it in a notification to me or to sarah shourd , but they did n't , " says a judiciary spokesman . " so the trial should be held on saturday then the judge will decide . " shourd was released shortly before president mahmoud ahmadinejad attended the u.n. general assembly in new york . he said letting her leave jail was a humanitarian gesture due to concerns about her health . she said he was not aware the trial had been postponed , but the talks resumed today .
