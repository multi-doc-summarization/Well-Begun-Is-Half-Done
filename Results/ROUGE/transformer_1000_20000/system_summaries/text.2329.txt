the new york times is out with a story headlined " mike huckabee 's radio show , " and it 's a doozy of a story out of the huckabee post . it 's the conclusion of a craigslist ad that has been viewed more than 500,000 times . the ad , titled " a new and exciting online news publication , " features the tagline , " an endorsement from chuck norris . " it 's not the first time huckabee has been talking about it , but he 's not going to be the first one to do so . " the post has more details on how he 's going on , including the fact that huffington post editor maggie haberman is n't happy about it . " i do n't want any misinformation that i 've ever seen , " she writes . " but i 've never seen anything like this before . " but she adds that the ad is " very mindful " and " <unk> , " but that 's not enough , she writes . " i think it 's time to say that it 's going to happen . "
