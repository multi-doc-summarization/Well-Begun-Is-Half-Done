archaeologists in england have uncovered what they say is the first medieval city in the history books of the ancient city of salisbury , the bbc reports . the probable 12th century was found by archaeologists from the university of southampton , where the remnants of a <unk> medieval city were found in a remote part of the city of <unk> , the guardian reports . " the location , design and size of the courtyarded complex strongly suggests that it was a royal one , " says the lead researcher , per the bbc . " it was the first time that the fortress was built in the early 19th century . " the discovery of the x-ray technology , which is believed to have been used in the roman empire region , is " the first step in the archaeology community , " the researchers say in a press release . " we have a very different understanding of what is going on , " geochemist edward impey tells the guardian . " we are going to be a very big step forward . " he adds that the discovery could help explain the discovery , which could lead to a spate of large volcanic eruptions in the region . " it would have been a huge surprise to see if there were more than 100 structures in the area , but it would n't have been much bigger than previously thought . " it 's not clear how many of the 170 structures built on the site , but the bbc notes that it 's still unclear how many pieces of the fortress 's existence will be found . ( archaeologists recently found the remains of an iron hill . )
