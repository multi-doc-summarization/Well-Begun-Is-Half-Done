president trump punched back saturday at canadian and european warnings that his tariff plan is " unacceptable " by threatening to slap a tariff on european cars if they try to take him on . " if the e.u . wants to further increase their massive tariffs and barriers on us companies doing business there , we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the u.s. , " the president tweeted . " that could spell trouble for car manufacturers like volkswagen and bmw , two of the most popular european brands sold in the us . " the latest volley out of mar-a-lago came two days after trump first announced plans to impose a us tariff of 25 % on steel and 10 % on aluminum . that , in turn , was met by a sharp rejection from canadian prime minister justin trudeau who called the tariffs " absolutely unacceptable . " juncker said they would cause serious disruption of their own in the wake of trump 's pronouncement on metal imports , the new york times reports . the move also prompted e.u . trade chiefs to weigh hitting a broad array of us imports with a 25 % tax in 2017 , with the us slapping more than $ 151 billion worth of goods worth more than a year . the move comes as the us automobile manufacturers association warned that the tariffs could be a " big imbalance .
