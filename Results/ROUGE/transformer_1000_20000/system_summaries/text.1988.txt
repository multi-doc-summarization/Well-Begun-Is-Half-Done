a dam collapsed in southeastern laos monday , releasing large amounts of water that swept away houses and made more than 6,600 people homeless , the ap reports . the dam was constructed by a joint venture led by south korean companies , with thai and lao partners . the project was still under construction , but it 's not clear whether it was a " saddle dam , " or whether it would have been used to hold water beyond what is held by the main dam . " we do n't have a problem with it , " says the director of the xepian-xe news agency . " we have no idea what it was going to happen . " but the south korean government says it has n't identified the cause of the dam 's collapse , and it says it will " continue to look at the interplay of climate change , " the bbc reports . it 's unclear how many of laos 's <unk> dams have been hampered by floods from heavy seasonal rains in the 1970s , but the us geological survey says it 's investigating whether laos 's practices were improperly compromised .
