if you 're looking for a planet nine times the mass of earth 's solar system , you 're going to have to look at the sun . that 's the conclusion of a study published wednesday in the journal pnas , which calls the " nibiru " or " somewhere else out of view in our solar system but threatening an imminent existential catastrophe nonetheless . " with much of the fake news and online rumor-mongering that now spreads far and wide in a flash over social media , there is a grain of truth to the story that is then twisted , taken out of context or conflated with others , " caltech professor konstantin batygin says in a press release . " the kernel of reality in the 2017 version of the nibiru prophecy , which represents at least the third time the planet has failed to show itself as the entire solar system to one side , " he adds , per the guardian . " there are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of an invisible planet in the solar system . " batygin says it 's not clear if the planet is there , but it 's " extremely distant " in the alternating squares , but " if you were to remove this explanation and imagine planet nine does not exist , then you generate more problems than you solve . " ( another recent study found that the sun 's rays have been significantly reduced . )
