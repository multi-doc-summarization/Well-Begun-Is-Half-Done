newt gingrich has been trying to get the nomination of the south carolina governor , but he 's got a lot of laughs today , reports politico . " i believe that after the primaries are over it will be obvious the so-called front-runner in fact did n't get there , and from that point we will be in a whole different conversation , " he said , according to politico . " if romney is stopped , i do n't think he 's going anywhere . " he added that he 's " going to have to do something that 's going to happen . " gingrich , meanwhile , is still running for president , notes the new york times , and he has n't had a chance to win the nomination , notes politico . " he believes the long haul is to get enough delegates to stop romney from getting the nomination before the convention , " says a spokesman for the national review , which notes that gingrich has a long shot at the end of last night 's primaries . gingrich has said that he has no intention of dropping out of the race , reports the washington post .
