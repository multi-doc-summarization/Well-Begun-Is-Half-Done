starbucks ceo howard schultz is planning to open more than one new store a day for the next five years in the world 's second largest economy , reports the los angeles times . " i think if you look at the 45 year history of our company ... one of the things that we 've always played the long game , " schultz said in a shanghai interview . " we 've done really well ahead of the growth curve , " he added , adding that he 's " not going to succeed in china , " and that " it 's mostly chinese . " schultz , who has been working on starbucks since 2021 , says it 's " enviable for huge corporations to rethink their relationship with the company . " he says the company will " educate and teach many chinese about what coffee was , " but that does n't mean it 's time for the company to do so . " we just finished a fantastic year in china where the results are as strong as they 've ever been . " he adds , " we did not make money , " adding , " it was never a latte , but it would have been a long road already for the coffee giant in the us , and it would be hard to get it done . "
