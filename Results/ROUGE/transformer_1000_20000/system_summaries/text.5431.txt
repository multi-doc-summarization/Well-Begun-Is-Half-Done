the isis media group operating across social networks has taken a big step toward promoting the islamic state , the new york times reports . according to the independent , the foundation has allocated $ 260 million for the women , but it 's not clear how much the money will be spent . " it 's kind of a guideline on how to be a good supporter of jihad and have the best role in supporting 'your mujahidin ' as a woman , " says a researcher . " i have n't seen anything like this before . there will probably be forums doing similar things online , but this is the first time i 've come across an actual media organisation giving guidance to women on their role , " he adds , noting that the recipe was prefaced with the turkish government , which has been shared more than 2,000 followers since the 9/11 attacks . but the times notes that the group 's twitter feed has grown so far , with the times noting that it 's " preparing for the wives of isis " and that " the most recent post was a recipe shared on the media . " the times reports that isis has claimed responsibility for the recipe , which is in arabic , but the group says it has no plans to go out and support the group .
