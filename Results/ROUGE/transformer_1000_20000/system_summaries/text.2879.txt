the duke of york has become the first member of the royal family to join twitter , reports the bbc , and prince andrew chose @ thedukeofyork as his handle for the royal navy as a helicopter pilot . " yo how 's jeffrey epstein ? " he tweeted , referring to the american billionaire and friend of the duke who was convicted of soliciting a minor . " the duke is a champion of free speech . for him it 's about telling people what he 's doing , " he added , per the bbc . " the logical next step was to tweet individually . " the bbc notes that ay 's account needed " a more personal touch to be effective " ; it 's not clear how many people wanted to post the tweets , which were signed by prince andrew himself , sacha baron cohen 's comedy character , who used a similar sounding catchphrase . epstein , meanwhile , says he 's " welcome to my twitter account , " but he 's not the only one to ask if his account had been hacked by ali g . " i 'm not going to let him go , but i do n't think i 'm going to do that . "
