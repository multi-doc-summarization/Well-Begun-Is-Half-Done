the city of austin , texas , is welcome to stay in the city . the city 's general manager tells the new york times that the city is looking into the ride-sharing service and lyft , which has n't been able to do so . " disappointment does not begin to describe how we feel about shutting down operations in austin , " he says . " no matter what , the outcome will be mixed . " the group says it will have to scramble to find other work checks for ride-sharing companies and lyft . the move is part of a " stand for a long-term path forward " that would allow drivers to opt out of their main bargaining chip if they do n't follow through on that threat . the times notes that uber has offered to keep negotiating with the city over the past few years , and it 's not clear how many drivers will be able to check their background checks . the times reports that the withdrawal is expected to be finalized in december , but it 's expected to take weeks to finalize a new ordinance that would require drivers to check on background checks .
