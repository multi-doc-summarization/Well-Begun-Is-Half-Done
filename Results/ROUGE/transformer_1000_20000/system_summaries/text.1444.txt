the las vegas-based inventor who turns 76 in march filed a lawsuit against the las vegas vegas-based inventor , who says he 's been waiting that long for a us ruling on whether his electronic signal to control machinery should be granted a patent in 1990 . the suit , filed in january demanding action on what may be the oldest us patent applications in the us patent and trademark office for 35 years , filed a complaint in january claiming the patent applications were " totally unconscionable , " reports the new york times . " the patent office doesn ’ t want to be embarrassed that they might issue a broad patent that would have a sweeping impact on the technology . rather than be embarrassed , they ’ re just bottling it , " says a lawyer for banner & witcoff . the suit also claims that the digital backbone of every personal computer in the world , which specializes in computer-related applications and isn ’ t involved in hyatt ’ s case . hyatt argues that the patent was not sure whether he would replicate the integrated circuit computer architecture , but that it was " not the only one to put a price tag on what licensing those two patents would cost technology , " the suit says . but it 's also possible that the inventors behind the delay have been recruited to make the patent look bad during years of disputes .
