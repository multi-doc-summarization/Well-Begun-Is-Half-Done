anthony weiner 's twitter account is getting a lot more attention than the opie and anthony show . in a tweet monday , conservative activist andrew breitbart wrote that he has an x-rated picture of a man 's crotch , reports nbc news . " i do n't like to think of it that way , " he wrote . " there are a lot of women . who could come forward . asked directly if he considered the unpublicized picture an insurance policy , breitbart replied that if weiner wants to open himself to further investigation , it will be interesting to see how much this picture affects the story . after all , everyone 's basically already seen weiner 's penis covered by underwear . and the photo doesn ’ t look like you ’ ve already voted . sorry , you can react up to three times . share this & help it go viral , making them more actively involved in the story . " the new york daily news reports that weiner , who has been on the run for three years through social media sites like twitter and facebook , is n't buying it .
