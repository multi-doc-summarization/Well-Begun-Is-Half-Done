the usda 's food safety and inspection service is taking a look at what 's going on : sell by , " best if used by the calendar shown , " the usda says in a press release . the fsis says it 's " hoping to reduce food waste , the truth is on the label , but stores and consumers throw away an inordinate amount of food every year simply because that date has passed . " it 's not clear whether the food producers are perfectly safe to eat , a 2014 study out of harvard found that 90 % of americans had thrown out food at some point based solely on the date stamped on the packaging . the fsis notes that the fsis 's guidance is voluntary and determined by the usda that it does n't appear to be responsible for the fact that it 's the last date on which a product will be at its peak freshness . " foods not signs of spoilage should be reserved for infant formula , " says the fsis . " research shows that this phrase conveys to consumers that the product will <unk> of best quality if used . "
