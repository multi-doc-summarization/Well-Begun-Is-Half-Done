peter madsen , the danish inventor charged with murdering swedish journalist kim wall in his computer submarine last month , was found dead in her ribcage and genitals , the guardian reports . madsen 's boyfriend , jakob buch-jepsen , says the computer searched by police was not his . " they are the space laboratory ’ s tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory , " he says . " our suspicion hasn ’ t changed , it has been strengthened since ( the last hearing on ) september 5 . " the court heard he had been working on building a space rocket in the lab . he remained calm during the pre-trial session , sitting with his hands folded most of the time . madsen says she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on his uc3 submarine . he says the court ordered him detained for four weeks as investigations continued . he says madsen was hit with the death of the journalist , who was researching a story on madsen , went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre ( 56-foot ) , and then killed her . the bbc reports that madsen has told the court in past hearings that he tried to bury her whole body at sea , and that he did n't believe it was a hoax . the guardian notes that madsen 's lawyer says the cause of death remained unknown , but that it 's unclear why wall was injured .
