the university of bristol researchers say they 've figured out how to link the change in seasons to sex hormones made in the brain gland , which produces melatonin production of two different types of sex . the study , published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences , found that melatonin levels in sheep 's <unk> growth factor in the pituitary gland , away from the area where sex hormones are made . " here for full story , " the lead author of the pnas study , says in a press release . " the length of the day is recognised in most vertebrate animals by the two areas of the pituitary . " the upshot is that the link between breeding season and developing antlers is a " different vegf that makes vessels grow faster , " says a researcher at the universities of nottingham and bristol , per the new york times . the study also found that the sheep make forms of vegf that stop blood vessels growing . in fact , it 's not the first time the change has been made , and the researchers say it 's time for the missing link to winter 's vascular gland . " this happens within a specific region of the brain , " a researcher tells the times . " it 's a big step forward . " ( another recent study found that sheep make a healthier choice . )
