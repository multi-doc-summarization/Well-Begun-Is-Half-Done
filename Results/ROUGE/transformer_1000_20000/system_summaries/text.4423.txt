scientists have discovered a bear bone found within the chamber of 47,600 years ago , and it turns out that neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for . the new york times reports that the rings were older than any known cave painting , which was used in the oval office in 1990 , when researchers found the remains of the rings and mounds of dirt . " i ’ m not very big , and i had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through , " lead researcher francois rouzaud tells the times . " it ’ s kind of magical , even without the structures. . " the study , published wednesday in plos one , found that the cave 's remnants had been broken off by the cave , which is believed to have been the only early humans in the south of france at the time . researchers say they 've found evidence that the bear had been laid down in the cave using the rings , but they have n't been able to figure out how to use the rings . " we 've never seen anything like this before , but it was so exciting to see what was going on , " rouzaud says . " it was just a matter of time . " the guardian reports the discovery could have been a long way for the cave dwellers to be seen , but researchers say it could be impossible to find evidence of the existence of homo sapiens . the times notes that the discovery is a " huge step forward , " with the times noting that it 's a " significant step forward .
