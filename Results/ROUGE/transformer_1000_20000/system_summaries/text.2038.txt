the 13th , or even more impressive : the 13th floor of london 's m25 institute of sciences is set to open tomorrow , reports the ap . the number of injuries from car accidents is expected to rise as much as 52 % on the 13th . " the risk of a transport accident may be increased by much as as a result of superstitious people choosing not to drive that day , " says the head of the university of atlanta . " this is not the first time we 've seen such a thing happen again . " the study , published in the british medical journal , also found that the 13th gate was the smallest in the world , but it 's not clear how many people were married or buying a house on a day marked by the end of the year . " i think the southeast is very superstitious . it 's a lot more complicated than it is . it 's unlucky to see a lot of scientific research that have given people a little more cause for concern , even if the scientists who performed the work are n't alarmed by their findings , " the lead researcher says in a statement , per the guardian . " there is no reason to believe that any number would be lucky or unlucky . "
