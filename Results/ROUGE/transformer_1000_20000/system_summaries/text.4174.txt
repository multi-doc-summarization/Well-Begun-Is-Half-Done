the british royal air force is sending a message to isis : " it utterly disrespects the people of my wonderful city by slapping our name on a missile , an instrument for causing death and destruction , " the guardian reports . " the words written on the bomb are an unpleasant example of everything that ’ s wrong with our current approach to foreign policy and our penchant for chaotic funding conflicts that further destabilise countries and create the conditions ideal for extremism to flourish . it ’ s the very embodiment of an eye for an eye . " the photo , posted on social media , was taken down by an raf spokesperson for the un security council , the bbc reports . " we want healing , not more violence and horror . " but the guardian notes that it 's not clear when the image was created or if the bomb was ever dropped , and the guardian says it was n't the first time the manchester arena executed in the country . " i think there 's a lot of people who have pulled together in a time of crisis , showing incredible strength in supporting one another , regardless of religion , ethnicity , religion , or background , " says the head of manchester ❤ , who says he 's " outraged " about the attack . " i do n't think it was a terrorist attack , " he says . " it was just a matter of time . "
