hillary clinton 's book the choice " takes a village and other lessons children teach us , " writes bob woodward in the new york sun-times . the book , which is still to be published , takes a behind-the-scenes look at the clintons , as well as bob and elizabeth dole . the clintons have " moved into the white house " for days at a time to help with revisions , the sun-times reports . the book portrays houston as an influential adviser who urged clinton to write her book , " i do n't know how much it would be , " says woodward , who says she is " too personal . " " i 've never seen anything like this before , " she says . " i have no idea how many people are going to do that . " woodward , a longtime anthropologist of the foundation for mind research , says she has no regrets about her imaginary conversations with clinton , but she says she does n't have any regrets about what she 's doing . she says that when she first spoke to her , she was told she had n't been invited to speak to her husband , and she was n't allowed to speak at all . " i was a little surprised when i was in the room , and i was so happy that i had a good time , but i was like , 'oh my god , ' " she recalls . " i had no idea what i was talking about . i was just trying to talk about it . "
