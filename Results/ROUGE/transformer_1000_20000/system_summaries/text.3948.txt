the us military says it 's " a bridge to nowhere , " but a new report from the us embassy in kandahar province finds that the city 's power supply will be " an important part of the overall american military effort , " reports the los angeles times . the report , published in the new york times , accuses the taliban of using " kandahar bridging solution " to operate lights , television sets and fans would please " lead many of them to throw their support behind the afghan government . " we can not just throw money at a country like this and expect it to have a good incentive , " says the head of the inspector general 's office of strategic affairs . the report also accuses the us of trying to beat back the taliban in 2011 , and it 's not clear whether the city will be able to buy diesel for the generators , reports the wall street journal . the counterinsurgency is n't so sure , however , because the afghan forces do n't have the firepower compensated , and that 's not the case . " the counterinsurgency does n't think the additional electricity was greater than the city receives from the generators . " the report does n't support the assertion , but it does n't bode well for the us , notes the washington post , which notes that the report is based on a number of factors that have been deemed to be unreliable .
