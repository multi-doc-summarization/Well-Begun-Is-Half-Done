elvis juice may not be the only thing to do with sustainability , but if you 're going to get rid of it , you 're not alone . the scottish brewers have been trying to figure out what 's going on , and the guardian reports that it 's not clear how the beer got its name , but it 's still a matter of contention . " we would like to recommend that presley 's estate diverts its attention to another potential source of quick remuneration , " says the founder of daft punk . " but it was n't a great idea . " brewdog says it was " <unk> , " but the company says it did n't have to do so , and that it was only " <unk> " and " <unk> , " and therefore " notwithstanding , " it was a mistake to do that , " he says , per the guardian . " i was trying to do something about it , and i did n't want it to happen . i was so scared of it . i was just so scared . i was n't going to die . i was like , 'oh my gosh , i 'm sorry , ' " says brewdog 's ceo , who says he 's not trying to sell it to the museum , which is now petitioning to open a pub devoted to its patrons . the company 's ceo says the company has " a whole lot of assumptions " about its use of the product , but that does n't mean it wo n't sell it . " i do n't think it 's a good idea , " brewdog 's attorney says in a statement .
