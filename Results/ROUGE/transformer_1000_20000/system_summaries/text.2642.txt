a florida teacher has been charged with battery of a urinal with his bare hands . jennifer forshey , 58 , says she forced a 10-year-old to use his hands and a paper towel to remove all the paper from the drain , the broward county register reports . " i did not do anything illegal , " she says . " the only reason we are bringing this story to the public is to find out why a teacher would allow this to happen . she also asks for her and her son 's privacy to be respected and wants her son to retain a normal life back at the school . that 's not cool , " forshey says . " i hope it does n't reflect on the school , " but it 's a really good school . " police say the boy 's hands were saturated in " what smelled like urine " from the urinal , which was released on $ 1,000 bond . she says the boy " used really bad judgement " and that he did n't know who had clogged with paper towels , but she says she got in trouble with the urinal because she had no soap in it . she says it was n't his fault , and she was told by police she had clogged the urinal . " that teacher should go back to jail , " says a teacher at broward community charter school .
