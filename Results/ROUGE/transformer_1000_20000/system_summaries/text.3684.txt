the top house and senate democrats said wednesday they had reached agreement with president trump to protect thousands of younger immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from former president barack obama 's deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , reports the ap . the deal announced by senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi following a white house dinner would enshrine protections for the nearly 800,000 immigrants . " we agreed to enshrine the protections of daca into law quickly , and to work out a package of border security , excluding the wall , that 's acceptable to both sides , " pelosi said in a joint statement . it was the second time in two weeks that trump cut out republicans to reach a deal with pelosi and schumer . a person briefed on the meeting , who demanded anonymity to discuss it , called the dream act that provides citizenship for the young immigrants . the program provided temporary work permits and protection from deportation . trump ended the program earlier this month and had given congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the statuses of the so-called " dreamers " begin to expire . the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but said in its own statement that the president had " a constructive working dinner " with schumer , pelosi and administration officials " to discuss policy and legislative priorities , " including daca . " we want to see if we can do something in a bipartisan fashion so that we can solve the daca problem and other immigration problems . "
