a new survey by the federal reserve finds that the number of people who are near retirement age have zero money saved , the new york times reports . the survey found that 41 % of respondents said they 'd plan to retire at the same age as they had prior to 2008 . that 's down from 53 % to 29 % , and that 's up from 55 % to 64 % , the times notes . that 's a huge increase in the financial crisis , with the times noting that the percentage of people with incomes under $ 25,000 reported having no retirement savings or pension . " the sobering statistic was one of many released by [ the fed ] on thursday as part of its report on the economic well-being of us households , " says one pollster . " it can affect the future of many things in america . " in fact , it 's not the first time that the fed will retire at a later age than before they had before 2008 , and it 's still not clear how many americans will be able to move forward , the los angeles times reports . " we ’ ve got a lot of people said they rarely thought about retirement now , " one expert says . " it ’ s time to say that ’ s a problem . "
