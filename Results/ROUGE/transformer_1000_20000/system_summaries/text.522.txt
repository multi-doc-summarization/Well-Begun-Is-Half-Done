the kalamazoo box was a card that read " do not open until your 1st <unk> . " that 's what the denver post calls a " worse one . " it 's the culmination of a year of wrangling over the plain white box . " that was the brainchild of brandon gunn , who tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me . " so , i thought back to our wedding day ( nearly 9 years later , there were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up… but we never opened the box . i honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box , because it would have symbolized our failure , " he writes . " it was by far the greatest wedding gift of all . for 9 years ( and three moves ) , my great aunt and uncle had been married for nearly half a century . so , we thought the box would save “ us , ” he writes . but gunn had n't forgotten about the box . " i realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong , healthy marriage were never within that box they were within , " writes marcotte . " the funny thing that meant the very most was still sitting in a shelf in various dust , yet it somehow taught us about tolerance , understanding , compromise and . our marriage strengthened as we became best friends , partners , and teammates .
