india 's top court has ruled that adultery is unconstitutional and discriminatory against women , reports the guardian . the court ruled that the law , which carried a prison sentence of up to five years , slaps a woman without her husband 's consent . " it is time to say husband is not the master , " says the head of india 's national commission for women . " this is a law from british era . although the british had done away with it long since gone , we were still stuck with it. ” the ruling comes after a 41-year-old woman accused of sexual assault and adultery in a lawsuit filed by the indian penal code . “ the time when wives were invisible to the law ... and lived in the shadows of their husbands , ” says the chief justice . “ it was an outdated law . which should have been removed long back . " the court found that the court did not allow the law to proceed , but it was often raised in divorce proceedings , and the court said it would not allow women to stand while the national anthem is played .
