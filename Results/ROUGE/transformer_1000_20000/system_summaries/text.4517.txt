the bombay high court in india is closing in on one of its most high-profile victims in the country . the sisters , who were set to become the first women to be hanged in 1996 , were sentenced to death in connection with the deaths of 10 of them between june 1990 and 1996 , reports the guardian . the rejection came after the sisters ' mother , anjana shinde , died in jail , and the mother of one of the victims says they were " traumatized " by the rejection . " it was just a matter of time , " she says , per the guardian . " there was a delay of over two years . " but the guardian reports that the rejection of the rejection was not meant to be made public . " we are following all legal procedures and the recent supreme court guidelines , " says the report . " the minimum period of 14 days is given between the receipt of communication of mercy petition and execution , so that the execution will be stayed . " the court has ruled that the women , who are lodged in solitary confinement , have not been executed . " it 's not the first time the execution has been made , " a lawyer for the group says . " this is a very tragic outcome . "
