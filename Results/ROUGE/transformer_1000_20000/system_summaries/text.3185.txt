if you 're looking for fruit flies , you 're not going to be able to get a lot of light bulbs . a new study by the university of seattle suggests that fruit flies alter course in less than one centimeter , the los angeles times reports . " we discovered that these flies are fast and accurate in their response , " says michael dickinson , a researcher at the paper . " what we have found is that these fruit flies are alter their wings , which is faster than we blink our eyes . " the study , published in science , calls the study " a step forward , " and notes that it 's both the speed and accuracy of the flies that flap their wings . the study 's lead author , florian muijres , says the team is working to figure out how to make a computerized model of fruit flies . " they do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement , " he says . the team also found that the flies have been able to fly from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate , but they have n't yet figured out what to do in the future . the researchers say they 've found a correlation between light and volcanic activity , and they hope to create a clearer understanding of what 's going on . the team hopes to discover the interplay between the two groups and the likelihood of a second , 50 times faster than the typical centimeter , and the smaller ones are more likely to survive . ( another recent study found that a man 's brain may have saved his life . )
