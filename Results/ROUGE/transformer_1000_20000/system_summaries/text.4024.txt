saturday night live does n't often do that well with sports heroes in the wake of the north korean dictator 's death , but it 's dennis rodman . " she goes all out to get laughs , not worrying about political correctness , " he writes in the new york times . " she stoops to conquer , if that 's what it takes , and viewers appreciate the no-holds-barred approach . she had a string of funny things that i wanted to do . see below . i 'm not really sure what the point of rodman 's appearance is . is he satirizing his recent standing as a buddy of north korea 's supreme leader ? what 's the joke here ? i wonder if he 's in on the joke or not , to be honest . anyway , he gets a reaction from the crowd and gets to the point that he 's paid to hang out with a dictator . " the sketch is " a natural for snl , " writes chris cillizza in the los angeles times , and it 's a " baffling appearance , " but " it 's not a cameo from the show . "
