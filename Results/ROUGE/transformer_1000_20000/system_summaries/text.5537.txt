portland , ore. , is n't the only place to film the saga of black lives matter , but it 's not the first time a show has been made public . the show , which has had a net effect on our neighborhood and the city of portland , played by carrie brownstein and fred armisen , has been debating issues such as bullying and white supremacist groups , the new york times reports . " the additional exposure we have received from our time on portlandia does not provide financial or political support of any kind : tourists and fans of the show come to our door to stand outside , take selfies , and then leave . " it 's a direct response to a particular show in our space which saw our store left a mess , our neighbors forced to close and lose business for a day without warning , and our repeated attempts to obtain accountability or resolution dismissed . " the show is " bad the women and women first from ifc 's portlandia , " per the times , which notes that it 's " not that black people are black or hispanic , " but it does n't cover the additional business lost by our neighbors who at times also have to remain closed for filming . " i 'm not going to be here anymore , " one woman says . " i do n't think that bothers me . "
