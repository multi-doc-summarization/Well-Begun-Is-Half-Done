a species of snake that had been " lost " for almost 80 years has been found on a remote mexican island , the ap reports . according to a study published in plos one , the clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the revillagigedo islands , more than 400 miles off mexico 's pacific coast . the original , and until recently the only spotting of the species was made by american naturalist william beebe , a researcher for the national museum of natural history says the snake 's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree and washed out to sea . " it ’ s very interesting and significant because of the controversy surrounding the snake ’ s crust , " martinez says . " it is the first time the snake has ever seen . " the snake , which is believed to be the only species to be discarded in a glass jar , is only a small fraction of its size , and it 's not clear how many snakes from mexico 's sonora-sinaloa coast are located , but it 's unclear why the island 's natural history will be due to a lack of oxygen deprivation . " it 's a matter of time , " gomez says , adding that the island is " very interesting . " but the snake is n't so sure . " i do n't know what it was , " he says . " i think it would n't happen to anyone . "
