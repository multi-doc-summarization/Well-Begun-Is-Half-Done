google has moved to highlight the issue of government censorship and demands for information about web users , reports the wall street journal . the number of requests that we received between july 1 , 2009 and december 31 were received from government agencies for data about the way it handles user data . the company says it is reviewing its requests to remove content from its search engine , but it 's not clear whether the requests will be made public , notes the new york times . " we know these numbers are imperfect and may not provide a complete picture of these government requests , " says the company 's chief legal officer . " we â€™ ll continue to improve this tool and fine-tune the types of data we display . " the move comes after a group of privacy commissioners issued a letter to google asking for the removal of more than one url or for the disclosure of information for multiple users . google says it 's investigating the requests , but the journal notes that it 's unclear how many government agencies will be able to pore over the data .
