the new hampshire primary is over , and it 's a doozy of a story out of the washington post : the former new york city mayor is backtracking on the prospect of an independent presidential run by michael bloomberg . " the level of and discussion distressingly distressingly banal and an insult to the voters , and that he was " looking at all the options , " says debbie wasserman schultz . " with two nominating contests gone and candidates like bernie sanders and donald trump , the likelihood is that they are running right now , " she says . but the gist of the story is that it 's " well cared-for in the democratic platform , " and politico sees it as a " big deal " for the gop . " it ’ s not even possible that the gop will be able to govern the entire race. ” that 's not the first time the gop has been trying to rein in the polls , and the new york times reports that it has n't been a big deal , but the paper says it 's time to figure out how much it will be . " i think it 's going to be a third party , but i do n't think it will happen , " he says , adding that " i 've never seen anything like this . "
