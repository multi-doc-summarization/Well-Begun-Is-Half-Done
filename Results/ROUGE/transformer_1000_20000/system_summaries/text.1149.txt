a new study out of uc berkeley finds that a blurry , dream-like interpretation of brain activity can be seen as a surrealist painting . researchers from uc berkeley say they 've found that the mri machine used to create a " movie reconstruction algorithm , " which matched the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex , reports the los angeles times . " in order for this technology to have wide applicability , we must understand how the brain processes these dynamic experiences , " says the lead author of a study in current biology . " it 's only a small step towards mind reading , but the scientists are not sure what it is . " the researchers say the team was able to reconstruct the videos , but they were able to determine whether the videos were genuine , reports nature . the researchers , who describe the study as " a major leap toward internal imagery , " say they have no idea what to do . the team says the findings are " continuous , " but they warn that " neural activity " could be used to predict what was taking place in the mind . the study , which looked at data gathered by the mri , says it 's not clear whether the findings will be applied to humans , but it does n't look into the videos .
