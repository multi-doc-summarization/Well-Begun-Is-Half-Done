john mccain says he was born on a us military base in panama , mich. , when he ran in 1964 . " i don â€™ t know the answer to that , " he told chris wallace , per the hill . " i know it came up in my race because i was born in the canal , which is a territory . it 's no secret that that is hated by mccain and lots of the washington establishment . " he added that he 's " unsure about cruz 's status , " and that " it 's worth looking into " whether texas senator mccain is eligible to serve as president , reports the washington post . mccain , who is born in canada to an american mother , says he is n't the only one to have a son , but that does n't mean he does n't want to be president . " if you do n't know what to do , you know , " mccain says . " you have a lot of people , and you know how to do that . " mccain , meanwhile , is n't buying any of his own accord , reports politico , which notes that it 's not clear if he 's born in panama . mccain 's father , nate weissman , says his son is a " very good man " who 's been " very successful " and " very proud " of him , though he does have a hard time to get out of the job . " we 've never seen a penny of it , but i 've never had a problem with it , " cruz says .
