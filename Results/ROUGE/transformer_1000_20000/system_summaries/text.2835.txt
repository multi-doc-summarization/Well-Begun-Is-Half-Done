the monroe county heritage museum attorney matt goforth is suing the author of a lawsuit filed last week alleging that the museum is a " substantial business " in the town of maycomb , the guardian reports . " it 's kind of sad . i don ’ t think this is what harper lee wants , " he says . " the museum doesn ’ t like to be in this spot . we didn ’ t start it. ” the lawsuit claims lee suffered a stroke and is in ill health . the suit claims the museum has attempted to take advantage of lee 's name or characters , but it 's not clear whether the lawsuit will be filed against lee . " it ’ s not a single incident in which goforth committed suicide , " an attorney for the museum tells the new york times . " he ’ s going to have to pay for it , " says the museum 's lawyer , rankin , who represents the author , per the guardian . lee , who is suing lee for failing to use the book to kill a mockingbird , says he has no plans to appeal the lawsuit , which is the culmination of a 50-year career in the 1930s and has been translated into more than $ 500,000 in revenue in 2011 , reports the guardian .
