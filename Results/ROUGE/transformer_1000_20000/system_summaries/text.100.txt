the nba finals got its hands on a run of being eliminated in the nba last night , and it was n't the only one to do that . the team 's first sports team in the eastern conference was the first to make the decision , reports the los angeles times , which notes that malone won honors by the team . the team , which took over as head coach before the 1977-78 season began , had a 65-17 record for the first time in four years . " i was just with him and darryl at the ceremony at the wells fargo center when the name of malone comes up , " says billy cunningham , who led the team . " we needed exactly what we needed was that physical presence , " cunningham says . " it was a very difficult decision . " malone , who was in las vegas for two years , was inducted into his sleep in norfolk , va. , in his first season with the sixers , and he died in the past year . he had been working on the nba for more than a quarter of the time , but he had lunch with moses and bobby jones a couple years later . the team did n't have any takers , but they did n't know what to do , and they did find a way to get it done . " it â€™ s a very sad day for darryl and lloyd , " dawkins says .
