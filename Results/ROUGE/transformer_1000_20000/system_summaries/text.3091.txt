a trove of 195 million-year-old remains found in the royal basilica of st. denis , france , were found to have belonged to king henry . the new york times reports researchers found the remains of the three descendants of the house of bourbon , which the bbc describes as " an embalmed head with several vertebrae still attached . " it 's not clear how the dna was used , but researchers say it was off with dna samples given by three male descendants . " this is the first time we did this , " says one of the researchers , who led the study . the remains were found in 1919 in the 1930s , but none of those matched the dna of the bourbon king henry . researchers found that henry 's remains got the same treatment that befell his grandfather , louis gallant , on the throne , reports the ap . the researchers say they 've found evidence of a pierced ear seemed to support the theory , which is why the head of the french medical journal and the washington post say it 's " impossible " to find a link to the mummified remains . " we have a lot of evidence , " the study 's lead author says . " we are precluded from giving any information . " ( another fascinating archaeological find : a man who lived in a church in 1610 . )
