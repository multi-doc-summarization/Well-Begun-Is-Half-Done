a new study suggests that vertebrates have lived on land , some 400 million years ago , and now researchers are reporting in the journal nature . in a study published wednesday , researchers say they 've found that the species , known as the " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> genomes , were found to be the result of a " <unk> " or " <unk> , " the guardian reports . in the study , researchers published their findings on the evolutionary theory of how the placenta was found in a cave in south africa , where researchers found the placenta had been drained . the telltale clue is that the genes were lost in the placenta , which is why the placenta is so distinct that it can be applied to humans . the study 's lead author , <unk> <unk> , tells the washington post that the findings are " very exciting . " the findings suggest that the placenta may be a distinct source of the puzzle , but they suggest that it could be a " tipping point " for the scientists to figure out how to shed light on the placenta 's bones . " it 's a very exciting discovery , " he says . " it is very exciting . " the researchers , who describe the study as " the first step in the molecular processes , " say the study is " a very significant step forward . " ( another fascinating find in the modern world . )
