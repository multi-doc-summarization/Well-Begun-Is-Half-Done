when deborah skouson posted a photo of her shirt to facebook last week , she wrote , " we were hoping for 4â€“5 shirts to use as backups so we would n't have to keep washing and mending the same shirt over and over , " per the daily dot . " i accepted their offer with tears streaming down my face , " she wrote . " the kindness being shown my little girl has been so beautiful . " skouson , who was born in germany , had been the fifth grade on august 11 , when her daughter was a little confused to see more than one of her 'pink shirts . " i was very apologetic , and i assured her that her efforts meant so much more to us than the shirt , " skouson wrote in a facebook post . " i explained to her that people gave them to her because they loved her . " skouson says she 's " setting her up for failure , " but she does n't want to wear the shirt to fit cami into adulthood . " it 's not the first time i 've ever seen my daughter 's 'obsession , ' and that i 've never seen it in my life , " her mother says in a statement . " it is not a matter of time , but it 's a good thing . it 's just about time . it 's time to tell me what 's best for her . if the shirt makes her happy , i 'm going to do everything in my power to find it for her . " skouson 's mom , cami , says the shirts have been shared more than 2,000 times
