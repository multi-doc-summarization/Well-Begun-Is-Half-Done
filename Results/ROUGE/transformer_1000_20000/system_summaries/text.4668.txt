scientists have discovered that the earliest known ancestor of humans is a microscopic , bag-like sea creature that lived about 540 million years ago , the bbc reports . according to a press release , the microscopic sea animal is the earliest step on the evolutionary path . " we think that as an early deuterostome this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species , including ourselves . all deuterostomes had a common ancestor , " researcher simon conway says . " to the naked eye , the fossils we studied look like tiny black grains , but under the microscope the level of detail was jaw-dropping . " the study was published in nature , nature reports , and it 's not clear how much the creature 's mouth was , but researchers say they 've found evidence that the animal had an anus , relatively flexible skin and muscles . it 's also possible that the sand was consumed by the same orifice . the researchers say that while the creature was n't capable of producing sand on the sea floor , it was n't the first time humans had been able to find any trace of the sac , which was found in the mouth of a wooden box . but the findings suggest that the creature is the most likely source of the puzzle , the guardian reports . according to phys.org , saccorhytus is the smallest known ancestor ever seen in the world . ( another recent study found that humans may have lived more than a century . )
