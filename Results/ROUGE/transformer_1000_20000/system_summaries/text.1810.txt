a new study out of italy finds that exposure to bright lights can lead to greater reported levels of sexual satisfaction in men who have been given the active light box , reports the guardian . the researchers looked at 38 men who had been diagnosed with an adapted light box which gave out significantly less light . they found that the group had tripled testosterone levels in the morning for two weeks , while the other half was treated with a light box . " in the northern hemisphere , the body 's production naturally declines from november and april , " the lead researcher tells the bbc . " you see the effect of this in reproductive rates , with the month of june showing the highest rate of testosterone levels . " the study , published in the journal plos one , found that testosterone levels were associated with disorders including alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , and other cancers . the findings suggest that the light box really mimics what nature does , the bbc reports . the researchers say that while the light hits the back of the eye , it does n't appear to be linked to the bright lights , which are used to treat plaque growth . ( another recent study found that a new gene could be used as a weapon . )
