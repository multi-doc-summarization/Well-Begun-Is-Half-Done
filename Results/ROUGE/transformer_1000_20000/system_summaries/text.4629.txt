the uk 's medical director says he 's " disappointed " may not be informing women that their families are stillborn , the guardian reports . " that is why i have asked sir bruce keogh to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue , " he tells the guardian . " i share the view that incineration of fetal remains is inappropriate practice and that other methods offer more dignity in these sensitive situations . " he says the practice is " totally unacceptable " and that it 's not illegal across the uk , existing professional guidance makes clear that the practice does n't apply to women who have had an abortion or miscarriage . " the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way , " the head of the care quality commission tells the telegraph , which notes that the move comes after hospitals have been forced to cremate or bury their bodies . " i am disappointed trusts may not [ be informing or women and their families . this breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use services and i 'm keen for it , " says keogh , who says she 's looking forward to the idea that it would be better not to use incineration at all . " while it is acknowledged that incineration is a stillborn patient , it 's unclear if the fetus will be incinerated as waste .
