a new study out of the university of hawaii suggests that parkinson 's may be linked to signs of parkinson 's disease . researchers found that men who drank more than two cups of milk daily at the start of the study had 40 % fewer brain cells , reports nbc news . the study , published in neurology , looked at 8,000 japanese-american men in hawaii who were taking part in the study . " for people living with parkinson 's , understanding the impact of environmental factors is crucial , " says lead researcher robert abbott . " it 's known the milk in hawaii was contaminated , probably from the feed given to the cattle . " the study found that those who drank the most milk day had the fewest brain cells in the early 1980s , reports the los angeles times , which notes that the study did n't establish causation , but the researchers caution that the findings could be replicated in humans . the researchers say that while the men drank less than 16 ounces of milk per day , they did n't know how much milk they drank as part of the brain , and that they were able to donate their brains for study after they died , the guardian reports . the researchers also found that the pineapple had been banned in the us in 1988 , compared to 63.4 % for those who had consumed no milk . the study also found men whose average age was 54 had parkinson 's syndrome , which was taken off the market for most of the time . ( another study finds that gamblers may be able to eat more carbs . )
