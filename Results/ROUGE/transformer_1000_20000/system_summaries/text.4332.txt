president trump met with historically black universities at the oval office last night , and it did n't go smoothly . " now that we 've gotten that off our chest , we think it 's fair to highlight some of the jokes and memes that made light of the truly ridiculous moment since the existing administration needs to be held accountable for offenses larger than this one . " it 's really weird that conway would choose to so casually sit like this during such a seemingly ceremonious meeting , " trump said , according to the new york times . " as someone on twitter astutely pointed out , ' shoes on the couch couch couch are least of our concerns . " in a tweet , conway elaborated : " if anything , we could all use some laughter . " he added : " i 'd like to apologize if i had been offended by the fact that i was offended by my comments . i did n't know what was going on , but i had to say thank you . i am sorry for the loss of my life . " conway , on the other hand , called the president a " coward , " adding , " i do n't want to be a president . i can ’ t believe it . i don ’ t know what it ’ s going to happen . i ’ m going to have to do it . i ’ ll never forget it .
