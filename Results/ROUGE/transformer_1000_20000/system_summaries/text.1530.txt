the army corps of engineers is offering help with a program called operation blue roof that allows residents to stay in their homes instead of paying for temporary housing or hotels , the washington post reports . the program sends fiber-reinforced tarps to homeowners to cover damaged roofs until they can arrange repairs . the program also protects property while homeowners recover from the storm , which is a free service to homeowners with homes that have less than 50 % structural damage . according to consumerist , the problem is that the number was wrong before the tweet was pulled : " we ’ ve reached out to the us army of engineers as well as , and will update this post if we hear back . though we haven ’ t yet gotten a response , " says one twitter user . the correct number , which has since been taken down , is 1-888-roof-blu , not 1-800-roof-blu . at least some people were paying attention to the original tweet , however , as the post puts it , " hot ladies are waiting to talk to guys , and women can talk to “ interesting and exciting guys ” for free , apparently , women do not get hot guys .
