ken cuccinelli 's tweet about the death of osama bin laden continues : " you wanted to end the americans ' liberty , so they gave you death ! " he continues . " this is why i allowed the federal government to provide for the common defense ! " henry punches on the nose . " he drops a large weight on osama 's knee . osama is subject to similar beatings from john randolph of roanoke , james monroe , and 65 other people who have the same love for liberty and america . as he writhes on the ground , thomas jefferson picks him up from behind . " i told you there would be 72 waiting for you . what did you think i said ? " but he 's not sure if this is an example of a bit of tweet-snark gone terribly wrong , notes the los angeles times . " how much would i give to be one of the 72 virginans osama is 'hanging out ' with since sunday ? does he really want to service bin laden , sexually , in the great beyond ? maybe an account that 's been hacked , " he writes . " it 's not what i was promised ! "
