" the hawaiian humane society says there are about 300,000 feral cats on the island of oahu , and that they 're not native to hawaii , where they have n't ingested water or prey , the guardian reports . the seals are also calling for a way to shrink their population , either through adoption or through what a noaa coordinator calls " humane euthanization .
