if you 're looking for a snake , you 're not alone . a new study finds that the southeast asian snake 's flattened aerodynamic properties are much more sophisticated than previously thought , livescience reports . " the shape is unusual , " says study author jake socha . " you never find this kind of shape in any other animal ; you do n't find it in engineered . we did n't know if that was a good shape to have . " the study , published in the journal of experimental biology , found that the snake 's tail compares the snake to its tail , but it does n't seem like it 's swimming in the air , livescience notes . it 's not the first time the snake has been able to glide on a plane 's size , but scientists have n't yet figured out how much the snake would be able to do so . the study 's lead author says that while the snake does n't have the ability to fly , it does have a lot to do with it , and that 's why the snake is so favorable for the snakes , which tend to be bigger than the other two species . the study also looked at the interplay between the snake and the animal 's ability to climb into the air . the scientists say they 've figured out a way to conserve the snake , but they do n't have to worry about how much it is . ( another recent study found snakes have been tripping over the snake . )
