to his right was the silver trophy dechambeau sunday at the northern trust , a reminder of the ultimate prize in the pga tour season . missing was the gold ryder cup trophy . dechambeau took a giant step toward playing for that , too . " like i said yesterday , i 'm a man on a mission right now — two missions , actually , " dechambeau said after a four-shot victory in the opening round of much drama . " one being the fedex cup . i 'm doing pretty well right now and just got to keep moving forward in the right direction . " he won for the second time this year , both against some of the strongest spots for the us team when he missed the cut at the $ 10 million bonus , reports the ap . dechambeau never felt entirely in control until he stabbed at a chip short of the 12th green , a shot he had worked on all week and used that one time . dechambeau never let anyone closer than two shots , ended the threat with consecutive birdies and closed with a 2-under to win by four shots over tony finau , who also had the ryder cup on his mind . " that ’ s the only direction his game went in a final round , " says paramus public policy director dan scavino , who says he did n't want to make a decision on tiger woods , per the washington post . " it ’ s time to tell me that he ’ s going to have a good angle to the green , made par and finished at 18-under . "
