the environmental protection agency says it 's investigating a toxic plume of orange-ish muck from colorado to new mexico , the ap reports . according to the ap , the animas river was closed to the <unk> river near durango , where the sludge flowed through cement creek and into the animas valley . the sludge smelled of sediment and metals flowing out of the mine , and it 's not clear what toxins are present in the river . " this decision was made in the interest of public health after consultation with the sheriff to close the mine and access contaminated water , " says a spokesman for the epa in denver . " the closure , which applies to all all devices , is in effect indefinitely until the river is deemed safe , " the epa said in a statement . the epa says it is investigating the discharge and is investigating whether it will pump and treat the water and reduce carbon emissions . the river was evacuated thursday , but officials say there was no threat to the sludge , which could cause serious damage to the mine . the mine is expected to recover at least three days .
