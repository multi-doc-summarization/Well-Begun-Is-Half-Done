two explosions in the white house and barack obama is injured after the dow jones industrial average plunged within minutes , the ap reports . the dow , which had been up about 130 points , fell into the red within two minutes , and then bounced back just as quickly as it became obvious that the “ news ” was false , and a prank . white house spokesman jay carney quickly got on the air and dismissed the story . “ the president is fine , ” he said . “ i was just with him. ” the dow was at 14698 when the bogus tweet hit . within seconds , the dow had dropped 127 points and fallen into the abyss after a tweet from the associated press twitter account claimed that there was no incident . the ap has a copy of the tweet , which was posted to twitter , reports the washington post , which notes that it was retweeted more than an hour later . the ap 's sources say the hack was fake minutes later , and it 's not clear whether the account had been hacked , but it 's unclear whether the hack had anything to do with it .
