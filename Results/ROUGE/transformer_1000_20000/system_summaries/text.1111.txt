a new study by the university of illinois finds that the tsa is trying to figure out how to reduce lines at airports across the country , reports the new york times . the study found that if the tsa waived the $ 85 million fee , it would lose out on $ 425 million a year in order to save the money and speed up the screening process . the study , published in the journal annals of internal medicine , found that 25 million people have signed up for the program , dubbed tsa precheck , and similar programs for international travelers . but the tsa has promoted precheck since it makes the air system more secure , provides faster security screening options for all travelers , and reduces tsa screening costs . " the additional benefits of a more secure air system and faster security throughput makes the no-cost option a viable strategy for some travelers , " says lead researcher sheldon jacobson . the study looked at data from the urbana-champaign campus who offered the idea as a solution to the tsa 's growing budget costs and long lines . " the tsa had hoped to get 25 million travelers to use the precheck lines at the nation 's airports , " he says .
