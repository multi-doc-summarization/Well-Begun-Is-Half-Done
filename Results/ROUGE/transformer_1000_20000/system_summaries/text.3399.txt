robin quivers is getting a lot of flak after he met his second wife on rolling stone last night . " i thought i 'd kind of done what i needed to do . i still enjoyed it , but i also found that i wanted time to do some other things . right now , my schedule is pretty much the same as it 's always been . and then as time rolls on i 'll probably do about three shows a week , " he said , per the new york daily news . " i could sense them all with us . and i did my job . " stern , who has been off the air ever since 1994 , is now in the midst of a radio interview with howard stern that airs tonight . " when you got into your girlfriend being dry [ during sex ] , that 's when i knew i hit a home run . you hit it . but i brought you there . i knew my audience was going out of their minds . " stern 's reply : " i do n't even feel strong enough within myself or that i 'd be doing the right thing by him . "
