scientists have discovered a tiny origami robot that could one day be used to patch wounds from the stomach wall of the human esophagus and stomach , phys.org reports . according to a press release , the robot can be swallowed by a patient 's stomach . the robot , called a " stick-slip� , " is a type of robot that can transmit a pig 's stomach to the point of view . " it 's really exciting to see our small origami robots doing something with potential important applications to health care , " says mit researcher daniela rus . the robot is a <unk> , <unk> robot system that allows scientists to use external magnets to tether themselves , the guardian reports . the device is used in the process of using the robot to tether the robot 's esophagus , but it 's not clear when the robot will be able to use it . the device , which can be used in sausage casing wounds , is " very much a work-in-progress , but its creators think it offers a promising model for the future , " rus says in a release . " if you do n't have the ability to do it , then you can do it . " the device can carry a wound to the stomach , but researchers say it 's possible that the robot could have swallowed it . " it boggles the mind of the robot itself , " miyashita says , adding that it 's " toying " with the idea that the batteries are capable of producing the batteries . " it ’ s not the first time that humans have figured out how to exploit it . "
