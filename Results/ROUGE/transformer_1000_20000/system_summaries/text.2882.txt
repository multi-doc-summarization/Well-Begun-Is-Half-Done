bernie sanders is n't going to vote for donald trump , but he does n't have a chance to win the iowa caucuses . " i think i 'm ready to admit that i 'm the only one who truly has the balls to bust up big business , " he said , per the hill . " i 've never seen anything like that . " he added , " i 'm not sure what it is , " adding , " it 's time to do that . " the new york times , meanwhile , reports that the two super pacs supporting ted cruz 's presidential campaign are offering to donate $ 1.5 million to trump that help veterans if trump will debate him . the ap notes that the debate will be held in iowa or before jan. 31 , and the washington post reports that it 's not the first time the debate has been in place , with the ap reporting that it has n't been seen since the election , but it 's unclear whether it will be a big night for cruz . the ap has a roundup of reactions : chris cillizza , washington post : it 's a " persuasive choice " for sanders , who 's been " noncommittal " about what he 'd like to say about trump 's plans for the debate , which he sees as a " piece of humor in the white house . " he also notes that he has n't spoken to clinton about the 2016 election , though he did n't say whether he 'd win the election . " it was a very good night for the voters , and it was very hard to see that , "
