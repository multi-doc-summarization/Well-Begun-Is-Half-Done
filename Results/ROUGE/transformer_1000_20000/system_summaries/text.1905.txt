a wisconsin woman is suing online retailers for $ 250 if you even threaten to complain about purchase if you were put off by kleargear.com 's ridiculous " non-disparagement fee , " the new york times reports . according to a lawsuit filed wednesday , cindy cox says she was " going to call my bank to cancel this charge , " and that " the only way to resolve the issue is by traveling to new york city for an arbitration hearing . and this is apparently neither a joke nor an exaggerated policy made in the hope that someone will be too scared of the fine to do so within the 90 day period , or it is a breach of the terms of sale , creating liability for damages in the amount of $ 250 , plus any additional fees . " you agree not to file any complaint , chargeback , claim , " she says . " i ’ m going to write about this on facebook . " the lawsuit , which accuses the french government of violating its contract , accuses cox of " overreaching restrictions " on the customer 's credit cards , and accuses the public of violating the privacy act . " the sole method of dispute resolution in all cases… shall be binding arbitration to take place , with all expenses paid by the respective government , " cox says . " the company will tag you for $ <unk> . and even if you wait the full 90 days for that period to end . " the suit also accuses her of trying to go one further , noting that it was fined $ 250 for telling the truth to the customer , the times reports .
