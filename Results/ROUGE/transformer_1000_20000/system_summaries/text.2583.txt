a 15-year-old girl who went missing from a rental cottage in ontario on tuesday was cautioned for misuse of the emergency number , the cbc reports . according to the cbc , stephen bates , 19 , called 911 last week to find out what was going on . " this appeared to be a case of a teenager being a real issue , it was not an appropriate use of 911. , " bates says . " although she perceived this as a tie up police resources which could impact the safety of others in the community who are in real need of assistance . " police say the girl was safe and interviewing all occupants to confirm that it was just a family vacation , but they say they have n't been notified of the girl 's disappearance . " i 've never seen anything like this , " says bates , who has been on the run for a few years . " i do n't know what to do , but i 'm not going to be here , " he says . " i 'm going to get a little bit of help . " police are investigating the case , which is being held on $ 2,500 bond .
