a new report from the fda finds that dark chocolate bars contain milk . the fda says it 's " a problem , since even one small bite of a product containing milk can cause a dangerous reaction in some individuals , " reports the los angeles times . it 's not the first time the fda has found a correlation between milk consumption and the distribution of dark chocolate , but it does n't appear to be the case , reports the new york times . " it 's actually the milk . most of the time it 's casein. , " says a researcher at the chocolate factory that could have milk . the upshot is that the milk is n't always listed in the ingredients , but the fda is n't buying it . " i would say no dark chocolate unless you had an absolute declaration on the bar that you were absolutely certain from the manufacturer that it was made in a milk free facility and it was completely clear of that , ‚Äù says one of the researchers , who notes that the fda 's findings are based on the fact that the bars have been on the label incorrectly , and that they 're not the only ones that have n't been tested for it . " we have a lot of people who do n't know what it 's going to do . "
