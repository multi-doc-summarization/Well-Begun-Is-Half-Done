if you 're looking for a lottery drawing , you 're going to have to pay $ 31,000 for the lottery . that 's the plight of the pacific maritime association , which says it 's " a big deal . it 's a good job , it has good benefits , " the company says in a statement , per the los angeles times . the company 's ceo , patrick meehan , tells the times that the cards will be sent out for a decade or so . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " he says , adding that he 's not sure how many cards we have gotten so far . but the company has n't released any details on the drawing , and it says it will " get as many as a million cards " for the next wave of part-time employees . the deadline is thursday for most of the post cards to have their hands on the cards , and the new york times reports that it 's the first time the international longshore and warehouse union employees have been able to buy tickets for the past few days . the times notes that even if they do n't have the money , they 'll have to wait a few weeks to figure out what to do .
