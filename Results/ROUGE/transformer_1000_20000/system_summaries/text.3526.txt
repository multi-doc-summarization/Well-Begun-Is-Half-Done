megyn kelly is n't exactly a fan of megyn kelly , but she 's not the only one she 's talking about . in a tweet wednesday night , sean hannity said she " clearly supports hillary clinton , " and that " she is not in a place where she feels uncomfortable or anything unexpected could come at her , which does n't exactly extend the tent . " she added : " they 're both in their own version of a presidential protection program , " adding , " i do n't know what to do about it . " she also added that she " supports clinton . " " i think it 's time for her to do that , " she said . " it 's a matter of time . " the tweet came after kelly 's tweet , and the new york daily news reports that it was n't the first time kelly spoke publicly about kelly 's comments , and that she did n't speak to kelly about the tweet . " i was just trying to talk to u , " kelly said . " it was a joke . i was n't going to talk about it . i did n't know how to do it . i did not know what it was like . " she later clarified that she was speaking to hannity about the issue , and she did not have the " unsafe spaces these days . " the washington post , meanwhile , has a transcript of kelly 's interview with hannity , who was also directed at the fox news personality , the hill reports .
