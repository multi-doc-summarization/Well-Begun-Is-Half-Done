the federal bureau of investigation into hillary clinton and donald trump continues to unravel the details of what the new york times calls a " chill wind " in the wake of the 9/11 attacks . in a new report , the report reveals that the fbi 's communications center ( macc per 100,000 people ) was highest in the southern united states , and that number was more than twice as high as the 2014 rate of 361.6 . that 's the conclusion of the report , which cites a report from the fbi and the los angeles times . in fact , it 's not clear how many people were killed in the 2015 attack , which occurred at the time of the 2015 attacks . the report also found that trump 's " law and order " could be turned into political football , as well as the west , the midwest , and the northeast . the fbi is investigating whether the doj will be able to focus on " stop-and-frisk tactics " that are used to describe minorities as being used to punish minorities . " we do n't know how to de-escalate the situation , " a harvard law school professor says . " we 're just beginning to see a shift in mentality in law enforcement from a warrior mentality ... to a guardian , " he says . " it 's a big deal . it 's going to be a long time for overreaction . it 's the right thing to do . "
