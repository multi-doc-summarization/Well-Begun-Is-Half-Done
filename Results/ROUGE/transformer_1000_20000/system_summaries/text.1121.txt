harry reid 's decision to use the nuclear option to change the senate 's nuclear option if republicans ended up weakening the filibuster . " this will kill the senate , " he said , according to the hill . " the crisis could still be averted . " the senate would lose a crucial check on majority leader mitch mcconnell , who is expected to vote with the majority party , but it 's expected that biden would drop the threat of the filibuster , reports the new york times . reid , meanwhile , said he would support the effort , but he did n't think it would happen , reports politico . " i think the senate exists because the founding fathers , who hated the idea of a senate , gave in to vice president joe biden , " said reid . " what they â€™ re threatening to do is to eliminate the newest and most abusive use of the <unk> filibuster . " reid , however , said that the senate is " not even going to kill the filibuster . " he added that if the filibuster goes , it would hurt them one day when they were back in the chamber , and that 's not the case . the senate has been trying to rein it in , too , notes the washington post , which calls it a " 50-50 tie . "
