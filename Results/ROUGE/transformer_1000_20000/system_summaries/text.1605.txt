the wall street journal is out with a look at what it sees as a " bleak outlook " for groupon , writes megan mcardle at the new york times . it 's " a hell of a ride , " she writes . " there is no way i would own groupon 's stock for the next few quarters at this price . " but it 's not all bad news for investors , writes mcardle . " the future of the stock , you have to know two things : the future cash flows eastward into the <unk> . " but felix salmon at the washington post thinks it 's time for groupon to be " a little less <unk> . " " if you were a big institutional investor , i 'd be watching the next act from the sidelines , " he writes . " but that 's not enough , it 's a good thing to do . " if groupon does n't seem to be willing to shell out $ 8 billion a share , it would have to pay for it , and it would n't be too late to make it a little more money than it did in the last few years .
