lady gaga 's religious firestorm is over , and it 's a doozy of a new album . the lebanese government says it 's impounded " born this way , " and that the singer 's religious affiliations are " offensive to christianity , " the guardian reports . " the space age artist should n't be too surprised by the country 's reception of the full album . " the already-platinum album is getting stellar reviews in the us , but overseas , in lebanon , 'born this way ' is n't getting the same warm reception , " gaga says in a statement . " this is a stunt ... lady gaga tries to continue to shock catholics and christians in general : she dresses as a nun ... she has now morphed into a caricature of herself . " the video , which was banned from lebanon 's radio stations in 2004 , has been banned from the country , but it 's not clear how many copies of the album were impounded by the time gaga was born . " i think gaga is pushing the envelope too far ? " she says , adding that it 's " convoluted and imagery laid to rest any criticism from the us catholic league . "
