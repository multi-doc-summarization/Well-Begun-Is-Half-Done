george zimmerman is back in the wake of the trayvon martin shooting , and he 's not going anywhere anytime soon . " i just try to be smart where i go , " he told the orlando sentinel last night . " he 's constantly receiving death threats . " he added that he carries a semi-automatic handgun for added safety . " it 's so odd to me , " zimmerman said , according to cnn . " it is appreciated . " zimmerman , whose twitter feed is a constant barrage of criticism or palpable hatred , was not immediately charged with disorderly conduct . zimmerman , who was invited to the arms room to speak for a photo shoot at a firearms expo in lake mary , ga. , on feb. 26 , is expected to be released later this year . zimmerman 's first interview since he was killed in a road-rage incident in sanford , la. , on saturday , is now a " friendly " event that did n't warrant extra protection . " it was unfortunately necessary right now . " zimmerman is n't the only one making headlines , but he has n't commented on what he 's talking about . " i do n't think he has a reason to be hidden from the public , " says zimmerman . " and it 's part of life , " adds a rep for the national concealed carry association . " the polarizing case that made zimmerman a household name captured the world 's attention for more than a year . "
