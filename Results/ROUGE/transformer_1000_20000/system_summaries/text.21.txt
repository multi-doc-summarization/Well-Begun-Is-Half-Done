duck dynasty star phil is taking flak for his portrayal of the duck dynasty , but he 's not wearing one . " i 'm sitting in the passenger seat of a & e , " he tells the new york times . " i 've never seen anything like that . " he says he has no plans to be disciplined , but " it 's a loaded .22-caliber rifle around in the footwell . " in a statement , he says , " we have no idea what to do about it , " but he does n't want phil to think i â€™ m a pussy . " " he is a man who preaches the gospel of the outdoors and , to my great envy , practices what he calls " a crossbow . " " i am not wearing any kind of weapon , " phil tells the times , which notes that he has n't spoken to the public about the " whole ride " in the past two years . " i think it 's time to get a little bit more attention , but i do n't think it will happen again . "
