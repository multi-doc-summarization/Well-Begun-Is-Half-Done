donald trump 's handling of a question at a town hall event in rochester , ny , friday night was n't the only thing he 's talking about . " you know our current president is one . you know he 's not even an american , " he said , per the hill . " that 's my question : when can we get rid of them ? " he added , referring to nikolas cruz as " an unidentified man who interrupted the man , wearing a " trump t-shirt , continued , " we need this question . this is the first question . anyway , we have training camps growing where they want to kill us . we 're going to be looking at a lot of different things . " trump , who has shaken off several high-profile controversies that would have ended other presidential campaigns , said he 's " appalled " by the remarks . " i am morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him ? i do n't think so ! " he asked the crowd to question whether the president should be muslim . " we 're not talking about it , " the man said . " it is anybody really surprised that this happened at a donald trump rally ? " the washington post reports that trump 's remarks were " just plain wrong , " and that the question was whether he was referring to trump 's " racist tendencies . "
