rush limbaugh says he 's " the one that does n't do it . i do n't use my show for activism . i said , 'if i did it , i would shut the place down . so i 'll demonstrate it for you . " limbaugh , who has only done so once before , says he was writing a profile of him in the 1990 's for us news & world report . " the same thing happened today at the two toll-free and the toll-call numbers i gave , " he says . " those numbers have now . you do n't even get a recording at them now . they 're invalidated . nothing happens . so we had to give out the phone numbers of members of congress and switchboards in washington . " limbaugh says the republicans do n't have the votes to stop this . " republicans may as well be martians on this given their influence . all we can do is continue to have the american people let it be known they want no part of this -- the substance of the bill or the process . they do n't like it . and that 's why i am urging -- because this is a transformation of our country into something that no one has ever seen it be like . and we do n't want that transformation to take place . we like america as it was founded .
