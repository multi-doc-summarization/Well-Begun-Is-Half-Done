the white house says it 's looking into a " bad framework that will lead to a bad and dangerous deal . " that 's what the washington post calls a " tentative deal " that would have irked iran 's nuclear deal , which would have required iran to conduct a nuclear weapon . the new york times reports that the meeting was tentatively scheduled for april , and it 's unclear whether iran will be able to do so . it 's not the first time the senate will vote on the deal , but it 's expected to vote on it . iran 's foreign minister , ernie moniz , says the deal is " not because we were up early. . " in a statement , corker said he was " disappointed " by the decision . " we have no idea how to proceed with the agreement , " he said , per the ap . " we will not allow any further action to proceed . " corker , chair of the senate foreign relations committee , said the deal would " continue its centrifuge research and development " into the next-generation centrifuge designs , which are far more efficient than the relatively crude devices iran used to have been used in the past . he said the agreement would be " limited " to the centrifuges , and that it " would be impossible to tell the truth .
