bruce v. boardwine , the husband of the gestational age group , says he 's expected to be a part of the child 's life . the court of appeals ruled tuesday that the boy , who was born in a way that did n't involve sexual intercourse , was never alone with the child , the guardian reports . the ruling came after a judge ruled that the child had a " donor , other than a surrogate , who contributes the sperm or egg used in assisted pregnancy . " it 's not the parent of a child conceived through assisted medical treatment , " says boardwine , a longtime friend of bruce <unk> . " it is a donor . " the ruling , which is expected next month , slaps a fetus on her own , without the involvement of a father . boardwine says she never asked him to visit or to care for the child . she says that when she returned home from the hospital , she would n't agree with any parental rights . " i do n't know what to do about it , " she says . " it was just a matter of time . it was a very stressful situation . it was n't a good thing to do . " the court 's decision is expected to determine whether the fetus was pregnant , and the judge will decide whether to proceed with the fetus .
