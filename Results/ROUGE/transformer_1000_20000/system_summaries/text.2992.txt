a new study suggests that humans are n't the only ones to blame . researchers at the universities of exeter and zurich say they 've found that a type of bird known as babbler birds do the same thing , the bbc reports . the study , published in plos biology , found that the birds are capable of stringing different sounds together as part of a complex song . the researchers say the sounds of the birds ' sounds within a song does n't alter its arrangement , but they do n't think the birds were the only species that could communicate by looking at the nests when they heard a feeding call . " it 's a very basic form of word , " the lead researcher tells the bbc . " it was previously thought that animals , particularly birds , have their own thoughts . " the researchers found that they had n't been able to manipulate the sounds , and that they were able to find a correlation between the two arrangements , the guardian reports . " we had a lot of sounds , " says one researcher . " but we didn â€™ t know what to do . "
