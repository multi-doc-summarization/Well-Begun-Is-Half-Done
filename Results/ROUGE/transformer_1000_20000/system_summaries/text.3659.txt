" everyone is affected , " says robert m. hathaway , a professor of mideast studies . " the problem is implementation , and finding the political backbone to make the tough decisions needed to pay for fuel , so their plants slow or shut down entirely . " sharif <unk> , a former steel baron who worked for sharif , says he was " 110 % sure " of the plan . " i can ’ t pay their salaries , " he says , adding that " if we can only work a few hours every day ? " he adds , " it ’ s not like finding a cure for cancer people . " the times notes that the taliban has been trying to figure out how to fix the problem , but it has n't done enough to rein it in . the times has a piece headlined " how can i be done ? "
