the infowars hack of infowars and the infowars platform that sparked the furor on social credit holt has been banned from the site , but it 's not clear whether the site will be bowing to the controversy . the new york times reports that the ban , which was spearheaded by george soros , is widely seen as a dog whistle for paypal to ban infowars . " the decision is blatantly political given the fact that the mid-terms are now just weeks away , " the group 's channel says in a statement . " this is yet another example of a competing media outlet abusing its core values . " paypal , for its part , says it is investigating " a comprehensive review of the platform â€™ s own terms of fair use , " and that it " promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions. . " the post notes that the group has not commented on the controversy , but the verge points out that it 's " not a political ploy . " it 's a sentiment echoed by paypal founder mark <unk> , who writes that " the crusade to ban alex jones and infowars is the ultimate culmination of what it sees as an implicit rebuke to infowars .
