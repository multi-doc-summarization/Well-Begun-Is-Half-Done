a new study out of the university of southern california finds that the number of people who never would have smoked cigarettes is increasing , reports the los angeles times . the study looked at e-cigarettes between 1995 and 2014 , and found that those who consumed e-cigarettes were now more likely to have smoked pot . the study , published in pediatrics , looked at data from more than 14.7 million people over the last 30 days . the study found that teens who reported the use of e-cigarettes had a higher number of calories per day , while those numbers were higher than those who did n't burn tobacco use . the lead researcher says the findings are based on data from the endocrine society of public health . " we do n't know how much the data is going to be , " he says . " it 's going to have a lot more impact on e-cigarettes . " the researchers say that while the study reinforces the point of view , it does n't seem to be applicable to the overall number of studies in the us and elsewhere in the world , the lead author of the study says there 's a lot of evidence suggesting that e-cigarettes are now stronger than they did in the 1990s . " we have a very strong correlation with causation , " she says . " we are still analyzing the data , and we are analyzing it . "
