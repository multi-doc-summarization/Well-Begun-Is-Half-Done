a new study in the american journal of preventive medicine finds that women who worked rotating shifts for more than five years had an 11 % increased risk of death from all causes . researchers looked at 22 years of data from 75,000 nurses across the united states and found that the risk of heart disease was 19 % higher among those who worked such shifts for six to 14 years , the los angeles times reports . " these results add to prior evidence of a potentially detrimental relation of rotating night shift work and health , " the study 's lead author says in a press release . the study looked at more than three nights per month , and the researchers found no link between night and evenings in the same month . the study also looked at the shift work as at least three nights in length , the guardian reports . the study , which was conducted by harvard medical school and associate professor eva schernhammer , looked at 75,000 registered shifts in the month prior to the study . the lead researcher says the study is " very troubling . " he says that while the researchers did n't prove causation , they did find a correlation between lung cancer and cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality rates and the effects of lung cancer in those who had worked as a night shift for 15 or more years . the researchers say that while they were more likely to have a modest increase in lung cancer rates , they were n't surprised to see the increase . " it 's a big step forward , " one researcher says . " it â€™ s hard to think about it . "
