ruth bader ginsburg is in the midst of a supreme court decision upholding the same-sex marriage ban , but she 's not the only one to do so . in a written statement friday , ginsburg says she 's " a friend and someone i much admire , " the ap reports . " the private ceremony will take place at the kennedy center for the performing arts , a national memorial to president john f. kennedy and john roberts , " she wrote . " that is why i am at his wedding . " she added that she supports the decision , and that " i think that everything that 's going on that makes same-sex marriage possible and visible helps to encourage others and to make the issue seem less of an issue , to make it just more part of life . " the washington post reports that the court 's decision to expand federal recognition of same-sex marriage to gay couples has been " fruitless , " and it 's not clear whether it will be a first for a member of america 's highest court . the post notes that the supreme court ruled in favor of doma 's doma decision , but it 's unclear whether the justices will be able to enjoy the wedding .
