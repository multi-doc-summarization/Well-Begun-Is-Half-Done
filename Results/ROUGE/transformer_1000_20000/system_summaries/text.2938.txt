president obama 's move to the white house is " a bold step in the right direction , " reports the washington post . " it 's courageous , it 's as good as it can be under the law , " he said , according to the ap . " but that does n't mean we would n't like to have a bill , and some of the provisions will have to take a little time to be implemented . " the move comes after obama 's speech to the senate judiciary committee on immigration reform , the new york times reports . " i think it 's time for the republicans to come forward , " obama said , adding that he 's " not " how our democracy works . " he added that the president 's decision to take executive action on immigration will " continue to focus on the immigration system . " he also called on obama to step down , saying , " i do n't think that 's what i will do . " the president , meanwhile , is expected to announce a speech today that will address the executive actions of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country illegally . the ap reports that obama 's address has been widely seen as a sign of support for president obama , but it 's not clear whether he will be able to address the issue .
