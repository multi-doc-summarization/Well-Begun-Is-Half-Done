wildlife officials in thailand have begun removing some of the tigers held at a controversial buddhist temple following accusations that the monks were involved in illegal breeding and trafficking of the animals . the temple , a popular money-earning tourist attraction in the western province of kanchanaburi , has been criticized by animal rights activists because of allegations it is not properly set up to care for the animals and flouted their trade . the animals will be taken to three government animal refuges in an operation involving about 1,000 state personnel that is expected to continue for a week , the ap reports . more than 300 officials remained at the temple overnight to ensure the tigers remained safe . " yesterday was mayhem , " wildlife conservation office director teunjai noochdumrong told cnn . " when our vet arrived , there were tigers roaming around everywhere . looks like the temple intentionally let these tigers out , trying to obstruct our work . " he added that three tigers were posed a danger to visitors and that they were being mistreated . a tourist poses for a photo with a tiger at the thai temple in 2012 . however , when staff from the wco arrived monday morning to remove the tigers , temple officials refused to let them in . after a half-day stand off , wildlife officers finally entered and were able to sedate eight tigers . the temple recently made arrangements to operate as a zoo , but the plan fell through when the government determined that the operators failed to secure sufficient resources .
