the aclu has filed a complaint with detroit 's justice department , claiming that the city 's desire to hide homeless people from the popular greektown entertainment district is " inhumane , callous and illegal . " the complaint filed by the aclu states that andrew sheehan , 37 , was " subjected to this abusive and unlawful treatment on multiple occasions , " the detroit free press reports . the complaint alleges that andrew and his brother , dennis , were taken for a ride to the property , and that they were told they are not welcome in the church . " they 're being approached and harassed by police , not necessarily for anything they â€™ re doing , but just because of the way that they look , " says a police rep . " they do n't have a problem with that . " the aclu says it 's investigating the matter , but it 's not clear whether the church will be able to provide further comment without reviewing the specific stories , the ap reports . " we have no idea what to do with the specific facts , " aclu attorney sarah mehta says . " it 's a matter of time , and it 's going to be inappropriate . " the letter , which has been shared more than 46,000 times , says it has no plans to go to the church unless it 's notified of the incident .
