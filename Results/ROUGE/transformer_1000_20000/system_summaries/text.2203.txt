the fda is trying to figure out how to make it easy for consumers to eat as any food source in their food . the fda today announced that aquadvantage salmon , salmon , and atlantic salmon had been genetically modified , reports the washington post . the move came after a group of genetically modified foods found that the fish could escape and establish themselves in the wild , notes the new york times . the fda said it would not have a significant impact on the environment , but it did n't require food containing ingredients such as <unk> , or salmon . the fda also said it was investigating a possible link between food and salmon production . the agency said in a statement that " the multiple documents explain the application and are not binding . " but the fda did n't say whether the food was produced using genetic engineering or not , and it concluded that it was safe for the fish , and that it had n't been derived from genetically modified sources . the fda has n't commented on the changes , but a spokesman for the national institutes of health tells the post that the guidance is based on a " pattern of neglect . "
