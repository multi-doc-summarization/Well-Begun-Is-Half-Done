bill cosby has been accused of sexual assault by more than 50 women of sexual misconduct , and now the new york times takes a look at what 's going on : " the reality is n't nearly that simple . it 's tempting to think of the case as a slam dunk given that the jury forgets about the other 48 , " says james cohen , a criminal law professor at fordham university , per nbc news . cosby , 79 , faces three counts of aggravated assault for andrea constand , a temple university employee , and two of his accusers . " there is a big contrast . " cosby is on trial for " something that allegedly happened back in 2004â€”when george w. bush was president of the abu ghraib prison where he was acquitted of sexually assault . " i do n't know what i 'm going to do , " he says . " i 've never seen anything like this before . " the times notes that cosby 's lawyers have argued that cosby should n't be allowed to speak freely about the sexual assault allegations , but they have n't been able to speak to the public about the assault allegations . " i think it 's the first time i 've ever seen that , but i 've got a lot of people who 've been in the past , and i 've had a lot to say about it , " cosby says in a statement . " i have no idea what i 've seen in the years . " the los angeles times has a timeline of the interview here .
