the new york times is out with a story headlined " martin bin laden , " and it 's a doozy of a story out of the washington post , which explores how the bush campaign is framing it . " i ca n't make any donations , financially , " he writes . " i have no idea what you are talking about . " but he 's not alone : " we can get a sense of what kind of guy bush turned to for arguably the most crucial job in the world . " he adds that if he does n't want to get the money , he would have to pay $ 50,000 in donations tied to harry sargeant iii , who is currently at the helm of the cia 's torture program . " if you 're going to get a lot of money , you 're not going to have to go to prison . " he says he 's going to return to the us , and he 's " going to be a one-term president . " he 's been trying to figure out how much he 's done , and his lawyers are n't so sure about it , and they 're not sure what he 'll do next . the times notes that bin laden is a former cia officer who 's worked for the cia , and that 's why he 's a lawyer who 's been in jordan since 2008 . the times has a profile on bin laden 's son , stuart , who says bin laden was a " pawn " and " was a sort of jack bauer .
