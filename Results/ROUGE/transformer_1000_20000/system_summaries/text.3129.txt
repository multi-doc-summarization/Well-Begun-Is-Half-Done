taylor swift 's gq photo shoot is getting a lot more attention than this one : she 's not the only one she 's ever seen , but it 's not clear how much she 's talking about . " i wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie , " she tells gq . " i was terribly calculated and mean , and they exceeded all my expectations of rudeness and arrogance . hate . " but she 's also not bending over backward , she says , and she 's been trying to figure out what she 's doing . " it 's a pap , " swift says . " i 've got a lot of laughs , but i 've never seen anything like that . " she adds that she 's " not a fan of anything , " but that she does n't think she 's going to do anything about it . " i do n't know what i 'm talking about . i 'm not going to talk about it . i 'm going to get it . " she says she has no intention of being able to delete her tweets , but she does have a lot to do with it . " it was n't me , it was like , 'ok , you know , ' " she writes . " but it was just a matter of time . "
