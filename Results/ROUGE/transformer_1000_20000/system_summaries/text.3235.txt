president trump says he 's going to be " very angry " if the republican effort to repeal obamaca collapses . " i 'm sitting on the bill to come to my desk . i hope they do n't get it done , " he said , per the washington post . he added that the senate will " continue to work on the 700 club , " and that " we will be very angry about it and a lot of people will be <unk> . " he added , per politico , that the bill is " totally gone . it 's out of business and we have to get this done. " he also called the bill " a failed experiment , " but said it would n't be the first time the senate would vote on criminal justice reform , reports the new york times , which notes that it would require the senate to pass legislation that would require congress to pass a bill that would allow the aca to pass through congress . but the white house says it 's not going to get a vote on the ahca , which is expected to take effect next week . " the president has been promising it ever since obamacare is failed , " trump said in a statement . " they â€™ ve been promising for years . " the bill was signed by mitch mcconnell on wednesday , and it 's unclear how much it will be , but politico reports that it could be the final nail in the coffin .
