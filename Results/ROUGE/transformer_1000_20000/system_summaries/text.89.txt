a new study out of the oregon health & science university finds that stem cells from cloned human embryos could be used for diabetes . the study , published in cell science , found that the stem cells can turn into a human egg , which is then grown into an early embryo , reports the new york times . the researchers , who describe the study as " the first step in the field , " say they 've been able to get rid of cloned embryos for about a decade . the researchers say they have developed a " therapeutic therapeutic " step forward , and they hope that it will lead to more clinical trials in the future . " this is not the first time this has happened , " says lead researcher hwang <unk> , who led the study . " it 's not a matter of time , " he says . " i think it 's going to be a big step forward . " the study found that stem from the nucleus from six embryos created from donated eggs to a child with a genetic disorder known as parkinson 's and diabetes , and the researchers hope to study the results of a clinical trial in the next few years . the scientists say they hope to create a clearer understanding of the body 's dna , which could cause a repeat of the disease 's potential effects .
