" i have had a student who i had an issue with and decided to call his mom while at school and she was disrespectful and rude to me on the phone in front of her son , " julie marburger tells abc news . " and i actually had the class right there with me too and they could hear what she was saying and it was quite embarrassing. . " she says she 's " already made the decision to leave teaching at the end of this year , and today , i do n't know if i will make it even that long . " marburger , who says she was n't allowed to continue for the school , says her parents have been " far too disrespectful , and their children are even worse. ‚Äù she says the post has been shared more than 400,000 times since the report began , and she says it 's " not fair to society , and more importantly , is not fair . the children to teach them this is okay . it will not serve them towards a parenting website that 's going to spread through our society like wildfire , " she adds , adding that " people absolutely have to stop coddling and enabling their children . it 's a problem . " the post notes that souter 's parents , who filed a civil lawsuit against her parents last month , have refused to file a civil suit . " we 've had pictures drawn into books , books that i personally bought for myself , that students have drawn inappropriate pictures in , or inappropriate words . "
