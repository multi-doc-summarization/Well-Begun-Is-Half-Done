britain 's royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists says it 's " mild rejection episodes " in four patients , but the swedish research team says it has " already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready , " the bbc reports . the study , published in the journal of obstetrics and gynecology , found that three or two of the seven women might successfully give birth to her own biological child . " one or two wo n't be able to get pregnant , " says dr. mats brannstrom , a gynecologist at liverpool women 's hospital . " there are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the fetus will be monitored as a pregnancy . " the guardian reports that the women who received a new uterus would have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout the pregnancy . the bbc notes that brannstrom and colleagues described the procedures used to test whether it 's possible to transfer a uterus to cancer or were born without one . " we have no idea what to do about this , " brannstrom says . " it is a promising step forward . "
