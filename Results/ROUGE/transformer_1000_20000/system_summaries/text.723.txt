barnes & noble is phasing out the nook in the nook , but it 's not the only nook in its nook color . engadget reports that the nook is coming ? " received hard evidence from within b & n ; that the company never actually received a huge amount of 3g bulk orders to begin with , so maybe wi-fi is everywhere these days . " the article then goes on to say that engadget 's story about the nook color has been corrected to prove it . " we 're not sure quite what to make of this rumor , but we should point out that it 's a little hard to decipher what this means , " the rep says . " one thing worth pointing out is that it would seem odd for barnes & <unk> to discontinue the 3g/wi-fi version of the nook and tell customers they could only get the wi-fi-only version . " the nook 's rep adds that barnes & n is " encouraging retail partners to not send out any 'bulk requests ' for the 3g , as there simply 'will not be sufficient quantities to fulfill those orders . "
