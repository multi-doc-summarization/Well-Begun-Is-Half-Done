the cuban government says it 's looking into reports that a sonic weapon used to harass people in the us embassy in havana , but it 's not clear whether the microwave energy was destined to be used for airport traffic control . the new york times reports that the cubans were employing a microwave generator , which was supposed to be embedded within the embassy 's acoustic wave . " the pressures are many orders of magnitude too weak to cause tissue damage . they elicit only because of the exquisite sensitivity of the human auditory system , and represent a near-threshold phenomenon . you could use a much higher radar radar , " says a researcher . the report also found that the microwave contained a beam at a person 's head , and that the subject was some distance away from a military radar set . " there are simpler ways to detect people if that is the goal , " he says . but the cubans ' theory is that they were n't able to detect the microwave sensations in the microwave , but they would n't have to know if they were actually used in the email . the times notes that it 's unclear if the note originated in cuba .
