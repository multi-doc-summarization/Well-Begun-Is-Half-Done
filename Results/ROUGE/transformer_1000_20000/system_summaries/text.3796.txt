cnn anchor chris cuomo is taking flak over the spelling bee bias controversy over the 2017 national spelling bee . in a thursday tweet , the sixth-grader said she was " used to using ” sanskrit . “ it ’ s a nonsense word , ” she wrote . “ so , we ’ re not sure that its root is actually in sanskrit , which is what you ’ re probably , uh , used to find the origin of a word . " she added , " i don ’ t know . anyway , it is a joke . to assign a bias to what was a fun and innocent segment . " the sixth-grader , who happens to be indian american indian , uses sanskrit to describe indian recycling as " marocain , " reports the washington post . the interview was not the first time the anchor joked about being the author of the " covfefe " in an earlier discussion about the problem . " i think it was a mistake , " she said , per the new york daily news . she added that the comment was " frankly cynical , " but that it was n't meant to be a joke . " it was not a joke , but it was merely a metaphor , " the spokesperson added , adding that the girl 's comment " is not insignificant . "
