the tech world is abuzz today with a report alleging that the tech giant is trying to rein in the web . the new york times reports that general motors and audi ag said the company is working with google to fix the problem , but it 's not going to be able to do so . the wall street journal reports that the open alliance has agreed to create a " <unk> " mobile app that allows users to opt out of the device , which can be used for wifi . the journal says it 's " a stance that makes sense given the safety and concerns they face . " the journal sees the move as " the first step of the international consumer electronics show in las vegas , " noting that the company 's chief technology officer calls it " a step forward " and says the company has " no plans to do anything to prevent the company from developing its own software . " but the journal notes that the journal 's sources say that while the company does n't have the ability to connect the dots , it does n't seem to be working hard to get the data done , and the journal reports google has already implemented a software glitch in the past five years .
