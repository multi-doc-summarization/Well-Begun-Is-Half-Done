the washington post reports that earth 's water is so old that the sun , brewed in the same cloud of dust from which the sun would go on to form the solar system . that 's the conclusion of a paper published thursday in science . researchers found the ratio of deuterium , or heavy hydrogen to hydrogen , would have been in the process of leaving earth to go alone in stirring up its own water . " if water can survive a star 's birthing process , and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did , that means that water might be a common ingredient in the making of other planets far from our own , " says a researcher . " by identifying the ancient heritage of earth â€™ s water , we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique , and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water , " he adds . the research builds on the sun 's birth band , which means that some of our water must be grown in abundance . so what 's next ? scientists have n't commented on how or when the water got here , but the post notes that it 's not clear if the water was destroyed in the disk , but it does n't look like the sun will have to wait for a sip , ponder the paper 's director says .
