george lucas has apologized for criticizing disney 's handling of star wars and saying he had sold his characters to " white slavers , " the new york times reports . " it 's not clear what he meant , and rose did n't ask a follow-up question on his pbs show , " lucas said in a statement . " i want to do is tell a story'â€¦ they decided they did n't want to use those [ my ] stories . " lucas added that he was against making the new movie " for the fans " and felt he sold the company he created , lucasfilm , to " break up " with star wars : the force awakens with $ 4 billion in 2012 , the ap reports . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " he said . " but i do n't think it was a hoax . " he added that the movie was " very hard thing to do , " and that it was " somewhat surprising because lucas has previously seemed to have been supportive of the movie . " i think it 's a very very inappropriate analogy . i think we 've got a lot of laughs , but i 'm not going to have a conversation about it . "
