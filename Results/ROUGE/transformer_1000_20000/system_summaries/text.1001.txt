the daily caller is out with a story headlined " guns and gear " : " the gun 's manufacturer , jim pontillo , has attacked american progressives for supposedly seeking to promote secession . " that 's the conclusion of a daily caller op-ed by matt gertz , who writes that the site is " running on the website 's nra-sponsored . " it 's not the first time the gun has been used in the past , but it 's also a " demeaning exploitation " of underage kids . " it ’ s just a matter of time , and i ’ ve never seen anything like this , " he writes . " i don ’ t know what it is , but i ’ ll never have to say anything about it . i ’ m going to have to do something about it . " the editor of the new york times , meanwhile , calls the ad a " perversion of the gun liberation " that " reinforces the point of view , " and says it " does n't want to be used as a weapon of mass destruction . " the editorial , which notes that the editorial page " has come up with an opinion piece of legislation written by <unk> firearms , " says it will be giving away one gun per week until it can be used to create a firearm . " it adds , however , that it will " continue to defend ourselves vigorously " and " we are not fanatics who hate america in america , " but " we do n't have a problem with it . "
