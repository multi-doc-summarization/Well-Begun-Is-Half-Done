mitt romney is in favor of abortion in the wake of the supreme court decision , and he has n't seen a lot about it . " my position has been clear throughout this campaign , " he told cbs news in an interview airing today . " the democrats try and make this a political issue every four years , but this is a matter in the courts . it 's been settled for some time in the case of rape and incest , and the health and life of the mother . " he added that if romney were president , the republican would not " stand in the way " if congress attempted to strip women of their reproductive health rights . " i 'm going to favor abortion being legal in the republican party platform , where in addition to the strong views held by romney 's running mate rep. paul ryan , the party will adopt its national platform . " recognize this is the decision that will be made by the <unk> supreme court , " romney said , adding that pelley is the issue " amounts to a distraction . " romney , meanwhile , said that the " birther joke was n't a swipe at romney , and that he " did n't do it . "
