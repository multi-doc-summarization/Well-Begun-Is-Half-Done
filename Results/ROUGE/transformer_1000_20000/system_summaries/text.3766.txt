" the clintons have been trying to figure out what to do , " he writes . " they have a lot to do with that . " the authors deploy the conversation-driving formula that boxed out of national media coverage for days while lending the documents to the media is " infinite , " and " double down : game change : obama and the clintons , both of whom subtly distort the facts , " write nicholas burns in the los angeles times . " but it â€™ s not just the storm , " says the editorial . " it 's just a matter of time . "
