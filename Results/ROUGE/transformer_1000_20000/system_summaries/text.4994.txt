" the whole country is picking this fight in order to reframe the deficit and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars , then that means we â€™ ve got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship , " he said . " that means that we have to stop funding certain grants for medical research . " he added that the president 's plan is " not a good deal , " and that " medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden , " reports the washington post . " these are the choices we have . the republicans say they want to keep the tax break for corporate jet owners , if we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires , " obama said , adding that he 's " disappointed " about the deficit , which is " a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high end tax cuts .
