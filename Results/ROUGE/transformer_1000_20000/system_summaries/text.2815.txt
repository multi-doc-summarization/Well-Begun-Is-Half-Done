the amur tiger and timur the goat , sharing an enclosure in russia 's far east , have fallen out big time . the park 's director tells russian media that the goat is " currently in good health , he says hi and promises to be less cocky from now on and advises other to keep it smart . " for the moment , he needs to recover , but couldn ’ t , he just lay there in the snow for a while , looking exceptionally sad . little did he know that a tiger would have done it right away , " he says . " instead , he chose to give him a lesson and set him aflame . " the park says it 's too early to tell the tale of the two unlikely buddies jumping up and mauling the goat for a few seconds before throwing him to the ground . " time will tell if we will return him to amur , it ’ s too early , but the goat this latest in their relationship once again goes to prove that for some reason the tiger doesn ’ t want to eat the goat ?
