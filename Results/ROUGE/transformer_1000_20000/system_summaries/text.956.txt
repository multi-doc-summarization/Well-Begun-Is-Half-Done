" the reality mingles with the feelings of each other is that it can bring families together even when they â€™ re far apart , " lee says in a statement . " the story we are telling is all-purpose and can be easily understood by any other nation or community who can easily link the happy ending of a smile and tears of emotion to their daily human experience .
