a chinese tourist who tried to report a stolen wallet during a visit to germany signed an asylum application that got him stranded as a refugee for two weeks , the guardian reports . " he did n't speak any german or english , " says a red cross official . " he kept trying to talk to people to tell his story but no one could understand him . he kept asking to get his passport back , which is the opposite of what most refugees do . " according to the guardian , the man was fingerprinted and then taken to a shelter in duelmen , germany , on monday . he was taken to the hospital , where he is now being held without bail . he 's currently being held on $ 20,000 bail . he 's expected to face up to $ 20,000 in fines . the man 's lawyer says he 's " shocked " by the idea of a police station in the northern town of duelmen , which he says is " unfortunately an extremely bureaucratic country . especially during the refugee crisis i 've seen how much red tape we have , " he says . " it was an extraordinary moment for us all . he spent 12 days trapped in our bureaucratic jungle because we could n't communicate . "
