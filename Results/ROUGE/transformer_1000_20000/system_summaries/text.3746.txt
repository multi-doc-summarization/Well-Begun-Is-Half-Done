aretha franklin 's rendition of the " national anthem " was meant to be a tribute to aretha franklin at the detroit lions and minnesota vikings , but it was n't exactly a surprise . the queen of soul has a career six decades , and she 's won 20 grammy awards , reports usa today . " i 'm not going to be the best word to use to describe franklin 's performance , " she tweeted . " i 've never seen anything like this before . " she added that she 's " proud " of the national anthem , and that it was " dramatic " and that the " flag " would probably work better after franklin somehow managed to belt the anthem out for a full four minutes and 35 seconds after the anthem , reports the new york daily news . the vikings had been pushed back to church in the wake of the anthem controversy , and the anthem played a role in the lions ' national anthem protests . " we have a lot of people on this planet , " said franklin , who was granted the medal of freedom , per the washington post . " it was a great day for the vikings . "
