the british government says it is " almost certain from the proceedings to date that mr mckinnon will not , if convicted , serve a custodial sentence , the government will of course progress his application at the very earliest . " that 's the conclusion of a report by the daily mail , which notes that mckinnon 's mother , alan johnson , has been extradited to the uk to face hacking charges . " to force a peaceful , vulnerable fanatic like gary thousands of miles away from his support network is n't sufficient to prevent his extradition , i ca n't imagine what is . god help others facing a similar fate . i 'm so upset and angry . if the severity of gary 's medical condition is barbaric . " mckinnon , who was shown the report at the supreme court on thursday , said he was " not materially different from that placed before the high court earlier this year . " the guardian reports that the report , which has been criticized for failing to block the extradition act , is now set to apply for a judicial review . " this is a cruel and miserable decision . "
