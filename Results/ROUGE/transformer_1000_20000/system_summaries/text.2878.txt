scientists have found a correlation between two asian species and one in the everglades , and it 's a doozy : a new study finds that the burmese python , which has exploded in numbers to make it an even more formidable predator , is the result of the extinction . the study , published in the journal of sciences , found that the python 's mitochondrial dna passed down through the waterways of 1.5m-acre wilderness pythons , the christian science monitor reports . " when two species come together they have a unique set of traits and characteristics they use to increase their survival and their unique environments , " says study author margaret hunter of the university of rochester . " you bring these different traits together and sometimes the best of those traits will be selected in the offspring of a tangled family tree . " the study looked at 400 burmese pythons , which were found to be the largest in the world , reports the los angeles times . the researchers say they 've found evidence of a blended python in climbing tree frogs , but they have n't been able to figure out how much they could be . " the ones that have this signature would have to be female and breeding to pass it on to their offspring , " a researcher says . " it 's not the first time they 've ever seen before . "
