the wisconsin state department has granted a temporary restraining order against the state from enforcing a new law requiring doctors to perform abortions if they do n't have abortions , the milwaukee journal sentinel reports . gov . scott walker says the law is " reasonably directed to the preservation of health , " but it 's not clear whether the law will apply to women who perform abortions to have hospital-admitting privileges . " there will almost certainly be a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges of women , " he says . " the current system already handles the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications . " the state 's department of justice says it will stay in place pending a hearing next week , the ap reports . the law , which requires women to have an ultrasound before getting an abortion , would allow doctors to administer abortions to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice . the law would require a judge to order the law to reinstate the law . conley , who is expected to face a six-month penalty of up to 10 years in prison if convicted , says he will stay on the books .
