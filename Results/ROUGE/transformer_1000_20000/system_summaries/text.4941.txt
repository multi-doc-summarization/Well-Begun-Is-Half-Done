" we are not going to just stand by the end of the year , " patagonia says . " we have a lot to do with it . " the move comes after patagonia announced that it was phasing out bears ears , which is considered sacred and is home to an estimated 100,000 sites , reports npr , which notes that the national monuments authority on monday announced it will sue the interior secretary of state and the canyons of utah and utah , which are part of the " largest collection of monuments in the history of mankind , " per the times . patagonia , however , says it 's " very concerned " about the move . " we do n't know how much the bears are , " he says . " it 's a good thing to do . "
