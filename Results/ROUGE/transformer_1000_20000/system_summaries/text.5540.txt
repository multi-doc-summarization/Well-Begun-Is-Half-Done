idris elba is sick of talking about the ongoing speculation that he 's being lined up as the next james bond movie . " honestly , it 's a rumor that ’ s really starting to eat itself , " the 42-year-old star of luther and the wire tells the daily mail . " if there was ever any chance of me getting bond , it ’ s gone . " he adds that he is " probably a bit too greedy to play the part . " but elba himself is n't buying it . " i blame daniel , " he tells the new york times , adding that elba himself has " never happened , " adding that he has no regrets about the new book . " i do n't think that 's what i 've ever seen , but i think it 's going to happen to anyone . " he says he 's not sure how the book will be released , but he does n't think it will be a " particularly bad feeling , " but he says it will " creep " and " reeks of desperation . "
