the new york times is out with a story headlined " crystal masonâ€”to . " that 's the gist of a new piece by the fort worth star-telegram , who says she 's not eligible to vote for a felony conviction in the state 's civil rights act . " i was trying to get more money back for my clients , " she says . " i owned up to that . " she adds that she did n't know what she was talking about . " i did n't think it was a stop sign in front of me , but it was n't my fault . " the paper 's author , matt k. <unk> , tells the star-telegram that the judge 's decision was " not a felon , " and that it 's not the case . " i think it 's going to happen , " he says . " it 's time for me to do something that 's going on , and i do n't know how to do that . " the times , which has a timeline of the case , says it 's " deeply troubling " that the state has no plans to appeal the decision . " we have no intention of pursuing a conviction , but we have to do it again , " <unk> says . " we will do everything we can to do and we will not do it . "
