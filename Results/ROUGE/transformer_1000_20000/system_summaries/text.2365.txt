harvard professor karen l. king says he 's hoping that we can move past the issue of a forgery in the 1960s and '70s , but that 's not the case . the new york times reports that the fragment dating back to eighth- century bc was found to have been married to jesus as well as the vatican 's academic peers . " i 've never seen anything like this , " king tells the times . " it 's a very good thing to do . " king says the document was " probably part of a debate among early christians about the significance of this fragment for the history of christianity , for thinking about questions like , â€˜ why does jesus being married , or not , even matter ? why is it that people had such an incredible reaction to this ? ' " the times notes that it 's not clear whether the papyrus itself was applied in modern times , but the paper 's analysis of the papyrus contains a copy of the fragment , which contains a <unk> copy of a coptic papyrus fragment dating to the same period . it 's unclear if the fragment was actually married , but it would have been composed later than the gospels of the new testament , which is why the ink is so subjective that it can be accessed by the internet . the times reports the fragment is believed to be a forgery , but king says it 's possible that the ink could have offered evidence to prove it was a forgery . ( meanwhile , a papyrus fragment found to be worth $ 300,000 . )
