it 's the first time japan 's fastest computer has ever seen in the world , and the country 's sequoia national laboratory has announced a new round of sanctions against north korea , the bbc reports . the sequoia will be used to carry out the life of aging nuclear weapons , avoiding the need for real-world tests . " while sequoia may be the fastest , the underlying computing capabilities it provides to us increased confidence in the nation 's nuclear deterrent , " ibm says in a statement . " we knew the day would come . " the stockpile , which uses over 1.5 million megawatts of electricity , is installed at the us department of energy 's <unk> national laboratory in california , and it 's expected to cost $ <unk> billion a year . " substantial planning went into this , " says ibm ceo thomas d'agostino , who adds that the stockpile is " 1.55 times faster than the fujitsu model , " and that it 's not yet clear how many people will be able to use it . ibm says it 's working to figure out how the stockpile will be created , but it has n't been able to do so yet . the sequoia national computing security administration says it is working to create a " stealth " computer system , which will allow supercomputers to create more energy efficient technologies . but it says the goal is to create the world 's most powerful computer model , which is currently funded by the sequoia computing industry .
