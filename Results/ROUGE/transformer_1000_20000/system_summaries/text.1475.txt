the tennessee river is getting a lot of flak for its handling of the state 's drought . the state senate declared that it , not its neighbor to the north , was set at latitude 35Â° north when georgia 's first gave up the mississippi territory , reports the detroit free press . " the blue line on this map is a boundary dispute between two southern states took a turn for the wet , ajc.com , and <unk> , " wrote the resolution . " it wants that water . georgia 's claim is that the state experienced some level of drought ; it was last year the first time such a drought that registered as extreme . " the resolution passed a resolution calling for georgia to ban the state from moving the boundary to alabama , which last year saw a similarly bad drought . the resolution was overwhelmingly <unk> , but it hit 99 % , notes the new york times , and the state is n't eager to give up its water either . " we 're going to have to wait a long time to figure out what it 's going to happen , " says georgia 's attorney general . " we do n't have a problem with it . "
