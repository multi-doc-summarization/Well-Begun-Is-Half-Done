pope francis has suspended the press credentials of the vatican , and the vatican says it 's " mostly " due to human activity and the burning of fossil fuels , the ap reports . " i just wrote the introduction , " he said in a text to the vatican 's correspondent , per the new york times . he added that he had promised the vatican to keep quiet about the scoop , but that his editor , sandro magister , says the publication had been " incorrect . " magister says the leak is just a draft of the encyclical , an orthodox theologian , and an economist to discuss the contents of the document , which is published in the journal of la stampa reported by the ap . the vatican said the leak might have come from " conservatives " to the belief that the vatican has had a long and storied history , and that it 's not a scientific reality . but it 's also not the first time the pope has voiced his support for a radical change in behavior to save the planet for future generations and prevent the poor from suffering the worst effects of industry-induced in the papacy , which he says raises the possibility that it will be in their interest . the ap notes that the pope 's reform blog has been updated to reflect on the vatican bureaucracy , but the paper notes that it does n't appear to be the first pope for the pontiff .
