north korea 's third nuclear test on tuesday was an act of self-defense against north korea , the new york times reports . according to the ap , the chinese communist party looks upon the north 's willingness to keep north korea from splintering . according to reuters , the north has been toying with the idea that the north is " not even able to conduct military exercises with the chinese government . " the north says it has " no choice " to abandon their ally , but the us has n't responded to the report . " we have no idea how bad its behavior , analysts here say , " says a north korean official . " it 's time to get rid of north korea . " north korea has threatened to nuke the north , but it says it will " continue to defend its nuclear weapons . " the times reports it 's unclear how much latitude on the korean peninsula will be on the table , though the times sees it as a potential sign that the us will be ready to respond to threats against the north . the times notes that the test could be applied to north korea for the first time since it was launched in 2006 , but analysts say it could take weeks to hammer out a new strategy . " china really holds the key to what the actions will be different this time , " one analyst tells the times .
