america 's strength does n't come from donald trump , but it 's a doozy of a speech at philadelphia 's democratic national convention . " i alone can fix it. " he said , referring to trump as the first female presidential nominee of a major party . " is n't he forgetting troops on the front lines ? doctors and nurses who care for us ? teachers who possibilities in every problem ? mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe . he 's forgetting every last one of us . americans do n't say . " he added that he 's " glad to hear that , " reports politico , which notes that the speech was " not so dark and ominous a speech : a warning against the danger posed to america by a trump presidency . " none of us can raise a family , build a business , or lift a country totally alone . " the washington post notes that while clinton did n't skip over the speech , she did admit that he had n't paid for it , and that he did n't think he had any inkling of what he was talking about . " it â€™ s a great idea , " she said , adding that " the only generation of americans has come together to make our country freer , fairer , and stronger . "
