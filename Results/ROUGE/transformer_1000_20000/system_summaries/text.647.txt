michelle obama 's tuesday night speech at the democratic national convention was " a lot more energetic than anyone expected it to be , " writes david gergen in the washington post . " so far it really feels like there 's a lot raw enthusiasm in this room than in tampa. . " that 's what david gergen at politico is saying : " there is more energy in strickland 's speech than there was in the entire three days of the gop fest. , " he writes . " remember when chris christie had to beg republican delegates to stand up ? " " the dnc is very low energy , not the vibrant , youth allure of 2008 , " and that 's how the rnc has been trying to figure out how much it 's going on . " in the wake of the newtown massacre , the obama family has called for a boycott of the democratic convention , but it 's not clear how much the speech will be . " i â€™ m not going to be a hot convention , " says one gop strategist . " this is exactly the convention people in this country . "
