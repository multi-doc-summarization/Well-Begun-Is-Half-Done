" i personally wish that he had never run , i told him that , because i actually think this is something that is gon na be detrimental to his mental health too , because he wants to be liked , he 's now on this anti-hollywood kick . he lives for it . he loves people in hollywood . he only wants hobnob with them . all of this hatred and stuff towards him . it 's not good . there 's a reason every president who leaves the office has grey hair . " stern , on the other hand , says he 's " shocked when he decided to run for president , and even more shocked that sort of , people took it seriously . " " i remember saying to him when he announced his presidency , i remember him being for hillary clinton , " he says . " he wants people to cheer for him . " stern 's response : " he loves hollywood . first of all , he loves the press . " stern on his radio show : " i think it started out as like a kinda cool , fun thing to do in order to get a couple more bucks out of nbc for the apprentice , i actually do believe that , " stern said . " i do n't think it 's going to be a healthy experience . and by the way , he â€™ ll find it hard for him . "
