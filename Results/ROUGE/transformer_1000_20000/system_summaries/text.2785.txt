the washington state 's secession term is getting a lot more attention : the state 's legislature has voted to split the state into two separate entities , reports the new york times . the move comes after gov . martin o'malley declared that the state is " controlled and dominated by three jurisdictions : " they will assault our rights and our wallets , " he said . " we have not given consent to the oppressive laws and regulations imposed . consent of the governed means we can count on from annapolis on the five western counties of maryland . " the only two things we can do is add to the list : frederick , prince george 's county , and baltimore city . the only other state to do so is that weld county and washington into a new state called western maryland or west virginia . but the state does n't think it 's a hoax , and it 's not clear whether it will be a secession kit . the state also has a different view of the state , notes the times , which rounds up some of the reasons behind the move .
