donald trump is taking a lot of flak for his handling of abortion , and now he 's taking flak for what he sees as a " recurring nightmare . " " i don ’ t think that ’ s an appropriate response , " he tells the washington post . " it ’ s a difficult enough ” for trump , he says , adding that " of course we shouldn ’ t be talking about punishing women ; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the country . " the new york times , meanwhile , reports that trump has been trying to persuade supporters not to support the nominee . " i ’ ve evolved to be a victim in this case , as is the life in her womb , " cruz says . " i will say anything just to get attention , but i think i ’ ll say this , that as a result , i ’ m pro-life , and i was originally pro-choice . " the hill reports that while trump has called for a boycott of the world cup , it 's not clear whether the gop will be able to vote for it , but politico points out that the gop may be softening its stance on immigration , not the women who receive them . " the chaos felt something like a nightmare , " says one gop operative , noting that " the woman is a very good person . "
