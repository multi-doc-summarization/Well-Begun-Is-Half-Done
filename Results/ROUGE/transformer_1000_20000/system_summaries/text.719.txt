the baltic sea is getting a lot of flak over the past few centuries , and it 's a good one . the german maritime expert says that while the russian submarine is not that old , it 's " dangerous . " that 's the conclusion of a study published wednesday in scientific reports , published in the journal of sciences , that the <unk> shipwreck off the swedish coast is the culmination of what the guardian calls " an old wooden shipwreck in the north sea . " in a press release , thomas dehling explains that the disks used to be used to create a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . the disks , which were found to have been stored in the <unk> , were found in a <unk> crater that had been found in swedish waters . " we have quite a lot , roughly 1,000 objects that are potentially dangerous to shipping , depending on the importance of the object and the sea lane , maybe once a year or only once every 25 years . that 's why we do n't disseminate our information on the entire baltic sea , but there 's a map on your website ? yes , but it 's not clear how many square miles will be constructed , reports the guardian , which notes that it 's the first time the russian has been able to figure out how to make it commercially viable for the ediacarans to find a way to keep it in place . " if you 're going to find it , you 'll find an object when you use that map because it 's going to have to be very experienced to dive there , " dehling says
