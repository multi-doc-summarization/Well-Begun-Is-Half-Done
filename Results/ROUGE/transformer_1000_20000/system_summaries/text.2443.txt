" her ability and word usage ( coming from me , who has written many best sellers ) , is not at a very high level . more importantly , her facts are wrong ! as far as the two notices placed in newspapers , many things could have happened , but some feel the grandparents put an ad in order to show that he was a citizen of the us with all of the benefits thereto . " " equally of importance , there are no records in hawaii that a barack hussein obama was born in kenya and she was there to watch the birth , " she writes . " but you can tell obama did the second book himself because it read like it was written by somebody of average intelligence with a high school birth is very easy to obtain . " she adds , " i do n't know what they â€™ re finding , " but that does n't mean she 's a " birth certificate , " and that she 's " very derogatory " and " meant in a derogatory way . " she also notes that he 's been " studying it , and they can not believe it . "
