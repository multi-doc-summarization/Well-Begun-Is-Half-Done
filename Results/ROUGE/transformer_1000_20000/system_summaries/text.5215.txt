brandy springer , a mother of four mixed race children , was stunned when she moved to the area from florida and learned her 12-year-old daughter could n't run for class reporter because she was n't the right race . " it is the belief of the current administration that these procedures were implemented to help ensure minority representation and involvement in the student body , " springer says in a statement , per the washington post . " it 's our hope and desire that these practices and procedures are no longer needed . " the naacp called for a justice department investigation into the jim crow era , which has been in place for 30 years , reports the los angeles times . the school 's superintendent says diversity is no longer a black and white issue , but " we want to teach our children to our families , " he says , adding that " we have a lot of respect for our children . " but the group says it does n't think the school should be allowed to run for president and whites could hold other positions , including the fact that black students are n't allowed to be classified as racist . " i do n't think it 's a racist , racist , or black man only , but i 'm not going to do this : " the rules sparked an outcry on blogs and other websites after springer contacted an advocacy group for mixed-race families . " we 've got a lot more feedback on this issue , " says the district 's superintendent . " we do n't have a problem with racial equality . "
