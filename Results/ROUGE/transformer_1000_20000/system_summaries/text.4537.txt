two of the world 's largest atm makers have warned that the secret service is targeting one of its atm models , the los angeles times reports . according to the krebs on security , the hackers breached the atm attacks last year , and the number of users on a computer advisory has now been updated . " this should be treated by all deployers as a call to action to take appropriate steps to protect their atms against these forms of attack , " says the alert . the hackers say they had used an industrial keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code , but they did n't identify any victims or say how much money had been lost . " the attacks were reported earlier this year , but it was still a concern for the entire atm industry , " a russian cyber security firm said in a friday alert . the company said it had sent out the alerts to clients about the attacks . it 's unclear how much cash has been stolen because victims and police often do n't disclose details about their atms . but the company says it does n't have a copy of the report .
