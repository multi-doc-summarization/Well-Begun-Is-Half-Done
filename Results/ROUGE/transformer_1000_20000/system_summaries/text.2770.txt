" the oconee county sheriff 's office says the storm was " extremely rare , " but it 's not clear whether the ban was physically stopping someone from purchasing valentine 's items . " i may have written the proclamation but i 've got to give these guys a chance , " berry says . " yes , valentine ’ s day . " the sheriff says berry , a former deputy sheriff , has taken to facebook to announce his plans to do so after he noticed how many stores were closed after the storm . weems , who says he 's used to berry 's day items , has n't commented on his own decree . he says the sheriff will not be allowed to catch a pass until tuesday so they can play a free pass .
