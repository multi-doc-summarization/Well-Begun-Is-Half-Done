a new study in plos one finds that great apes can use an understanding of false beliefs to help others , reports afp . researchers looked at great apes and found that the apes were more likely to have the capacity to understand when a person is wrong in their beliefs . " this person would place an object on one of two boxes , while a great ape looked on , " says lead researcher david buttelmann . " for other parts , the apes had a lot more relaxed than their peers . " the study looked at 34 great apes , and found the subjects were more often separated from their <unk> counterparts . the subjects did n't seem to have a correlation between the apes and the apes , but they did n't understand how much they were able to unlock the mysteries of the apes . in the study , researchers found that subjects who had a false belief in the location of the box and put it into another box . they also found that those who knew the object to be , not realizing it had been moved . the findings were based on a survey of great apes that found the apes did n't have the ability to socialize with humans . but the researchers did note that the subjects had a slight advantage in the apes ' behavior , and that they had a tendency to open the first box , which was known as the false-belief portion of the study . the findings are based on the fact that the person stayed in the room and could see when the object was moved . ( another fascinating recent study found that orangutans may be more nutritious . )
