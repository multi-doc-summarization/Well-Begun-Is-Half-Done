new zealand spy agency edward snowden says it 's " not a revolution in the way new zealand operates . " that 's the conclusion that the country 's prime minister , edward snowden , is seen on the computer screen of the council of europe , the intercept reports . " the gcsb , whose operations he is responsible for , is directly involved in the untargeted , bulk and algorithmic analysis of private communications sent via internet , and phone networks. , " the former nsa analyst says in a statement . " the prime minister 's claim to the public , that ‘ there is no and there never has been any mass surveillance ’ , is false , " snowden says . the new york times , meanwhile , reports that the nsa has n't commented on the nsa 's purported surveillance capabilities , but it 's not clear whether the nsa will be able to do anything about the surveillance , which could be used by the nsa to spy on new zealand 's nuclear surveillance programs . the nsa is trying to figure out how to use the program , but the times notes that new zealand has been working on a new law that would allow it to be used for the purposes of the surveillance programs . the nsa , which has n't been able to rein in the surveillance program , says it does n't have the authority to do so , and it has n't done so yet . " i think it 's time to do something about it , but i do n't know what it 's going to do , " he says .
