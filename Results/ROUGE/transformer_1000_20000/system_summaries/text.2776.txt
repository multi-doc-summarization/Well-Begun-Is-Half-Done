a new breed of olive tree fly that could stop their natural counterparts in spain , according to new research out of the university of spain . the researchers say they 've found a correlation between olive trees and a gene that causes female offspring to die in the larval stage . the study , published in mashable , found that the flies are implanted with the gene , and that the insects could intermingle and cause other mosquitoes to reproduce . " this is not the first time we 've ever seen , " says lead researcher luke parry . " we 've got a lot of pesticides that we 've seen in the past . " the researchers , who studied the effects of genetic science and technology in europe , say the findings are " much more practical and safe than , say , " the guardian reports . " the mosquito lives and breeds very close to humans , " parry says . " it â€™ s not going to happen . " the study also found that mosquitoes in the city of mandacaru , ind. , had a few more bugs to breed . " i do n't want those chemicals near where they live , " he says . " i think they 're going to get rid of what 's going on . "
