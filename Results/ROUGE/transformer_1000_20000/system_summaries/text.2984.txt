the salt lake city police department is investigating the death of a nurse who refused to take blood from an unconscious person , the ap reports . alex wubbels , 26 , was arrested friday after explaining that she could n't draw a blood sample . " on the face of the evidence , there is concern that is raised about this officer 's conduct , " gill said in a friday interview . " but the whole point of an investigation is to gather the information about what they saw on police body camera footage of the arrest , which took place july 26 , and said changes to police blood draw policies and officer training had been made . " i am sad at the rift this has caused between law enforcement and the nurses we work so closely with , " says gill , who was placed on administrative leave friday , per the washington post . the mayor said thursday was the first time she had seen the body camera in full . payne 's attorney , karra porter , tells the post that the hospital nurse , who is in critical condition after the crash , told the paper that the video was the result of a " pattern of incidents " and that it would be appropriate to conduct an investigation in the name of transparency and institutional racism . " we do n't know what happened , but we do know that it 's going to happen . "
