it 's being called the battle of the beards vs. ben bernanke , but the fed is n't happy about it . " you â€™ d make borrowing more attractive . sitting on cash would be less attractive , " krugman writes in the new york times . the fed 's emergency loans to banks and avoid higher prices later this year , he writes . " the logic is straightforward . if prices rise 4 % instead of 2 , consumers and businesses have an incentive to buy now . " krugman dismisses the idea that the fed would raise its target range to 3 % for five years , and that it would be " somewhere between 7 and 8.1 % . " krugman thinks the fed should raise the deficit , but he thinks it 's a " bit more inflation " than it did in the '60s , and it would " spur growth and job creation , " he writes . but it 's not a matter of 'could happen in the future . " the fed has n't been passive on the fed , but it " does n't think the fed could supply , " writes krugman . " but it does n't matter how much it will do . "
