peter brinkley says he 's " deeply sorry for my part in causing any unnecessary pain , " but that 's not the case . in a letter obtained by the new york post , brinkley says she 's sorry for bad-mouthing the model by saying that " it was the black cloud of christie brinkley 's hate . " " i have privately apologized to her , but given the public nature of their divorce and custody battle , i feel a public apology is also appropriate and deserved , " she writes . " i truly feel it ’ s simply the right thing to do . i ’ ll be here for you . " shaw , who is also co-director of the philandering national enquirer , says he has no plans to file any charges against cook , who has been accused of sexual assault and sexually abusing a child . " what i say here is by my own volition , " he says . " i ’ ve talked recently and i wish you the courage to do what i did by taking a public stand ; she was only trying to protect my children . " he adds that the apology was " also appropriate , " and that he " fell under peter 's spell , but now that the reality of who he 's been cheating on you , i 've never seen anything like that . "
