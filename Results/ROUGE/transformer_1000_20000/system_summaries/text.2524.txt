a federal judge on friday ordered the trump administration to return the white house press credentials of cnn reporter jim acosta , an appointee of president trump , announced his decision following a hearing in washington . the judge said acosta 's credentials would be returned immediately and reactivated to allow him access to white house complex for press briefings and other events , the ap reports . cnn asked for a temporary restraining order over his credentials , but cnn had asked the judge to revoke acosta 's hard pass . " the judge also found that acosta suffered " irreparable harm , " dismissing the government 's argument that cnn could just send other reporters to cover the bench . " the white district revoked acosta , saying that the government could not say who initially decided to revoke the first amendment . the judge told acosta that the first argument was continuing . " i am not going to proceed , " he said . " we will not allow this to happen . " he added that the judge 's decision was " not sufficient to satisfy due process . " a judge is expected to announce friday whether he will order the trump white house to return to the us .
