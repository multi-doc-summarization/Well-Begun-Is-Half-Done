north korea 's state-controlled news agency is backtracking on its six-month-old pricing strategy today , and it looks like it 's going to be a big surprise for north korea . the new york times reports that kim jong un 's supreme leader , kim jong-il , is expected to announce his resignation today . " we are not going to vote for the north , " he said in a statement . " we will not allow the north to do anything about it . " meanwhile , the washington post reports that the north has been trying to woo voters in the wake of the north 's 24.9 million voter turnout , with only those absent from the country 's central government . the ap notes that the vote is " not a dangerous act of treason , " and notes that there 's no indication that north korea will be able to govern responsibly in the first place . the ap reports that it 's not clear how many votes will be counted , but it 's still unclear whether it will be enough votes in the senate . meanwhile , a north korean central news poll finds that kim 's first vote in the country has been seen as the likeliest candidates to win the presidency , and that 's not likely to happen anytime soon . " voters do not have much choice . they are presented with a single candidate in the district where they live , " an official says .
