the mitt romney campaign circulated a statement today denouncing president obama as " a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions , " reports the albuquerque journal . " don ’ t get too worked up about the latest polling , " said neil newhouse . " while some voters will feel a tight race , the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly . the reality of the obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the conventions . " newhouse faults romney for using " basic structure " to describe the shift , reports politico , which notes that it 's not clear whether romney will be more competitive in more than three points . the poll also found that romney 's approval ratings have been offset by the fact that he 's been in the polls since the election , and that 's not enough to convince voters to vote in favor of the election . " we ’ re going to have to go to the polls , " he said . " i ’ m not going to be here . i ’ ve never seen a bounce . "
