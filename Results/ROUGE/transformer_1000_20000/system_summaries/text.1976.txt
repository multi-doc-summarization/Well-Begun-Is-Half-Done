ken mehlman is gay . in a new interview with the atlantic , matt yglesias writes that mehlman " is gay . lots of people thought so , but nobody knew for sure until mehlman began telling friends and family in recent months , " he writes . " it ’ s something that runs counter to the stereotype , most of the conservatives i know are largely to completely indifferent to a person ’ s sexual orientation . " he ticks back on that theme : " this is a big deal . he is , after all , the most powerful republican ever to identify himself as gay . that ’ s important , because if you look at polls over the last 30 or 40 years , you ’ ve never seen anything like this before . " ambinder thinks the problem is that it 's involuntary , " but it 's not a matter of time , but it does n't matter how much of it is to be . " ambinder does n't think the rnc intentionally mischaracterized the " psychosis " of racial bias in the discourse about gays and lesbians . " the problem , he writes , is that mehlman has given a full 700 % rating on rotten tomatoes .
