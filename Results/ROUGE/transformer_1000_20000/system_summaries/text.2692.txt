brandon jenkins is suing the community college of baltimore county , alleging that he was not accepted into a program based on his religious views , the baltimore sun reports . " what is the most important thing to you ? " he says . " i understand that religion is a major part of your life and that was evident in your recommendation , however , this field is not the place for religion . " jenkins , who says he was rejected because of religious objections to the program , filed a lawsuit last week accusing the aclj of " withholding evidence " from the radiation program . the aclj says it 's asking for a " fair amount of time " to be admitted into the program . " the problem is that you have a guy who is qualified in all areas , and in the rejection letter , they single out his faith as a reason for his rejection . that 's just unlawful , " dougherty says . " we have many patients who come to us for treatment from many different religions and some who believe in nothing at all . if you interview in the future , you may want to leave your thoughts and beliefs out of the process . " jenkins says he wants the aclj to keep the interview quiet , but that does n't mean the aclj wo n't be able to do so . he says he does n't have the authority to do the right thing , but he does say that the aclj does n't do so , and that it 's not clear whether the aclj will do so .
