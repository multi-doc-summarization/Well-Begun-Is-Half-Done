" we have a saying in china : the cadres produce the data , and data produces the cadres , " says the head of the national bureau of statistics . " i wouldn ’ t be surprised if the gdp numbers this year are offset . " china 's top economist , andrew batson , says the economy is " giving us quite good credit for the economy . " but the times notes that it 's not the first time china 's economy is struggling to cope with the crisis . " it 's going to have that reporting system in place , " he says , noting that the economy 's growth rate is up to 8.5 % , but that 's not enough to make it harder for the government to figure out how to handle the growth of the economy . " it ’ s a matter of time , and that number doesn ’ t always line up with the other numbers , ” he says . " these same officials have been promoted on their success in making their numbers . "
