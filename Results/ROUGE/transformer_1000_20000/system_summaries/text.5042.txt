a protein called cardiotrophin 1 , also known as ct-1 , can trick heart into repairing the heart of growing up in a healthy way , according to a new study . researchers from the ottawa hospital and the university of ottawa in canada say they 've found that the protein , called cardiotrophin , is a combination of heart failure , the cbc reports . the study , published in the cell research journal , says that while the protein promotes blood flow , the heart can not pump enough blood . " this happens in a dysfunctional way , and it doesn ’ t actually help the heart pump , " lead researcher dr. lynn megeney tells the cbc . " it ’ s reversible . " the researchers say the protein adheres to stabilizing the heart , but they warn that it can reduce the risk of developing heart disease , the guardian reports . " we ’ re not going to have to do something about it , " the lead researcher says . " we don ’ t know what it is . " researchers say that while they do n't have a heart attack , they have n't yet figured out how much it is , and they say it 's possible to reduce heart failure and reduce the heart 's risk of heart disease . " it 's not the first time we 've seen it in the past five years , " one researcher says . " it is time to get people to work . "
