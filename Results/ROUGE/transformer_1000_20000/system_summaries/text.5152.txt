a fish farm in san juan islands rumbled to the waters of the atlantic salmon island on saturday , killing the fish and wildlife conservation group , the ap reports . according to the washington post , the eclipse was a " structural failure " and " exceptionally high tides and currents coinciding with this week 's solar eclipse . " this is the beginning of the spectrum , " says a marine ecologist at the university of bellingham bay . " it 's a very big day for the fish . " the fish program assistant director of the wild fish conservancy tells the post that the island 's population is about 10 pounds higher than usual , and that 's a fraction of the population 's population . " we have no idea how many escaped from the floating pen , " he says . " we are going to get to the bottom of the water . " the atlantic reports that the tide is expected to rise by the end of the year , and it 's unclear how much of the farmed atlantic salmon will be . " it is not the first time the fish have been going extinct , " a researcher says .
