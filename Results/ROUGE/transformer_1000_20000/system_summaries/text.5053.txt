thad mccotter is n't exactly a fan of the detroit news anymore , but he 's not the only one making headlines . the detroit free press reports that he 's pitching while in elected office , and he 's got a lot of flak for his handling of the show . " most of my writing is done in my garage â€¦ where i can smoke , " he said in a tv interview . " i 'm thai . " he added that he did n't write the script on the taxpayers ' time , but that was n't his only problem . the show , which has a michigan license plate reading , " made on motown . " but it 's not all bad news for the audience : it 's a " cathartic " bumper sticker , he added , per the news sentinel , which notes that the show is " cathartic . " it 's " fizzled " for the white house , notes politico , and the new york times notes that mccotter will be the first republican congressman to win the seat . he 'll be the only republican to win a seat in the chamber , and will be replaced by a former staffer who offered it as evidence of what the ap calls " the motown show cast with characters bearing the nicknames of his congressional staffers , his brother and a drunk , perverted " black santa .
