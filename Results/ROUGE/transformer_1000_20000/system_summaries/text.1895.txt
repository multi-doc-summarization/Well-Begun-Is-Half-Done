" i did not collude , nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded , with any foreign government , " kushner says in a statement , per nbc news . " i had no improper contacts . i have not relied on russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector . " kushner , who has been in the white house since 2010 , says he was unaware of russia 's meddling in the 2016 election , but he 's not the only one to do so . " i 've tried to be fully transparent , " he says . " hopefully , this puts these matters to rest.ï¿½ ? but a close read of the letter suggests that it does not , in fact , put these matters together to rest . " he adds that while he does n't know what he 's talking about , he 's going to say that he 's a big supporter of the trump campaign . " i 'm not sure what i 'm talking about this , but i do n't think that 's what i 've done . " he tells the new york times that he has no plans to file a civil lawsuit against kushner , and that his lawyers are n't commenting on the matter . " it 's just a matter of time , " says one of the lawyers who filed the statement . " we 've got a lot of bad publicity . "
