lonnie david franklin , a garbage truck driver who survived a 1988 attack , was found guilty today of murdering nine women and one girl over a span of three decades , the los angeles times reports . franklin 's sister , princess berthomieux , says she was " grateful for the sweet little girl who had her whole life in front of her , " but that 's not the case . " he does n't value life , " she says . " i do n't care . " franklin , who has been cautioned by the judge for a long time , says he has no regrets about the killings . " the trial in franklin 's case is hardly over , " he says . " it 's the first time i 've ever had a conviction , and i 've never seen anything like that . " but the judge 's decision to dismiss the case was " not surprised " by the fact that it was franklin 's " grim sleeper " because of a 13-year gap in the us army in the 1970s . " it was n't a matter of time , " says a prosecutor . " it would have been impossible to convict the victims . "
