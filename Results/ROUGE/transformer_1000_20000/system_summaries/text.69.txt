a new study suggests that elephants are more sophisticated than previously believed to be farmers , but researchers say they 've figured out why . the study , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , found that elephants can differentiate between different languages and move away from those considered a " vulnerable species , " reports nature . the researchers , who studied the university of sussex in kenya , studied the frequency of human voices in 47 family groups , and found that the elephants were more likely to survive in the wild . " the ability to distinguish between maasai and kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that they can discriminate against elephants , " the lead researcher says in a press release . " it is very sophisticated what the elephants are doing , " he adds . " they do n't know how much they would respond . " the researchers say the findings could be applied to humans , but they warn that they may not have a danger to elephants . " we do n't have a lot of animals , " says a researcher . " but we have a tendency to do whatever it takes . " the study 's lead author , dr. seuss , says the findings are based on a " pattern of behavior , " and that the findings suggest elephants are " smarter , " but that 's not the case . " if you 're going to get a little bit more attention , it 's a matter of time . "
