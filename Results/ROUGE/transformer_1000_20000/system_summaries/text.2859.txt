taylor swift is taking a lot of flak for her portrayal of taylor swift , and now she 's getting a cat on his head . " i can have issues with it , " she tells the new york daily news . " i think that 's interesting . ' " she adds that " i 've never seen a guy walking down the street with a cat . " she says the other half was going " 'we should be able to fake from the bangles to billy joel , the boldest , genre-crossing jams , and <unk> . " " i do n't want to have a camera pointed at you . sometimes it would be nice if someone just said , 'hey , i think it 's really cool that you have that cat on your head . ' " but she 's not alone . " i 'm not going to be ungrateful , because i chose this , " swift says in a statement , per the hollywood reporter . " my first reaction was , you take a picture ? " she added , " i am so sorry , i am not a fan of samuels . " she also notes that she 's been " disappointed " by the video , which she says has been shared more than 100 times since the video was posted online , and that 's not the case . " it 's the other day i 've ever seen , and i 've been so ecstatic about it now , but it does n't matter how much it 's going to do . "
