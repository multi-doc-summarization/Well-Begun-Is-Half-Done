john mccain 's visit to the united nations regarding senator bashar al-assad 's government of iraq and syria has been dashed by the syrian secret service agency , the new york times reports . " it is a sad but unsurprising truth that the assad regime is less concerned with its massacre of more than 200,000 men , women and children than it is my visit with those brave syrians fighting for their freedom and dignity , " mccain said in a statement , per reuters . " the fact that the international community has done virtually nothing to bring down this terrible regime despite its atrocities is a stain on our collective moral conscience. ‚Äù the syrian complaint was made on monday by the un security council in a letter to take " the necessary measures against their nationals who enter syrian territory illegally . " the syrian regime is " less concerned " with the massacre of nearly 200,000 men in 2014 . mccain , who fired back at damascus and accused mccain of creating the islamic state , said he would " put him on a sanctions list as soon as possible as possible .
