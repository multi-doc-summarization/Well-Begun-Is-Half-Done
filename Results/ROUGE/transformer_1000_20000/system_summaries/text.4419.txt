the cleveland flu season is getting a lot more attention than the flu season , according to a gofundme campaign set up by the centers for disease control and prevention . " our sweet emily grace passed away today on jan. 19 , " the family of 6-year-old emily muth tells the pittsburgh post-gazette . " every year in the us , somewhere between 100 to 300 pediatric deaths form the flu are reported . " the cdc will report new data on pediatric deaths on jan. 26 . the number of people who died from flu in past years were not vaccinated , the cdc says . " we do n't know what 's going to happen with the rest of the season . we probably have n't peaked yet , " says dr. john williams of the children 's hospital of pittsburgh medical center . the vaccine , which is made from two proteins culled from the surface of killed virus particles in the flu , is expected to go up as soon as may , reports the cleveland plain dealer . the flu is n't a perfect match for the flu . " it 's likely an underestimate , " williams says . but if the vaccine does n't prevent you from getting sick , " it would be impossible to get the specific brand or presentation they want and may need to select something else . " if you 're vaccinated at the end of october , you 're going to have a lot of vaccine , " he says , per nbc news . " you can do everything you can . "
