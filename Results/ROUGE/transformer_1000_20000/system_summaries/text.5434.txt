scientists say they 've figured out how much water did mars actually have when it was young and how did it lose that water , reports the christian science monitor . in a study published thursday in science , researchers found that the body of water spread over a fifth of the planet 's surface , or more than a mile deep in the arctic , reports phys.org . " a major question has been been how much ice in the polar regions , " says lead researcher michael mumma . " it ’ s very large physics that we ’ re going to have a foothold , and we ’ ve never seen anything like this . " the scientists say the water is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 billion years ago , and the researchers say they have found that hydrogen atoms in the martian air could be used to predict the formation of the martian atmosphere , reports nature . they say the planet would have been a " more erratic presence on mars than any other computer-generated sun . " geronimo says he believes the water 's ability to make it easier for oceans to breathe , but he says it 's not clear whether it 's the first time the planet has ever seen .
