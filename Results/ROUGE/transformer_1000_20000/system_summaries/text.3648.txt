the smithsonian 's national zoo in washington says two rare tiger cubs have been glued to the tiger cub 's first birthday in april . " it was a pretty powerful scene to watch , " kristen clark tells the smithsonian . " there 's something really happening. . " the tiger , which was described as the first sumatran tigers in the wild , was just over 100 days ago , when it hit with an audible smack in the middle of the tiger 's tail . " we knew at that point , " saffoe says , per the washington post . " we were sitting there watching , and we both kind of looked at each other as if they could catch the birth live . " the zoo 's director says sumatran tigers are listed as critically endangered . " how many people on the planet have seen this kind of thing happen before , " he says . " you count yourself lucky to be a part of it. ‚Äù the zoo says it 's not the first time the cubs were born in north america , but it 's still unclear if the tiger was alive , and the cubs are expected to survive . the zoo says <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
