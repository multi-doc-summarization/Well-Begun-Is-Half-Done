a virgin islands couple will be trading the caribbean breezes of st. john for the rigors of maine 's four seasons after winning a " win inn " essay contest . prince and rose adams , 45 and originally from new york city , entered the contest organized by sage . the retiring owner of the center lovell inn had won the restaurant and hostelry in a similar writing contest 22 years ago . the boston globe reports ( bit.ly/1iquhlx were notified last week that they had been picked by a local panel of judges . they 're closing their restaurant in st. john and expect to be open for business in center by july 2019 . " in short , janice was advertising a contest for ‘ dreamers ’ who would never have the chance to own an inn and restaurant , and then handed the prize to just such a business , " says sage prass , who founded the group . " one of the many allegations against janice and the contest she sponsored is that the group has organized as the center fair practices commission and complained that sage stated that no advantage would be granted to restaurant owners enough through the same way she had an actual chance of winning , " per the ap . maine state police said their investigation is narrowly tailored to determine whether the contest violated state law games of skill . under the law , which is an older statute primarily written to cover carnival games , operators of such games are prohibited from partially controlling the outcome .
