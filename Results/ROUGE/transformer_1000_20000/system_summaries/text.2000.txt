a new study out of the university of virginia finds that the neanderthal dna is doing for you . researchers found that the dna of a neanderthal dna found in the genomes of a man who lived in the czech republic , reports the guardian . " our main finding is that neanderthal dna does influence clinical traits in modern humans : we discovered between neanderthal dna and a wide range of traits , including immunological , neurological , and reproductive diseases , " says the study 's lead author , per the new york times . the study found that dna analysis was unreliable , but the researchers say the findings suggest that the link between modern humans and neanderthals is " incredibly complex , " reports the washington post . the findings are based on data from the genome analysis of more than 100 neanderthal dna traits . the researchers also found that those who had been recruited to identify more than 10,000 neanderthal dna fragments found in their brains were more likely to blame for our allergies . " the findings were based on the evidence of a link between arthritis and ultraviolet radiation , " a researcher says in a press release . " it 's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different perspective . " the researchers , however , say that the findings could shed light on why the dna was found to be unreliable , the guardian reports . the researchers say <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
