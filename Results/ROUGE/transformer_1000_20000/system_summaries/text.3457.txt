colin kaepernick 's protest of the national anthem protests continues , and the seattle seahawks ' new leader is unimpressed : " i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that 's what the world needs to see , " he tells the san francisco chronicle . " it 's going to be a team thing . that 's more heartening to me than anything is the veterans that have reached out and said that â€™ s what they sacrificed their lives for , is to give people back home under the flag , under this country , the opportunity to see people coming together versus sit for what they decide to do . " lane , who has been in contact with kaepernick over the past few years , says he has heard from veterans who have supported a series of tweets he posted about the protest . " we have the freedom to do whatever we want here , " lane says . " whatever i decide , i do n't know if i was going to sit on the sidelines of the protest . " he adds that he does n't think the seahawks will be able to do so , but that does n't mean he wo n't do it again . " if you do n't have a chance to do that , you 're going to get into too much trouble . we 're big kids , " baldwin says , adding that " you have a lot of people . "
