a zookeeper in tokyo has been found safe and sound two weeks after she escaped from a japanese zoo in august , the guardian reports . according to shibukawa , the 35-year-old female tortoise named abuh and made a break from the steamed animal park in nearby shrubbery prefecture . " we were so relieved that she came back safely as she is so popular among children , " says a zoo rep . " she might have climbed a mountain , making a big detour. . " the zoo had been looking for the escaped abu and alerted authorities , who say the tortoise offered a $ 4,500 reward for her safe return . " i was relieved that abu was discovered safely , " she says , per the guardian . but the zoo did n't know how much the tortoise was , and it was n't until recently , when it was found in a forest about 50 miles south of the park , where the tortoises had been allowed to walk freely around the zoo during opening hours . the tortoise is described as a " gentle " zookeeper , which is believed to be the largest tortoise species in the world . the tortoise 's family is n't commenting on the incident , but it 's not clear how many tortoises might be able to walk through a full speed of 1 , or whether she could n't find the tortoises , who are n't expected to survive . ( another recent find : a man 's nail-biting habit ended up costing $ 2.8 million . )
