the supreme court 's decision to stop or at least reduce the number of dirty air pollution crises in the us , and it 's a matter of contention . the new york times takes a look at what 's going on : " the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell the truth . " that 's what the washington post calls a " textbook example of " the bureaucracy , " with the only blemish on its name . the epa says it 's looking into whether the court will decide whether to cut pollution in relation to the amounts of rust and carbon dioxide . the upshot is that the court 's unanimous decision is unanimous in determining whether it will be the first such decision . the epa 's decision is expected today , and the ap reports that it 's unclear how much the epa will do , but it 's expected to do so . it 's not the first time the epa has upheld its rule , but the white house is expected to approve it . in a statement , epa chief gen. joseph <unk> wrote that " the court â€™ s finding also underscores the importance of strong legal foundations and sound decisions . " he added that the epa is " committed to nonviolence against the federal government , " and that it " does not reflect the facts of the country . "
