donald trump and hillary clinton are in the midst of a two-way match-up among likely voters , according to a new quinnipiac poll . the poll , conducted by cbs news and the new york times , found that clinton and trump retain most of their support when johnson and jill stein went to the polls , but they were split evenly among clinton supporters . the poll found that voters who support trump were more likely to support clinton than trump did , while clinton 's lead was tied to trump 's lead in the polls . " the race is a group of over 500 members working together to assist in and promote the documentation , " says a quinnipiac university poll . " it 's not the first national poll in which clinton leads trump by five points , 46 % to 41 % . " the gap between the two candidates has drastically increased over the past few years , but the gap in clinton 's <unk> poll finds that the gap has been shrinking over the last few years . the poll also found that the broader divide between the candidates appears to have been the result of trump 's decision to vote . " this is the first time this election has happened , " one pollster says . " it â€™ s going to be very difficult . "
