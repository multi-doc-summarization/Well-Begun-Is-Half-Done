the new york times is out with a fascinating story about adolf hitler 's death , and it 's a doozy of a story out of new york city . it 's the story of a man named edward dean who obtained the fuhrer from the dachau concentration camp in germany last year , detailing how he snuck into the bavarian alps and opened fire on a wooden pedestal . " i have never in my life met anyone who shared the political views of the third reich , " he says . " they would not have been made for the general public. ‚Äù there were no signatures in the book to suggest ownership , or the identity of the photographer , eva braun , and others , among other things , including the fuhrer 's head , and the author of the book , which was published in 1974 . it 's not clear how many people were killed in the bunker , but it was n't the only one to have been blown off by the dachau survivor , the guardian reports . " it was a bit of a puzzle , " tredwen says . " i was just trying to figure out what it was going to happen . " he adds that he did n't want photographs coming out that made him look bad , and that he was " very competitive , " and that " we were literally only there to collect . world war ii was one of the biggest events to affect the world .
