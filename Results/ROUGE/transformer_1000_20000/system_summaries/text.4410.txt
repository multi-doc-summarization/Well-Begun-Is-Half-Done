" this is unusual , and not what we ’ ve seen before , " tulane university archaeologist john verano tells the guardian . " especially on the coast of peru. , it ’ s not a place where you ’ d think to look , " he says , per the guardian . the remains of 42 children were sacrificed in a ceremony at tulane beach , where the remains were found . the remains , along with 76 llamas , are believed to have been buried in the cemetery , which is believed to be the largest cemetery in the world , reports the guardian . researchers say they 've found evidence that the sacrifice may have been an offering to the sea , or a response to severe flooding brought on by an el niño event . they say the bones were found at the site , and they believe that the remains belong to the deceased . " the bones of the deceased are not children , " says a researcher . " it is an exciting discovery . " the discovery of the remains suggests that the llamas , which were found in a squatting position on the beach , have been excavated in 2011 , and the national geographic reports that it 's unclear why the llamas were conquered , but they say they have n't uncovered any connection between the two groups . the guardian reports that the excavations are being carried out by archaeologists , who are investigating the site .
