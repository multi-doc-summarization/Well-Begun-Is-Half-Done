boston marathon bomber judy tsarnaev has been sentenced to death in the death of three people , the ap reports . according to the ap , the lawyers on monday explains that the legal term " crime of violence " was applied to tsarnaev 's older brother , william fick , who was convicted of 30 federal charges in the bombing of the boston marathon , which killed three people and injured more than 200 others . the lawyers say the trial is unconstitutional , and the new york times reports that it 's not clear whether tsarnaev will get a fair trial in the city and that he will be allowed to speak freely about the death penalty . tsarnaev was sentenced in june for helping his brother carry out the new trial . the boston globe reports that the filing is expected to take years to finalize the trial . tsarnaev 's lawyer says the trial should be delayed because of the " continuous and unusual punishment " of the sentence . but the ap notes that the court has n't ruled that the tsarnaev brothers will be held outside the city because they could n't avoid outrage over the israeli-palestinian conflict .
