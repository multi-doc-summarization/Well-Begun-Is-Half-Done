the president of the national football league is backtracking after a 1943 rally in which he railed against president trump , the new york times reports . " to believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and instead of a compulsory routine , " he said , per the washington post . " it is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our minds to free minds . " he added , " we are not going to white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders . " but he added that he did n't know what to do with the anthem , and that it was " a great honor until you showed up ! " in a tweet , trump said he was " not going ! so ai n't no invite , " per the times , which notes that the president 's stance on the issue was a " disaster " and that he 's " not cavalier " about the attacks . " i do n't know how many people are going to do this , " trump said , adding , " i 've never seen a lot of people in the past . " the times notes that while some of the blame for trump 's remarks were n't enough to convince the nfl to " get that son of a bitch off the field right now . " the washington examiner reports that the court decision from just three years earlier came to light on the controversy over the national anthem controversy . ( the nfl is trying to deflect criticism from its handling of the parkland shooting . )
