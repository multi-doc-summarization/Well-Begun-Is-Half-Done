seven decades after norway 's prime minister apologized to women who were mistreated over world war two-era relationships with german soldiers . " for many , this was just teenage love , for some , the love of their lives , " the son of a norwegian woman who was expelled in 1945 tells the bbc . " the people directly affected are no longer with usâ€¦ but this also touches their families and the children , " he says . " we can not say women who had or were helping the german war effort . " the bbc reports that the 50,000 women were born in the country with their children , but they were placed in host families or special institutions and later battled for compensation . the guardian reports that many of the 28 norwegian women married to german women during the war were subsequently expelled or deprived of their nationality . the guardian calls the apology " important for history " and says it has " no citizen should be punished outside the court system . " but the bbc notes that it 's not the first time the un 's universal declaration of human rights has been withdrawn from the country . the guardian notes that in a statement wednesday , german girls were treated for " post-war stance " and " german soldiers " who died in love with nazi troops .
