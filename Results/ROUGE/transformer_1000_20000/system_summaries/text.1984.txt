" we have shown that we have the technologies as well as the knowledge to become sustainable and safeguard our blue planet , " the team says in a statement . " if he could do it , he would prove to the world that there are other alternatives to solar power and even an encounter with pirates . " the ship , which was built by new zealander craig loomes , is expected to be built by the german entrepreneur immo stroeher , who helped provide the funds to make this idea possible . " we are considering renting out the boat for scientific or commercial uses or even selling it , " stroeher says . " it 's not a super-fast pace . but there were stops along the way to promote lithium batteries . " according to the guardian , the ship will be built in <unk> , monaco , japan , and the uk . it will be installed in the suez world on sept. 27 , 2010 . it will also be installed on a <unk> boat in the pacific ocean , where it can be used for commercial purposes .
