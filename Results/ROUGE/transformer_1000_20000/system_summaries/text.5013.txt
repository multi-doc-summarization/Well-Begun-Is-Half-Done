colorado voters overwhelmingly approved a measure that would impose a 15 % tax on marijuana to help fund the state 's minimum wage , the new york times reports . according to the wall street journal , voters in 11 states are considering the question of whether they want to secede from the state . " among other things , it would also require statewide and congressional approval , " says a spokesman for the colorado legislative council . " but approval or even a close vote at the county level would send a loud message of growing grassroots anger toward a more liberal denver-based democratic establishment that has taken up measures such as beer . " the new tax increases are expected to generate nearly $ 70 million in additional state tax revenue next year , the ap reports . colorado voters have been asked to raise their support for the measure , but they have n't said how much they will do . " i do n't think i 'm going to be here , " one voter says . " i think it 's going to happen . " but there 's still plenty of measures on the ballot in six states , including colorado , louisiana , and mississippi , and tennessee . " i 'm not going to have to wait to see if there 's a chance of becoming reality . "
