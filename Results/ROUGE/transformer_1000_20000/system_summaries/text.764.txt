george w. bush is in the midst of a three-day episode of the white house , and it 's not the first time he 's ever seen before . in a memoir published tuesday by the dallas morning news , cheney reveals that he 's not going to be the first shovel-ready project in history . " i believe the ultimate responsibility of a leader is to not do what is necessary and right , " he says . " it 's a rare public appearance since his long hospital stay for heart trouble earlier this year . " cheney also says he 's " not going anywhere , " but he 's still trying to figure out what he 's talking about . the new york times reports that cheney 's attendance at the bush presidential library has been largely positive , with the times noting that he has " no recollection " of the book , which he sees as an attempt to distract from the bush administration . cheney says he has no regrets about the decision , but he does n't believe it will be his final decision . he says he is " delighted " by the speeches , and that he will " continue to focus on the priorities of the american people , " the times reports . " we have a lot to do with the fact that we 've been able to achieve that goal , " cheney says . " we 've never seen anything like this . "
