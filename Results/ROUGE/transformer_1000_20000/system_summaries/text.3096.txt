jeffrey michels , 64 , is being held by the us air force base in north dakota on july 6 , 1977 , when he was found living a double life in sanford , fla. , on thursday , wftv reports . according to the new york daily news , michels had been using the name in 1998 to obtain a license from the state of florida for his construction business called atlantic development corporation . he was arrested and charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy . according to a police report seen by wftv , michels was arrested in connection with the iraq war fewer than one per day . the military rarely enforces the highest sentences for desertion . " there is no statute of limitations for desertion , and michels will stand trial in a military court . however , the outstanding number is estimated to be between two to three years , up to the death penalty . michels 's lawyers say he can not get a fair trial following criticism from trump during last year 's presidential campaign . " the military does not keep strict records for servicemen and women who have deserted , " says a lawyer for the idaho native . " this ranges from a dishonourable discharge , a prison term typically between two and three cent of the served prison time . even at the time , it has to be demonstrated that their action left serving personnel in danger .
