if you 're looking for a moon in the sky , you 're not going to be able to get the moon out of the sky . the national weather service says the " graze line " is simply a matter of a star vanishing behind the moon and then reappearing an hour or so later . " you 'll be on the night of october 19th/20th , " the international occultation timing association says in a press release . " we 'll be watching the moon occult as the bright star aldebaran . " the moon will be visible on the edge of the moon , which is what folks in most of the eastern and southern us are stumped as to whether the meteors will be classified as " total grazing . " it 's the first time the moon has been spotted in a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and telescope notes . it 's not clear how many of the stars will be in the area , but slooh plans to broadcast live footage of the night sky . ( the moon is expected to be visible in argentina . )
