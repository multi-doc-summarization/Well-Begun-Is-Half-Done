the world 's oldest library in the world is finally set to reopen with strict security and a new underground canal system , reports the guardian . the <unk> qarawiyyin library , located in the old medina of fez al-qarawiyyin , is tasked with preserving the <unk> manuscripts , which are located in a <unk> canal system . it 's not clear how many of the books will be distributed , but it 's the first time such a library has been erected in the country since 1945 . " the people who work here jealously guard the books , " says one of the researchers . " they have a lot to do with it . " the library says it 's looking into how the library is framing it , and it has n't been able to identify the books . " it 's a <unk> copy of the book , written in the script , " the project 's director tells the guardian . " it was like healing wounds . " but it does n't look like it will be used to create a flammable <unk> , a flammable machine , and a machine that treats the manuscripts with the <unk> . it 's also the first such instance of a typo in the <unk> , which is used to be used by the government to create the manuscripts . " it ’ s a really big deal , " he says . " i don ’ t know what it is . "
