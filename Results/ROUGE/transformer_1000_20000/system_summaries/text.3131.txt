" our capacity to support 700,000 people in the short-term â€” we could n't do it . and certainly if we had to mount a response over the intermediate-term , if there was too much damage in the city , then it would test us to the breaking point , " says the humanitarian coordinator for iraq , lise grande . she says the airstrike was carried out by isis militants in syria and syria from syria to iraq , where isis militants have killed at least 1.5 million civilians . " in the worst case scenario , we ca n't rule out the possibility that there may be a chemical weapons attack , " she says , adding that the city is " still short and everyone who 's working on this operation knows that . " she adds that isis militants are now targeting isis militants , as well as targeting terrorist groups , and that they 're not planning to attack the militants .
