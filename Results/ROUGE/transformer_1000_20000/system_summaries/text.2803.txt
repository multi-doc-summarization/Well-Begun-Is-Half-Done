" we 're here to create the greatest videogame adaptation of all time . who 's with us ? if this receives enough comments , i 'll tell you guys if grant is in it ; show less cowardice . it 's not a step forward , or step backwards , it 's just a massive step sideways . after having read all these wonderful scripts , i feel like sidestepping this issue doesn ’ t solve it when the whole purpose of the culture you had a hand in creating , then you are too afraid to comment on the culture , especially when it ’ s a component of non-partisan television , " indian-american adi shankar writes in the new york times . " the only way to make apu work without getting rid of him . " the simpsons , meanwhile , has apologized for the decision to remove the simpsons 's character from the simpsons . " i was informed a few days ago , however , that i was a finalist of 30 out of 200 though he did n't get the # apu comp script , " he writes . " the harvard-educated load of nonsense is that apu is to bring us together . " he adds that the simpsons " has become a better place now that that that script is gone ? " ( see the video here . )
