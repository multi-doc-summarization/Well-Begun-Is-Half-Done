" being dependent of just one source of income makes an economy incredible vulnerable to price and makes forward very difficult , " says saudi deputy crown prince mohammad bin salman . " we will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity addiction in saudi arabia , " he says . " i think by 2020 , if oil stops we can survive .
