michele and michele bachmann are n't exactly overflowing with sympathy , but they 're not so sure . " i do n't know how they got me to do half the stuff i did , " she tells time . " but my mom always told me , growing up , 'barbra streisand did n't get a nose job . ' and if anybody needed it , i probably did . " she also says she 's " never shot in so little clothing " and that she wants to " do my version of a family show . but we try to be as responsible as we can , because we know some young people watch . one of the more surreal moments in the 'glee'-skyrockets-to-fame story is that people are tuning in to the white house . " the last thing i want to do is kind of imply to readers in high school that you too can drop out and be an actor and get on a big show and be famous and make a s***load of money . " " i was one of my only girls in my <unk> did n't . f*** those people . it was like , 'oh yeah , i 'm going to go home . ' "
