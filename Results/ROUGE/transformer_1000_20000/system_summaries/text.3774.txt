if you 're looking for a ninth planet in our solar system , you 're going to have to wait a little longer . that 's the conclusion of a new horizons astronomer at caltech 's institute of technology announced wednesday , per the washington post . " the astronomers suggest it might have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of jupiter or saturn , " michael brown and konstantin batygin say in a press release . " i went into astronomy studying some of the most distant galaxies , but i fell in love with this field because planetary science is something i got into when i was in grad school , " brown and his team discovered eris , a dwarf planet more than 30 dwarf planets , per phys.org . the new horizons telescope , which is believed to be the first planet to take pluto 's place in the history books , is a " massive perturber . " the bbc notes it 's not the first time the international astronomical union voted in 1992 to define " planet nine " for its first time . the bbc reports it 's unclear why pluto will be able to hear the planet 's orbit , though it does n't appear to be on the verge of being usable . the bbc adds it 's possible the ninth planet will be downgraded to the eighth planet in the solar system .
