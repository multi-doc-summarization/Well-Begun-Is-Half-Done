donald trump 's primary policy proposal to build a wall on the border between the united states and the middle east is getting a lot more attention . the washington post reports that the wall street journal , which calculates that at least at least $ 25 billion , the wall will cost anywhere from $ 4 billion to $ 12 billion . the guardian reports that while trump insists mexico will pay for the wall , there 's zero evidence for that . " where does the wall go ? as oliver points out , this is n't as easy a question to answer as you might think . large parts of the border are made up of the rio grande river , " he writes . the guardian notes that trump 's plan to pay for a wall along the border fence is " costly " and " costly . " oliver says the idea is to make it easier for trump to do so , and it 's not clear whether the wall would do anything to stop the flow of unauthorized immigrants into the us . oliver says he 's " disappointed " by the idea . " i think it 's going to be a big deal , but i do n't think it will happen , " hewitt writes . " it 's time to get a fair amount of time . it 's a good thing . "
