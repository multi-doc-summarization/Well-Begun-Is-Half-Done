the fourth anniversary of the sandy hook elementary school shooting in parkland , fla. , has prompted a public service announcement : " while you were watching evan , another student was showing signs of planning a shooting . but no one would ever do that , " the ad says , per the washington post . " the psa demonstrates how easy it is for one to overlook the signs of an assault rifle , and that when one knows the signs , it can be prevented . " it 's not clear whether the yearbooks will be passed around for signatures , but the psa will teach people how to recognize someone else 's signs of violence , reports the new york times , which notes that evan 's chat partner recognizes his handwriting and reveals herself as a " participant " in the background . the yearbooks are then shown a shortened version of the same psa , which is titled " know the male student make a menacing gesture towards his teacher after receiving a poor grade , " per a psa for the school year down . the psa is aimed at protecting children from gun violence in the wake of the parkland shooting , which has been viewed more than 1.7 million times as of this writing . but the organization 's algorithms do n't seem to mesh with the psa , and they do posit a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the teen , who says it 's " bored " into a desk in his school 's halls . " i do n't think that 's going to happen , " he says . " it is a matter of time . "
