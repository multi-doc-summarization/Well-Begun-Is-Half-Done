arizona rep. trent franks says he wishes there was one more gun there that day in the hands of a responsible person , that 's all i have to say , " the day of the massacre . " i wish there had been guns there for people to defend themselves with , perhaps the carnage could have been less . " franks , who was born in the wake of saturday 's shooting , says he was " appalled " by the attack , which was a " common argument for gun-rights activists , bolstered by headlines such as this . " in this case , joe zamudio , the armed man ( with no proper weapons ) who helped stop the spree , may only have subdued the shooter , " he says . " but as william saletan wrote for slate , there is often a fine line between success and catastrophe . " the new york times reports that boehner 's comments were n't exactly the same , either : " if there 's been one more [ gun ] there that [ s ] day in [ tucson ] hands of [ capitol hill law enforcement sources , that would result in greater coordination with local law enforcement when they 're back in the district . " rep. steve king , a democrat who 's been appointed to serve as a congressman from the house and senate intelligence committee on security , called loughner a " hero " and " a hero . "
