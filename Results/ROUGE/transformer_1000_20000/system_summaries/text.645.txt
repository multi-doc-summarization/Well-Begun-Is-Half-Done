the world health organization is trying to figure out what 's behind the epidemic of pouched rats , but researchers say they 've figured out a way to combat the disease . in a study published thursday in plos one , researchers found that the rats trained by the non non <unk> non <unk> compound in east africa can infect up to a dozen people a year , the guardian reports . " we believe our unique tb rat technology will prove itself as an effective mass-screening tool , " says lead researcher johannes sahin . " it is the leading cause of death , after hiv , from funding the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) , factories and other high tb-burden countries . " the study , published in the journal of clinical sciences , found that more than 10 million new cases a year and around 2 million have been diagnosed with tb in 2014 . the study found that in tanzania , people in communities where tb is most common , including prisons , fail to show up for screening because of lack of money or awareness , creating a huge burden for health authorities trying to tackle the disease . the study also found that rats are more likely to commit tb than they are in the hands of the disease . researchers say that while they do n't have the ability to do so , they hope to expand the vaccine to all prisons , the bbc reports .
