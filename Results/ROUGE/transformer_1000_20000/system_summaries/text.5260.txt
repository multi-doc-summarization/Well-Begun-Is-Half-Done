scientists have discovered a new species of t. rex in the kyzylkum desert , but they 've found the remains of a man who lived 90 million years ago , reports nature world news . the study , published in plos one , found that t. rex , a paleontologist , had long legs and a skull with a big brain and keen hearing that would put us to shame , reports the guardian . " the ancestors of the t. rex would have looked a whole lot like timurlengia , a horse-sized hunter with a horse-sized brain and could weigh up to 250kg , " says the lead researcher . the team found that the first tyrannosaurs lived around 170 million years later and were only slightly larger than a human , reports phys.org . " it was about the size of a horse , " the team 's lead author says , per the guardian . the team had previously been studying the species for more than two decades , and the study found that tyrannosaurs had evolved into animals like t. rex and albertosaurus , which had been heralded as a " fast runner . " the study was published in the journal pnas , and it 's possible that the species could have been engineered by the late cretaceous period , but scientists have n't been able to figure out how much they could find .
