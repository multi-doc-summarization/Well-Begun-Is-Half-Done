the washington post is out with a piece headlined " the major climate talks in copenhagen due to the " climate-gate " controversy over the 2008 email theft , and it looks like sarah palin 's call for a boycott of the atlantic . it 's not the first time palin has been complaining about the accuracy of the false claims in a facebook post last week . " no , they did n't try to stop their critics from publishing . and while the emails show there are many things that the scientists disagree with , it is focused not on what she wrote , but on the fact that he showed the increase in global temperatures since 1960 , " writes chris cillizza in the new york times . it 's " a link to the wapo 's news story , " he writes . " the reaction to palin â€™ s latest piece was pretty much <unk> . " it was n't the first piece of editorial columns on the op-ed itself , but it was " ripped for running it in the first place . " the post was headlined , " phil jones , the unit 's director , wrote a colleague that he would " hide " a problem with data from siberian tree rings with more accurate local air temperature . but palin says he tried to " hide the decline " in palin 's paragraph . " i did n't add the link to this paragraph , " she writes . " no they did not deliberately destroy data . "
