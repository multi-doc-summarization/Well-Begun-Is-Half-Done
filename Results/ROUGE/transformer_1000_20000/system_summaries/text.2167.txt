the lincoln university of texas is getting a lot of flak over its handling of the obesity epidemic : a new requirement for students to take a fitness for life , the washington post reports . " it 's not up to lincoln to tell me how much my bmi should be . i came here to get a degree and that 's what the administration should be concerned with , " says the chair of the department of health , physical education , and recreation department . the university says it 's looking into whether the bmi of the student 's bmi is over 30 , but it 's unclear whether it will be enough for a student to have a bmi below 30 or so , the post reports . the university 's first class of the school 's student college students will be in danger of not being able to take part in a physical exam , but the school says it does n't have the authority to do so , and it does not require a stipend from the university . " we do n't know what it 's going to do , " the school superintendent says . " but we do know that it 's a professional responsibility to be honest and tell students they 're not healthy. . "
