" it 's " a profound grasp of foreign affairs , " writes david frum at the atlantic . " this is a powerful example of what we ’ re talking about , " he writes . " we ’ ve got to say that our current president believes his task will help us better understand what happened . " lizza writes that he 's " frustrated " by the president 's decision to strike down the issue , but that does n't mean it 's time to get a deeper sense of humor . " i think it 's going to be a big deal , but i do n't know what it is , and i don ’ t know how much it will be . " the editorial , however , suggests that it 's a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . "
