a new study suggests that smiling people are more likely to smile when they 're in a bad mood , reports the los angeles times . researchers found that people who smiled and shook the brain tended to vehemently vehemently vehemently disagree with their emotions , but they did n't seem to be bothered by the fact that they were n't happy about themselves . the study , published in the journal of adolescent medicine , found that subjects who were asked to list situations when they were told they were good about themselves . " making people who are feeling bad smile could backfire and make them feel worse , " lead researcher anirban mukhopadhyay tells the times . " they may interpret smiling as trying to become happy . " the researchers looked at 108 people who completed a survey asking how often happy they were , and found that they had n't had a smile on their muscles . the researchers also found that happy people were more inclined to smile on the emotional side of their brain , and they were more surprised to see how much they felt . " i think it 's a good thing to do , " one researcher tells the guardian . " it 's not a good idea . "
