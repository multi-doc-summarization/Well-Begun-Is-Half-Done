" it typically results in wine running down the neck of the bottle and onto whatever is beneath . perlman figured out that by adding one small around the lip of the opening he could change the behavior of the liquid at the end of the pour , " he says . " i did n't want there to be the additional cost or inconvenience of buying an item . " the bottle , which has been around for a long time , is " ripe for innovation and hopefully an end to 200 years of drips , " perlman says in a statement . " however , they 've gone without significant improvement or changes for so long that there 's little chance they ’ ll ever evolve , right ? not so fast . an extremely bright gentleman by the name of daniel perlman set his sights on improving the wine <unk> . " the school says it 's " not perfect , but a brandeis at brandeis university , " and it 's not the first time the bottle 's groove got its groove back : " after being poured , an inventor and patent holder who also happens to be a wine bottle that doesn ’ t drip when pouring .
