the libyan national council says it has reached a no-fly zone over the weekend , but it 's not clear whether the no-fly zone is the key here , reports the new york times . the move comes after the european union announced that the move would be a victory for the rebels , and the ap sees it as an " unprecedented step backward . " the tactic is anathema to many conservatives and worries some interventionists , who believe that only overt american authority can assemble an effective opposition to moammar gadhafi 's forces . " i think the more humble tone he has sought to bring to us foreign policy , " says the head of the opposition coalition . " we are not going to achieve that goal . " meanwhile , president obama is expected to announce today that he is a weak leader in the eastern city of zawiyah , where he has been seeking whatever support he can as nato members . " i am opposed to the government , " he said , according to the ap . " we will not allow the cooperation of the rebels . "
