" the new line made its first appearance in an online video that will begin airing monday , the ap reports . the chain says in a statement that the new motto is intended to remind people that " they can and should live how they want . it 's ok to not be perfect ... self-expression is most important and it 's our differences that make us individuals instead of robots . " burger king , however , says it 's not the only one trying to project a hip , non-corporate attitude to gain favor with customers . " we want to evolve from just being the functional side of things to having a much stronger emotional appeal , " he says . " it may seem odd for a fast-food company to champion individuality , but the ability to customize a burger . by contrast , he said " live more " in spanish , and that " have been your way to burger king 's playbook . " but the new york times points out that mcdonald 's is fighting to boost sales at a time when people are moving toward foods they feel fresher or higher quality .
