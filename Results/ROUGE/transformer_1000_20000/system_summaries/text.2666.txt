when clare shaw was home from the army—also coast of noank , connecticut , on june 26 , she found out she was lost and now found alive . " after turning around and back tracking for hours , having the coast guard involved , and everyone on shore looking we weren ’ t able to find our puppy who we thought didn ’ t know how to swim , " she tells the connecticut post . " we then got a call from our friend , tommy nahornick , who was headed out on my boat to fish . " shaw , a coast guard veteran , says he saw the pup on the boat , but it was n't the only thing shaw could think was that her lost life . " my family came home and we felt defeated , we packed up his things and lit a candle in his cage and assumed our boy lost his life , " he says . " he was shaking and scared . " the family , who had been friends since 9 years old , says they were told they had to go to the dock , but they did n't find any trace of the puppy , and that they had n't seen it . " it was like a normal day , " shaw says . " i replied , 'that ’ s a good spot ? ' and i ’ ve never seen anything like that . i ’ m just trying to be a little bit more like a lot of people , but i don ’ t think that ’ s what we will call him . ' " ( this man 's puppy saved his life . )
