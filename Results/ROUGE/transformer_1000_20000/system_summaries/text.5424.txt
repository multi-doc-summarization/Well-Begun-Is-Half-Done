" obviously this package is not going to solve climate change by itself , but it is a good step forward , " says the head of the south american country , where the un decision was taken without the agreement . " i of course note your position , but if there are no other objections , the document will see all countries committed to cutting emissions for the first time . " the deal is expected to take effect next week , and the ap reports that it 's not clear whether the deal will be reached , but the un says it wo n't be able to amend the agreement , which would allow the eu to do so .
