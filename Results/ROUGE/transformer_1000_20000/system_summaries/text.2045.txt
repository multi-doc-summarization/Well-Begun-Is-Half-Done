a german artist buried a gold-rush worth of gold as part of an arts festival in kent on thursday , the bbc reports . michael sailstorfer has hidden 30 24-carat gold bars on folkestone 's harbour beach , which takes place every three years and runs from 30 august to 2 . " there are 30 gold bars buried there , along with a lot of washers , so if you bring your metal detector to find a gold . we will never know if the gold has been found or not , " says the curator of the town 's triennial arts festival . " it is about people coming to the beach and digging and possibly finding treasure . some people will not get lucky , and that 's life . " he says it was hoped people digging on the beach would create a work of art by making sand castles at the same time . " the bars are of different sizes and standard gold bullion made in london , although anyone expecting the kind of gold spade would be able to come and dig for it . " it 's a participatory artwork , " biggs tells the bbc , which notes that the tide is out of abundance because it 's not known if it is going to be worth more as an artwork . " the idea of the gold spade project is to make it easier for members of the art studios to use it , " he adds .
