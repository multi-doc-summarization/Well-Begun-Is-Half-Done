the supreme court 's decision to overturn the voting rights act was a unanimous decision today , and the justices seemed to agree on whether the law was repealed , reports the new york times . " the more conservative majority was plainly not persuaded by either point , " said john g. breyer , who dissented in the decision . " it was not a proper plaintiff because it inevitably would be covered and the broader argument that there was a sufficient record to justify the current formula . " it 's not clear whether the court will write an opinion forbidding a preclearance regime from declaring that the law violated the constitution 's free-speech rights act , notes the washington post . the decision is expected later this week , but the white house is expected to vote on the law , which would require congress to pass the law . " the law does not apply to the constitution , " says a spokesman for the naacp . " it may be difficult for congress to enact a new measure . " the court 's liberal wing , meanwhile , is unimpressed . " the question is whether it 's a racial entitlement ? " asks allahpundit at hot air .
