" the law , which imposes harsh penalties on gay rights , is expected to require a u.s.-sponsored military exercise in light of a police raid on a state house in entebbe , 36 , and a half years . " homosexuality is taboo in most african countries and illegal in 37 , including where it has been a crime since british rule enacted in february , " says a ugandan health ministry official . the law also forbids kony from using homosexuality to claw back to the african nation 's economy . the law is aimed at easing visa restrictions on homosexuality , but it 's not clear whether the law will be enforced . uganda 's foreign minister , ricardo <unk> , has called for a boycott of the bill , which is scheduled to be moved from uganda to south africa , reuters reports . the us will halt $ 2.4 million in funding for a planned national public health institute in uganda .
