the fcc is trying to figure out how to regulate net neutrality rules , but it 's going to have to do so . the fcc today announced that the agency 's all-important vote on net neutrality would be " redefined by the courts , congress and other entities including the marketplace going forward , " the new york times reports . " it is a defining moment , " says the head of the fcc . " but whatever they decide is going to be a benchmark . " the move comes after the fcc 's decision to vote on the divisive issue of net neutrality , the wall street journal reports . the board is considering changing its rules to prevent internet service providers from blocking , slowing down or speeding up certain types of traffic . " the rules do n't apply to isps as a utility , " a spokesman for the federal communications commission says . " we have no idea what to do with net neutrality . " but the journal notes that it 's not the first time the fcc has made its decision to regulate its rules , which it sees as an attempt to preserve net neutrality . the journal sees the move as an " attempt to distract consumers into the future . " the editorial , however , says that the rules are " very different , " and that it " will not ultimately provide a fair response . "
