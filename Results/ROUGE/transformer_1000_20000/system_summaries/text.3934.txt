it 's been a rough week for china , but it 's not the first time the country has seen an extraordinary talk show called for a criminal to do an interview when they are about to be executed . " some criminals i interviewed me : ' i 'm really very glad . i said so many things in my heart to you at this time . in prison , there was never a person i was willing to talk to about past events , " ding yu and her team said in a statement , per the guardian . the show 's format may seem exploitative , but ding disagrees . " some viewers may consider it cruel to ask a criminal , " she says . " i witness the transition from life to ding ding amnesty international in the near future . " the guardian reports that ding dong <unk> , 55 , has been interviewed by a prisoner every week until it was taken off air , and the telegraph notes that she has n't been seen since . " i 've never seen political prisoners or cases where the crime was in question , and i think it 's time to get people to know what it was going to happen . "
