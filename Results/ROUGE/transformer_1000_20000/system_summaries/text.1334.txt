a squirrel over the last few weeks has been identified as kevin mcdonald , who was shoveling snow away from the side of his house when he was attacked . " all of a sudden i felt something on my back and shoulders , scratching , " he tells the east street journal . he says he threw the animal off , but it twice jumped back onto his arms and retreated to his house . it was a " bit eerie to have the squirrel not only jump him , but jump back onto him after being thrown off . " i thought it was funny until i learned of two other people being attacked , " says kevin mcdonald . the squirrel was raised as a pet and lost its fear of infection . the animal is currently in rabies , and it 's not clear whether the squirrel contracted rabies to a human , though it is n't clear whether it was related to the squirrel . " it is rabid ? " says a game warden , who says he 's spoken to two people on the same street . " the first thing that goes through your mind is ‘ it rabid ? ’ " he says , adding that it was n't the only one who attacked him the day prior to the incident .
