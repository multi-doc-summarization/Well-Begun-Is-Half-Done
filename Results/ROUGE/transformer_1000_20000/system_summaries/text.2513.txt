scientists have discovered a large reservoir of water that sits under the greenland ice sheet , the bbc reports . according to a press release , the water is stored in the air space between 1992 and 2011 . researchers say the aquifer , which covers an estimated 215 billion tons of snow , is the equivalent of 0.4mm of sea level rise per year . " this discovery was a surprise , " says lead researcher rick forster of the university of utah . " instead of the juice in a snow cone , it would be a bit isolated and completely acting as a system that is draining into the ocean or if it is currently connected to a slush drink . " the study , published in nature geoscience , found that the aquifer will help scientists figure out how old the water will be . " we do n't know the ultimate destination of the water in the reservoir , " forster says , adding that the amount of water being stored in " the air between the ice particles , " would be the result of the summer melt , the guardian reports . forster says the aquifer was found in the spring of 2011 , but it was n't until recently , when it was discovered in a liquid state through the greenland winter . researchers say that in the past 100 years , there was no evidence that liquid water flowed back to the surface even though it was well below normal levels of snow . the scientists say that while they do n't have the water to extract the water , they have no evidence of the existence of the aquifer . ( meanwhile , scientists are trying to figure out
