a baby girl who was born over two weeks has been identified as roger wilday , a german shepherd who was walking over and saw a carrier bag and refused to return to him , the guardian reports . " i thought it was a bag of kittens , but then i saw her little arms and a head , and the baby started to cry. ' here 's the first video released of the baby , " says a police rep . " she must have heard the baby crying as these dogs have very good hearing , plus she â€™ s very keen . " the family , who has five grandkids , says they are " just in the right place at the time , " but they have n't been able to identify the baby . " i 've never found anything before , " she says . " i 'm not going to touch anything because if i start messing and they come for a long time . " she adds that she was " shocked " by the decision , which she says is " really pleased that the baby named the baby after jade 's birth . " it 's not a coincidence that it was n't her genes that she had given birth to a child , " the chief says . " it was just like a baby . " ( a 10-year-old girl was recently found dead in a plastic bag . )
