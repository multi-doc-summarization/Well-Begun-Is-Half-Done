samsung has unveiled a new privacy policy for its users , and it 's not the first time the company has used it . " please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information , that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice , " the company says in a statement , per the verge . " there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment . how often , or on what system , the thought police plugged in on the screen , so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal commanded , he could be seen as well as heard . " samsung will not collect your spoken word , samsung says , but the policy states that it can be turned off through the prism of the feature , the new york times reports . the verge notes that the policy is designed to create a " <unk> , <unk> tv system , " but it does n't seem to be working on it . " it 's a very low whisper , " one astronomer tells the times . " it â€™ s not a metaphor . "
