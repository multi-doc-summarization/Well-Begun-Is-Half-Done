" i do n't know what i 'm going to do , " he told fox news on sunday , per the hill . " it 's going to happen . " he added , per politico , that the nsa is " an appropriate way of reviewing these policies , " and that " we ca n't actually go in there and - other than the two that have been released . give the public an actual idea of people who have been saved , that kind of thing is going to be a lot easier to do . " mccain , who was in california for his oldest son 's wedding , says he was n't surprised by the data-mining program , which was attended by 27 senators , the new york times reports . he says he has no plans to speak to the public , and he has n't spoken to the white house about it . he says it 's not clear whether the nsa will be able to do anything about the nsa 's surveillance programs , but it does n't look like it will be used to do so . politico reports that the senate intelligence committee has said it will review its findings , and the washington post says it will investigate the matter .
