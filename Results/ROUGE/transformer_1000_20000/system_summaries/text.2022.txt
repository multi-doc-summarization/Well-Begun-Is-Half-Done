allison williams ' six-month stint as nbc live action event in new york city has been involved in the iraq war , and now she 's trained in acting as a member of the improvisational comedy group . " this has been a really hard time . we have also been very lucky , counting our blessings . we have each other . it 's been incredible to experience the outreach from people you love , family , and then people we do n't even know , strangers , just reaching out saying we want him back on tv , " she says in a statement , per the guardian . " we have our health . " williams , who was born with a ba in english , says she 's in her father 's corner . " one thing the experience has not done is is so much belief that he was going to make it like he did n't want to be a part of that . " she adds that she has no regrets about being fired at iraq in 2003 , when she refined improv teacher peter pan live , which aired the fourth season of girls posthumously . " i 've never seen anything like that , but i have no idea what it was like , " williams says . " it 's not my dad , who bears the full burden of responsibility for it . "
