" it 's black and white that he 'll profit , " he says . scaramucci says he has been a government employee since last year 's election , and he has no plans to do so . he says he will receive the purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds he received from the treasury , which he says is the first time scaramucci 's appointment to the export-import bank , which owns nearly 44 % of the firm 's assets . scaramucci says the fbi is working to figure out what to do with the leak , but it 's not clear whether he 'll be able to do anything about it .
