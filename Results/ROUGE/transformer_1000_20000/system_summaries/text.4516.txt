donald trump 's press conference is getting a lot of laughs , and it 's a doozy of a <unk> . the new york times reports that the question was posed by nbc news reporter peter alexander , who asked trump about the language he uses . " i know , you ’ re so politically correct , " he said . " oh , look at you . awwww . aw , he ’ ve never heard a little bad , a little off , language . you know what ? it ’ s stuff like that . " he then pivoted to assert that trump had been trying to get rid of the " pussy " ad , which he called " the world 's greatest steaks. . " trump , meanwhile , is stumping for trump , saying he 's " so proud " of trump , though he 's not sure why he 's going to sleep with his daughter if they weren ’ t related—had this to say , " i don ’ t think that ’ s what i ’ m talking about . " he added , " it was a great day for donald trump . " the washington post notes that trump is n't the only one to do with trump , but he does n't have a problem with trump . " it 's not the first time trump has been talking about it , " trump said , adding that he does not believe trump 's speech will be a " distraction " and " reeks of desperation . "
