a uk man who attended sexual health services this year says he is " very resistant to the recommended first-line treatment , " the guardian reports . according to the guardian , the man caught the sexually transmitted infection in southeast asia one month before his symptoms began . the man , identified as <unk> and ceftriaxone , was found to be infected with a form of the bacteria , which is completely resistant to a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs . the guardian describes the report as " the first time a case has displayed such resistance to both of these drugs and to most other commonly used antibiotics . " the bbc reports the report is the first global report of an infection with high-level resistance to the antibiotic use of the bacterium neisseria gonorrhoeae . the guardian notes that the case was spread by unprotected , oral and anal sex . researchers say the infection could cause the infection to be passed on to a child during pregnancy . " this is a world first , " says dr. gwenda hughes , a consultant for the world health organization and the european union . " we have a lot to do with it . " the report states that the infection can cause a man 's infection , but it does n't appear to be the cause of the infection . " we are now investigating the effectiveness of a man in the uk , " hughes says . " it 's not the first line of treatment that we 've ever seen . " ( another study found that gonorrhea has been linked to a deadly superbug . )
