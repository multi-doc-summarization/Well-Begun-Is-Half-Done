president trump 's tweets railing against the national anthem at the national preseason games thursday night were n't exactly a surprise . " be happy , be cool ! a football game , that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy , is no place to protest . most of that money goes to the players anyway . find another way to protest . stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay ! " he tweeted . the nfl , meanwhile , said it was " unable to define what they are protesting and suggesting the athletes should " be cool . " the nfl has n't commented on the controversy , but it 's not clear whether it will be a hoax or a hoax . the washington post has a roundup of reactions to the protest , including one of the players who spoke to the media about the anthem protests , which began two seasons ago in opposition to racial injustice and police brutality . the new york times reports that the president 's claim to have been " vocal and specific about their protests , " and the times notes that the nfl is n't commenting on the protests . the nfl , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
