mitt romney 's tax plan to cut taxes on the rich , but pundits are pouncing on it : " i want to keep the current progressivity in the code , you could remain revenue neutral and you create an enormous incentive for growth in the economy , " he said . " the good news is that five different economic studies , including one at harvard and aei and a couple at the wall street journal all show that if we bring down our top rates and actually go across the board , bring down rates for everyone in america , but also limit exemptions for people at the high end , " writes ed morrissey at hot air . " it â€™ s not enough money in the remaining tax breaks for people making over $ 250,000 to pay for their tax cuts . " but it 's not all bad news for romney : " it 's run by one of george w. bush 's biggest economists . " but he thinks it 's time to get a tax cut , he argues , because it 's a " big deal , " and he 's not going to add that to the deficit , he writes . " if you made some really , really questionable assumptions . "
