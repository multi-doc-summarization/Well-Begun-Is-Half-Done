survivors of one of australia 's deadliest wildfires have been awarded nearly 500 million dollars in damages , the bbc reports . the fire , which killed 119 people , was the biggest in a series of blazes that tore through the southern australian state of victoria in 2009 . " no amount of money will ever compensate those who were affected by the fire for the losses they have suffered , " says attorney andrew watson , who represents the plaintiffs . " but this settlement of nearly $ 500 million represents a measure of justice and some real compensation that will ease the financial burden of their suffering . " the plaintiffs sued a power company for negligence in 2009 , saying it had agreed to pay a total of 18 months to distribute the payouts , the ap reports . the plaintiffs say the fire began when an electricity line failed between two poles and a cable stay supporting the pole . the conductor , who was negligent in the accident , said the fire had been damaged by lightning . " it has been a tough , five years since the fire killed our son , left our daughter without her big brother and destroyed our home , " he said . " there is so much pain that is still very real , but today there is also a sense of justice . "
