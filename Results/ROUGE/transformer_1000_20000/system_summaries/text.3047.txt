a german battleship and a bete noir of britain 's winston churchill have been hit by an environmental attack , the bbc reports . " it was n't until we spoke to a local scientist based in tromso that we made the connection to the tirpitz , " says scott st. george 's institute on the environment who took part in the study . " of course we wondered , why is that ? " hartl says . " the first suspect was insect infestation , which can come suddenly and have severe impacts , especially in boreal forests . " the study , published in the journal plos one , found that the smoke drifted into the forests surrounding the fjord and damaged nearby pine and birch trees . " we got back to the lab and measured the tree rings , and saw that they were very narrowâ€”in some cases nearly 1945 , " hartl tells afp . " the forests , in other words , had been collecting wood for a year , " he adds . " the smoke damaged the smoke . " the germans had a counter-plan : it measured the size of a <unk> ( 820-foot ) , but it was only a matter of time . the researchers say it 's possible the attacks began in 1944 , when the germans began channeling the 1880s about the same size . but it turns out that the germans did n't do enough to spot the trees in the middle of the 20th century , and that 's why they did n't have a problem with the fact that it did n't work in the area . ( another recent study found that insects may have sunk to extinction . )
