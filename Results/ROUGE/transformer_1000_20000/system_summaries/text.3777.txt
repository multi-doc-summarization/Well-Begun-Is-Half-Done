president obama 's official portrait of the 44th president is drawing attention to the new york times , and it 's not the first time he 's promoted a conspiracy theory in relation to the former president . in a since-deleted tweet , hannity wrote : " how about that ? that 's pretty sharp . " he added : " it does not reflect my voice and message , therefore , i had it taken down . " he also added that he 's " always struck by whenever i saw his portraits , was the degree to which they challenged our conventional views of power , wealth , and privilege in recognizing the beauty and the grace and the dignity of people who are so often invisible in the painting . " the post has more on hannity 's website , which has been shared more than 600,000 times . the washington post reports that hannity 's portrait is a " yale-educated painter who 's highly regarded for his work . " but the post notes that it 's unclear why the painting was painted by kehinde wiley as the " secret sperm cells , " and that it was n't reviewed by me before publication . the post also notes that the portrait of obama 's portrait , which was unveiled monday , contains " a stark contrast to predecessors with inappropriate sexual innuendo , " as well as " <unk> .
