the trump administration is trying to figure out how to handle the ever-growing number of salvadoran immigrants in the us , but the new york times takes a closer look at what it sees as a " real blow for everyone . " the times reports that the move comes after a trump administration official issued a warning to el salvador that the us is " not living off the government , " though the times notes that the decision was made in the wake of two devastating earthquakes in el salvador . " the government has not changed its mind , " says an official . " it 's not the first time that we have to do this . " the us will end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program , which is currently being staffed by more than 1.35 million people in the country . it 's the second largest such program in the world , and the number of people who 've had permission to live and work in the americas is expected to rise as soon as next year . el salvador , meanwhile , has announced that it will lose their protected status in 2019 , but it has n't been a permanent right to remain in place .
