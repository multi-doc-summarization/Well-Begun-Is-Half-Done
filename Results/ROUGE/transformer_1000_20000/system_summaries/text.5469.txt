the wind river earthquake that struck the state of wyoming in 2013 was the result of a magnitude of 4.7 mw moment , according to a new study in earth and planetary science letters . the researchers say the quake was strange for various reasons , including climate change and climate change , the guardian reports . the quake , which is believed to be the largest ever recorded in the world , was unusually powerful , but the wind gust of wind slowed down . " this earthquake occurred well within the mantle , and likely over the earth 's crust , " lead researcher claudio vita-finzi tells the new york times . " it 's not just a matter of time . " the study 's lead author tells the guardian that " it is a very pessimistic piece of the puzzle . " in the study , researchers say that while the quake did n't cause much damage to north america , it would have been a " huge tsunami , " impairing the mantle of the us , and the pacific ocean would have to be a " world-class " quake . " it would be very difficult to predict what the earth would do , " he says . " it was a very powerful explosion . " the researchers , who studied the effects of climate change in the region , say they 've found a correlation between the meteor 's crust and the debris , which can be seen in the periphery and next year , reports the guardian . " we have a lot of questions , " says one researcher . " we do n't know how many people are going to be affected . "
