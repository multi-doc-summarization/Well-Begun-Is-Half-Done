" it 's kind of on town property and no one decided it could go there , " says the town administrator . " the town has bylaws and if we let one place put something up then why ca n't someone else ? i do n't want that to happen . " the memorial was purchased with donations from community members and some of the 40 people who witnessed the unidentified flying object , but it 's not clear who exactly owns the monument , which is currently owned by the town 's reed family . the monument 's grandmother , charlie baker , tells the berkshire eagle that it 's a " self-contained glow site .
