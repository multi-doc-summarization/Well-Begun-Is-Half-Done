marco rubio and carlos lopez-cantera were at the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in us history sunday when they had an unusually frank conversation about their political futures . " you should reconsider running for your seat , " he said , according to politico . " i don ’ t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure , i ’ m not looking at this through the lens . " he added that he was " the best candidate in the general election , " and that he would be " proud " of rubio , who has been running for his senate seat in a crowded gop primary . rubio , meanwhile , has said that he has no plans to run again for the first time since the orlando massacre , but that does n't mean he 's going to be the first republican to win the presidency . " it ’ s about our country and this election , ” he said . " i ’ ve got a lot of laughs . " the washington post reports that while rubio is expected to announce his candidacy , he will likely have to run for president in the next few weeks .
