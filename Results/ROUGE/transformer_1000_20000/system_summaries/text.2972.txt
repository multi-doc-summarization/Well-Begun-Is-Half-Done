the jackie robinson biopic 42 has been nominated for the first black major league baseball player to win the brooklyn dodgers , reports the los angeles times . " all you get is the lessons and very little of the naturalism or idiosyncrasy or personality that made the person iconic in the first place , " writes owen gleiberman in entertainment weekly . " or you get all that courtesy of a great performance , but then there 's no filmmaking or storytelling to support it . you rarely get both acting and an angle , the way you did , say , with walk the line and lincoln . it 's usually that the subjects mean so much to the filmmakers that they ca n't bring themselves to take the subjects out of their historical packaging and play with them , lest they lose their value . " robinson 's widow , chadwick boseman , says the film is " a bit more complicated than a good movie , " and that the movie is " too late , " but that does n't mean it wo n't be the case , writes lacey phillips at the chicago tribune . it 's " a good scene that goes on long enough to leave a simmer in your blood .
