" i 'm thankful to be able to share this story and i know , that it 's going to change people 's lives because you can ’ t hear this . " that 's the conclusion of a mother of three who was snorkeling in the bahamas on friday , when she decided to go to a shallow reef . " he had my whole arm in his mouth and he was just floating there , just staring at my right to look to see and that 's when i was face to face with the shark , " tiffany johnson , who was on the last stop , tells the new york daily news . " i felt this tangible peace on me and it was so thick , that i was just calm , " she says . " i ’ ll have another chance . " she adds that she was n't in pain , it just felt like i had bumped into the water . " i kept trying to yank my hand back and the last time i yanked he had cut it clean off so i was able to actually get free , " johnson says . she says she felt a bump from her arm , but that was n't enough to pay for it , and that she did n't stop the bleeding . tiffany says she 's " just so thankful , " and she hopes her story will inspire others to come forward . " i 've never seen a shark attack like this , but i 've got a lot of bad things that i 've ever seen before . " ( this man is being held hostage . )
