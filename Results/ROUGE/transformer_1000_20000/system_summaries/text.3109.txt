mitch daniels is taking flak over the president 's 2012 decision to give a speech at the american enterprise institute . " most of what i will , is strongly supported by the obama administration , " he said in a statement , per the washington post . " i salute the president , secretary [ arne duncan ] they are right about these things. ‚Äù milbank added that he does n't believe the bill is a " federal role " in education , and that it 's " jarring days to hear any conservative say anything nice about the poor black kids and public schools . " he added that the president " has no choice but to do that , " and that he 's not the only one who 's been in the white house for a long time . " i think it 's time for a president to do something that 's going to happen . " he also said he 's " not going to be a president , " but that 's not what he 's talking about . " it 's not a matter of 'could you do n't think you 're going to have a problem , but you have to do it . "
