the puerto rico federal government says it does n't have the budget to finance the shipping costs of contaminating boxes of supplies that were never sent to the island , the orlando sentinel reports . " the building where the office is located is deteriorated , aside from being old , which is why prfaa has decided to move the office to a more appropriate and dignified space to continue offering the services to the public , " the office says in a statement . " due to the many puerto rican families that have been displaced to florida because of the hurricane , we have donated the meals to puerto families in need , " mercader says . " we will soon conduct an inventory of the donations to identify which ones are fit to be given out to puerto rican evacuees in central florida. . " the island sentinel notes that the island has been closed through its central florida office since august , and it 's not clear how many boxes were on the property , but the island 's regional office says it 's still investigating whether the island will stay in central florida , where it will be closed .
