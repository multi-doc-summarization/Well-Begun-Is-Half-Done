the john snow kiss-in is a gay kiss , but it 's not a metaphor . the guardian reports that the photo was posted to social media last night , and it was posted on twitter , with the bbc noting that it was n't blocked by facebook . " hey i just saw this . before it goes too far , i just want people to know that fb have not removed the event page ; it 's still there , but _i made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting nonsense on it . " the photos i had considered using before i chose that one are much more racy , " the organizer of the london event tells the guardian . " oh the irony ! " the photo has been shared more than 19,000 times , and the bbc notes that it 's been erroneously removed from the facebook event for the first time since it was removed . the guardian notes that the photos were taken by a mob of supporters , including john snow , who posted a photo of maj. gen. richard metzger , who has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses . " i am not a regular viewer so i can â€™ t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character . "
