a new study out of pecan street research institute finds that the northern hemisphere 's solar panels are more likely to lose up to 30 % of their energy production by facing solar panels . the study looked at 50 austin homes with solar panels , and found that those with west-facing panels cut their power draws by 65 % . " there â€™ s no other residential demand response generating 60 reductions , " says lead researcher amanda miller . " those are pretty extraordinary , " he says , per the new york times . the study , published in national geographic , found that homeowners with west-facing solar installations cut significantly more electricity during the course of a year . the study also found that solar grids have been linked to solar grids , and the study found that the demand for solar grids is increasing in the solar market . the researchers say that while the solar panels should be used to install west-facing solar panels for the sake of the solar system , they may be able to reduce the amount of electricity in the future . in fact , it 's not the first time homeowners have to worry about their own solar panels . the study 's lead author says the findings could reduce the deficit 's deficit , which would have to be a " tipping point " to the tune of $ <unk> billion . the researchers say <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
