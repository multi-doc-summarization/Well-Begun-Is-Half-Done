the environmental protection agency has frozen its grant programs to freeze all contract grants and grant awards , the washington post reports . according to a hill source , the epa says it 's " pretty unusual for us to get these kinds of anonymous contacts from people at the agency , which makes me think it 's unusual , " the hill reports . according to the post , the agency says it has no plans to comply with the epa 's request to freeze grants . " the epa administration has asked that all contract and contracts are distributed at varying intervals and frequency , " an epa staffer tells reuters . the epa is investigating whether the freeze is indefinite or temporary as the epa considers it a violation of federal law . " the memo was sent to staff monday night , and it 's not clear whether the trump transition office will be notified of the freeze . the post reports that the white house has not commented on the directive , but the trump administration says the memo is being investigated by the epa . " i will say it â€™ s ok to see what happened to the epa , " says a spokesperson for the epa .
