the irish leader of perpetual war with " fake news " is backtracking after a retracted story about a donald trump aide tuesday , the ap reports . according to the new york times , caitriona perry attended a press briefing with the head of a russian investment fund . " it 's a working environment & she should be treated as a professional journalist and not reduced to her smile , " varadkar said in a statement . " there are simply no words to describe how violated i feel for her . " according to cnn , varadkar was in the first official phone call between the us leader and irish taoiseach perry , who has been unhappy with trump since he was a candidate in the oval office . the white house quickly took advantage of trump 's criticism of the irish press , and the washington post reports that it 's not clear whether a male reporter would be able to speak freely about sexism . " i do n't know what it 's going to happen , " trump said . " i 'm not going to be here . i 'm going to have to be a president . " he added that he 's " disappointed " by the reporting . " i 've never seen anything like this . i 've had a lot of people in this country , and i have a responsibility for this . "
