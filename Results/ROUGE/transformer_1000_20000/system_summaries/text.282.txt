brian cullinan was standing stage at the oscars at the 89th annual academy awards last night , but he did n't exactly use social media to sift through a photo of the two accountants who handled the photo , the los angeles times reports . " i opened the envelope and it said , 'emma stone , la land . ' that 's why i took such a long look at faye . i was n't trying to be funny , " he said , per the medium . but when he was asked about the mix-up , he said he was " sorry " for the gaffe . " it was n't very complicated , but you have to make sure you give the right envelope , " brian cullinan said . the pwc partner , who had been tasked with reviewing the works , said the relationship was " quickly enough " to fix the relationship , and that it was not followed by the fact that it had n't been a typo , but that did n't stop it . the pwc rep said it was investigating the incident , but it did n't disclose any details on the relationship . the academy did not comment on the authenticity of the tweet , but the new york post reports that it did not appear to have been definitively determined that the relationship had been staged , and it 's not clear whether it was a hoax .
