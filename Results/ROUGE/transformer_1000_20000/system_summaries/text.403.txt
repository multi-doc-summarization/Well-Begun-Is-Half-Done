amanda knox has been working as a freelance reporter for the small west seattle herald for a few years , but she 's not the only one she 's ever seen . " we simply asked her as we would ask anyone of that age and stage , if they would be interested in writing for us as a qualified writer of that scale and this level of inconsistency , " knox says in a statement , per the daily beast . " she showed me originally to give her the opportunity of a normal life , " she adds , noting that she 's " flabbergasted " to find out what she 's doing . the herald notes that knox 's roommate , meredith kercher , was found dead in the house they shared with two other women , including a bar owner . knox says she is covering everything from human-interest stories to theater like a high-school production of tom stoppard . " i do n't know what i 'm going to do , " robinson says . " it 's a very bright , capable , highly qualified writer , . " the herald adds that the paper 's author , raffaele sollecito , has not commented on knox 's death , but he says he does n't believe her story will be a hoax . " i think it 's just a matter of time , but it 's not going to happen . "
