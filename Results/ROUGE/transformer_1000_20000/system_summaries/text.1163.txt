the wall street journal reports that michael cohen , a former playboy model who has been a top gop fundraiser for trump and the party , has been under fire for a decade . the sources say the woman , who is married to the woman with whom he had an affair with trump , was told he had been contacted by the woman 's attorney . " it is unfortunate that this personal matter between consenting adults is the subject of national discussion just because of michael cohen â€™ s involvement , " says one of the sources . the journal says cohen 's lawyer , ronna mcdaniel , told the paper that cohen " had a consensual relationship " with the woman . she says she told her to " take a look " at cohen 's allegation that she was n't involved in the investigation , but she says he did n't want to be a victim . " i do n't know how much of this happened , " she says . " i 've never seen a chance to do anything about it . " the journal notes that in a statement friday , cohen said she was " deeply saddened " by the decision , which she called " deeply troubling " and said that " the developments are new to me . "
