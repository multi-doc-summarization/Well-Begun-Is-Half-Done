" we managed to collect a range of samples for three of the science teams on these rarely islands , " says andrea hayward-maher , a professor of oceanographic research . " they are basically trapped or stuck in the ice and can ’ t move. . " the ship , which was built in 1984 for 1,500 nautical miles , says it is " quite a complex and lengthy operation because of the remote location of the area . " it 's not clear what the ship will do , but it 's still not clear how much it will be . " the expedition 's leader , chris turney of british explorer sir douglas mawson , says the ship 's main purpose is to make it easier for the ship to get its way to the sea ice edge .
