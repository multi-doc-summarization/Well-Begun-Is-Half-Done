saturday night live is a countdown until trump tweets about snl alum lorne michaels : " i 'm not going to go over well internally at a white house , " he said , per the hill . " i do n't know what i 'm going to do . " he added that he needs to slow down on the gum chewing , way too many pieces in there . the new york times reports that the press secretary for a president who 's obsessed with how things play on cable tv shows like this : " it 's hard to overstate the importance of the media . " the washington post reports that spicer has been on the outs since the election , and it 's not clear how much he 's talking about the media . " i 've never seen anything like this before , " trump said . " i have no idea what i 've ever seen , but i 've been in a lot of people . " the hill reports that trump 's twitter feed has been teasing the news , with some wondering if it was n't baldwin or stewart who reportedly got under the hashtag # <unk> . the hill notes that the white house is n't commenting on the controversy , but it does n't appear to be the first time spicer has made headlines .
