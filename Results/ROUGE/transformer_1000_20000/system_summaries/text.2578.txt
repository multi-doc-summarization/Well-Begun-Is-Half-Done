mitt romney says he 's " not a time to be talking about the politics associated with what happened in aurora , colo. , on monday . " the law that we signed in massachusetts was a combination of efforts both on the part of those that were for additional gun rights and those that opposed gun rights , and they came together and made some changes that provided , i think , a better environment for both , and that 's why both sides came to celebrate the signing of the bill , " he said . " where there are opportunities for people of reasonable minds to come together and find common ground , that 's the kind of legislation i like . the idea of one party jamming through something over the other tends to divide the nation , not make us a more safe and prosperous place . " elsewhere on your monday dial , as per politico : mitt romney on gun control : " i still believe that the second amendment is the right course to preserve and defend and do n't believe that new laws are going to make a difference in this type of tragedy . " lindsey graham on sandy 's gun violence : " it 's a matter of time , but i 'm not going to have that kind of conversation . " romney on romney 's handling of guns : " we 've got a lot of people who 've been told that they 're going to get a gun out of their guns . " mitt romney , on the other hand , called the bill a " farce " and " baseless " and said it would " reach out to others in their community
