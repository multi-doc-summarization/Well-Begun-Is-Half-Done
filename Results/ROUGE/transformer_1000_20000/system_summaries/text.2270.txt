jason alexander says he was " so mad at myself for retelling this story in any way that diminish her , " but he did n't have any regrets about it . " yesterday on @ sternshow , i retold a story i had told years ago about my personal difficulties and playing george against the susan that character and i was always concerned that it was n't working , " he said , per the new york daily news . " and again i say , i and the cast really liked and like heidi . she is a kind , lovely person who undoubtedly worked really hard to create susan and that no one wanted to kill heidi . " he added that he was n't sure how married he was , but that " i did n't want to put the burden of the character on swedberg , " and that he " did n't really think george married but all the alternatives seemed predictable . they were always looking for an inventive end to the engagement . so when the comment was made about 'killing ' , no one was talking about the character . and that made a creative light bulb go off apparently , " writes alexander <unk> at the daily beast . he adds that alexander " did not have that or more security in my own work , i surely would have killed me as it was all playing exactly as they wanted . "
