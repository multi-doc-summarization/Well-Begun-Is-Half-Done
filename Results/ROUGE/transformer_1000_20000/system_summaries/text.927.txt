a high school student who wore an eagle for four years wore feathers to the school 's graduation cap was denied a $ 1,000 fine for wearing the feather . " i feel like this wasn â€™ t fair . it felt like it was n't legal , " says ramer ramer , a student at poarch creek band of indians in alabama . the school , which has been looking forward to wearing that eagle feather on a necklace , says it is investigating the contract , which would require students to participate in graduation , reports the washington post . ramer , who was nervous on the diploma , says she was told to sign the diploma or disciplinary actions were taken and that she was n't allowed to speak with her . she says she did n't wear a feather at all , but that she did not face any disciplinary actions . " it really did hurt my feelings . i have watched others wear it and i looked forward to it my whole four years there . now when it was my turn , " she says , per the new york daily news . " they did n't say anything , but you could tell the staff and the other two did . " ramer says he was told the school would not get their diplomas due to the " extraneous items during graduation , " and that he was informed that she would pull off the field . " i never signed that paper , " he says , adding that the contract was " ridiculous . " the school says the decision was made after students paid a fee to pay for it , and that 's not the case .
