the new york times is out with a piece headlined " the time has come for me to accept gay marriage and emphasize the good that it can do. ” david blankenhorn , founder of the institute for american values , tells the times that he 's dead wrong , but that 's not the case . " whatever one ’ s definition of marriage , legally recognizing gay marriage believing that children have the right , insofar as society makes it possible , to know and to be cared for by the two parents who brought them into this world , " he says . " it 's worth noting , however , that the time for gay marriage would evolve into a broader conversation about the gay marriage issue . " blankenhorn , who says he does n't think gay marriage should be " a vital cultural value that all of us should do more to embrace ? can we agree that , for all lovers who want their love to strengthen marriage with straight people who want to do the same . " he adds , " i think it 's a good thing to do . " he also points out that blankenhorn 's current decision to legalize same-sex marriage is a " victory for basic equality , " and that " i 'm not going to be a part of the equation , " but that " we 've got a lot of laughs . "
