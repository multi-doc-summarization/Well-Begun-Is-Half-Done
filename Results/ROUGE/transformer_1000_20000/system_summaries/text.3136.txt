if you 're looking for a woman , you 're not going to be able to get pregnant . a new book by cara paiuk finds that the best things to do is make for your fertility , and it 's a " wonderful reminder that judaism is pleasantly focused on how we live , rather than what happens after we do , " per the washington post . " a woman 's right to sexual satisfaction is detailed in her ketubah , her marriage , independent of pregnancy. . " she adds that she 's not sure why she 's pregnant , but she 's still trying to do so . " it 's all good , it 's kosher , " she says , adding that she does n't think she 's going to convert to the intimate workings of the reproductive system . " i do n't think it 's time to do that , but i do think that 's what it 's going on . " the book , published in the new york times , calls it " one of the most fertile time in the world , " noting that it 's " not the only celeb who knows a thing or two about a thing . " but it does n't seem to be a two-way street , either : " it ’ s not a good jew , you see , ' " she writes , noting that " you ’ re going to have a lot of people who don ’ t know what they ’ re talking about . " ( meanwhile , the book is getting rave reviews . )
