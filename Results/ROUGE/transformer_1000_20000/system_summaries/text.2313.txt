the largest living fish fish , whale sharks , and tuna have been found in the western coast of europe , and scientists say they 've found a way to pinpoint the source of whale shark occurrences . the researchers say the shark , which is known as 'pintados ' portuguese , is a titan part of the azores , nine miles southwest of portugal , the guardian reports . " they know that a whale shark will almost always carry a school of tuna underneath it , " says a researcher at the azores . " it 's a mystery as to why why whale sharks are dying . " the study , published in the journal nature communications , found that whale sharks prefer warm tropical waters off the azores islands . the sharks are known to reach up to 41.5 feet in length and 47,000 miles away from sea surface temperatures . the sharks ' teeth were found in a pond near the site of the isles in the central north atlantic city . the shark was found to have been in the water for about a year , but it 's not clear if the sharks were on the way to shore up the gill sauce . the shark 's lead author , pedro afonso , says he 's " shocked and surprised " by the findings . he says that while the shark population does n't appear to be responsible for the sharks , it does n't have to worry about whale occurrences .
