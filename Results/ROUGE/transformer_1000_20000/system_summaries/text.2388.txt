" the new york times reports that the rules were proposed in july 2016 , when the state 's health services department said it would require all medical facilities to cremate or bury fetal remains . the rules , which would allow abortion providers to obtain abortions , would require a " pro-choice " rules , meaning that the remains would be allowed for other body parts or organs . " the rules target physicians that care for patients for no reason other than to make it harder to get a safe legal abortion in texas , " a legislative counsel for naral tells the dallas morning news . " it creates an undue burden on women who either have an abortion or a miscarriage , " he says . " they 're taking away our rights to own our own bodily fluids and products . " but the rules are n't binding , and a public-health assessment is expected to be put in place next year . " the methods described in the new rules may have a cost , that cost [ premiums ] to be offset by costs currently being spent by facilities on transportation , storage , and other drugs , " the department says . the rules would require " pro-choice rules , " and a rep says the rules will be " complicated , " per the times .
