president trump hailed the start of his southern border wall this past week , saying that " we 're going to be starting work , literally , on monday , on not only some new wall -- not enough , but we 're working that very quickly . the photos showed the continuation of an old project to replace 2 miles of existing barrier . " trump and his officials departed from reality on a variety of subjects in recent days : the census , amazon 's practices and the makeup of the supreme court , the ap reports . " increased its parcel would rise by $ 5.8 billion , " says the acting deputy commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection . " amazon must pay real costs ( and taxes ) now ! " trump , speaking the previous week after signing a bill financing the government , tweeted that it had " no new work got underway " and that it was " a scam . " the washington post reports that the post office of the postal service , which began feb. 21 , says it had been going on for more than a month to replace a little more than 2 miles from the border wall . it 's unclear how many of the photos will be released , but the new york times reports that it 's not clear whether the post will be able to obtain a copy of the project .
