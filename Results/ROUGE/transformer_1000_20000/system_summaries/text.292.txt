president trump on friday tweeted that he is " sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard . must be proactive ! " the guardian reports that the tweet was posted online friday morning , and it was n't the first time trump 's tweet came to light . " i never think it ’ s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation , " he wrote . " as i ’ ve just said , the police and security services are working to discover the full circumstances of this cowardly attack and to identify all those responsible. . " the bbc notes that trump 's tweets were n't exactly the same , but screenshots of the tweets were from the white house and the guardian . " these are sick and depraved people , " trump tweeted . " must be dealt with in a much tougher manner . " he added : " for years , scotland yard has been a leader . so i think if there was a terrorist attack here , god forbid , that we would say that they were in scotland yard to undermine the trust of the people .
