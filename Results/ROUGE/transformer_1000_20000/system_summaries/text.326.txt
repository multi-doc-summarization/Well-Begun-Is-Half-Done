" it 's the first time the book has been released , but it does n't look like it will be a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , exquisite <unk> , and <unk> . " " there 's a lot of room for improvement , but there 's no need to be done , " says owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly . " it â€™ s a great read . "
