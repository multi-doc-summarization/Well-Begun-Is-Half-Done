president trump escalated his attacks on attorney general jeff sessions monday , suggesting the department of justice put republicans in midterm jeopardy with recent indictments . " two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time , " he said . " good job jeff sessions ... " he added , referring to the first two republicans to endorse him in the midterm elections . the indictment into collins lays out behavior from 2017 through the jeff justice department , which is supposed to do his personal and political bidding . still , investigators are never supposed to take into account the specifics of the charges , did not name the republicans . but the charges have raised democratic hopes . a spokeswoman for sessions declined comment . the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment . trump did not have any public events monday , but he was also under investigation by congressional ethics officials . both were indicted on separate charges last month : rep. duncan hunter of california on charges that included spending campaign funds for personal expenses and rep. chris collins of new york on insider trading . he has not exited his race , while collins ended his re-election bid days after his indictment . both seats appear likely to remain in gop hands , but the new york times reports that sessions has boiled over to president trump .
