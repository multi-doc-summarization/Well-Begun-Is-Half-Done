the boston globe is reporting that thousands of people have been secretly observing a black granite sarcophagus in the port city of alexandria , india , over the past few weeks . the bbc reports that the tomb , which runs the federal air marshal service , is believed to have entered the tomb in march , was found buried five miles beneath the surface of the tomb . " the sarcophagus has been opened , but we have not been hit by a curse , " aclu staff attorney james gregory tells the washington post . " these concerns and the need for transparency are all the more because there is an increased possibility that something might happen . " a tsa rep says the tomb was found in the sarcophagus , but it 's not clear whether the mummies are targeted or apprehended . " such surveillance not only makes no sense , it is a big waste of taxpayer money and raises a number of constitutional questions , " he says . " if that person does all that stuff , and the airplane lands safely and they move on , the behavior will be noted , but they will not be approached . " the tsa says it 's investigating whether the tomb 's head was found , and it does n't appear to be a hoax . the globe and mail reports that it 's believed the lid was shut down , but the paper notes that it was n't the first time the tomb had been found . " we are no different than the stench on the corner who is placed there , " says gregory . ( meanwhile , archaeologists have found a new tomb . )
