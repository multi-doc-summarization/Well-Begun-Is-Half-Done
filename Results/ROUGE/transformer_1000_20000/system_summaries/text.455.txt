scientists have found a correlation between the eruption of mount st. helens ' eruption of 1980 , and they 've figured out how to explain why it was n't a pyroclastic flow . the new york times reports researchers at the university of exeter found that the <unk> caldera from the lithics are basaltic and granitic , 18 miles from where the eruption occurred . " it 's not consistent with what we found , " lead researcher olivier roche says in a press release . " the magma is very much larger than it is . " the study , published in astrobiology , calls the eruption " a very significant event . " scientists say the eruption could be a " tipping point " for the volcano 's " core " of the caldera from ignimbrite to <unk> degrees fahrenheit . it 's possible that the eruption would have been catastrophic , but scientists say it could be the first time the eruption happened in the area . " it was very evident that there was a lot of chatter about the eruption , but there was no one in the volcano that had been inhabited to the ground , " roche says , adding that the study 's lead researcher studied the possibility of the eruption to occur . " it is very difficult to tell the difference between the two species , and it 's a matter of time . " roche adds the team is working to figure out how the eruption came to light . " we have a lot more energy to do , but we do n't know how it is going to happen , " he says . " we do know how to swim to the volcano . "
