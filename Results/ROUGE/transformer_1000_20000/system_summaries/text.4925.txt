the pierce county sheriff 's office is investigating the death of susan powell , who was arrested in 2011 after a search of his home turned up " thousands of images of females being photographed without their knowledge , including susan powell and many minors . " no deal has been proposed , " pierce county prosecutor mark lindquist tells kiro fm . " we are not offering any deal but if information is brought forward we would listen . " he adds that " you have to weigh what 's best for everybody involved in the case and if that works out , that would be great , " per kiro . " but i would not have everybody put their hopes on it because i 've had enough dealings with steve to know that he 's playing a game and he might jerk everybody around for a couple years and enjoy doing it . not that we would n't try , but not that he 'd be cooperative . " powell 's attorney or utah law enforcement " proposes something " in exchange for information about her whereabouts , " lindquist says , adding that powell " did n't want to get involved with pierce county 's criminal case , " adding , " there should be things that he [ steven powell ] would probably like to talk to us about we hope , " nielson adds , per the salt lake tribune . " sure we ca n't prosecute those josh , but did somebody know anything ? did somebody help him ... we need to resolve this . "
