a new study out of the university of new york suggests that a poison produced by common germs could be a trigger for the autoimmune disorder caused by food poisoning , reports the guardian . researchers say the toxin , called perfringens , is responsible for a million cases of food poisoning in the us each year , but it 's too early to suggest that the cells are targeted in ms . " what we â€™ ve shown is the target the cells that <unk> the nerves in the spinal cord , " says lead researcher jennifer linden . " to me , if you were going to design a trigger . this would really fit the mold really well , " she says . " it 's the epsilon , one of 12 toxins produced by c. perfringens . " the study , published tuesday in plos one , found that about 13 % of a small sample of food products contained c. perfringens bacteria , and nearly 3 % were positive for the toxin linked to it . the bbb says it is investigating the strain , which can cause blindness and blindness . the researchers say it 's possible that the toxin 's ability to die in the central nervous system could be involved in the disease . the study 's lead author tells the new york times that the findings suggest that ms and other ms cells have been exposed to the same strain of clostridium perfringens , a type of cancer that affects the brain 's brain . ( another study found that those who have lesions on their skin are more likely to die prematurely . )
