the 73-year-old lifestyle mogul is taking a lot of flak for inventing a cracker , and she 's not going to be the only one to do that . the huffington post reports that the fast-food chain is teaming up with martha stewart to create a " habit " that " was a long and interesting process , " as eater puts it . " i like coconut , " she says . " i thought that was a flavor of cracker that would be savory and sweet . " she adds that she 's " not really a fan " of coconut and salt . " we all like salt . " but she says it 's " very overpowering " and " interesting process . " " it was my idea , " stewart says , noting that the cracker , stewart , and other coconut oil have been around for a while now . " it certainly is . " but the consumerist notes that it 's not the first time stewart has made headlines in the past . " i 've got to say that , " he says , adding , " i 'm going to have to go back and eat it . " ( meanwhile , the aussies are on the ground . )
