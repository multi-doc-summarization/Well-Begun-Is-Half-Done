president obama 's decision to slash oil prices is n't exactly a surprise , but the white house is n't happy about it . " the american people aren ’ t stupid , " obama said in a statement , per the new york times . " it ’ s not going to set the price of gas . " he added , " i ’ ve got to pay for it . i ’ d like to pay a fee . i ’ m going to pay $ 200,000 . i don ’ t believe it . i ’ ll say that ’ s what i ’ re talking about . " the president 's stance on oil and gas prices is a worsening economic crisis in the middle of the year , and the obama administration has said that the oil pipeline would be a " disaster , " reports the washington post , which notes that the us has a " favorable view " of the oil industry , which has been lobbying for more than a decade . " these increases have occurred in spite of his restrictive policies . they are the result of clinton- and permitting , " he said , adding that the federal government will " continue using less carbon than any pipeline in the future .
