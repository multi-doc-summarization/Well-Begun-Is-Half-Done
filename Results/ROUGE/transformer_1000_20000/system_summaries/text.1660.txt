scientists have found a correlation between the cuckoo and the baby birds , but they 've found a way to do so . researchers at the university of utah found that the parasitic nest fly in the 1960s leaned over the edge of the evolutionary tree known as the medium ground , reports nature world news . " this is like a really bad horror flick , " says lead researcher dale clayton . " the finches can â€™ t withstand one night with these parasites. . " the team found the eggs , which are believed to be the most accessible species in the world , reports the new york times . it 's not clear whether the birds were to run into a series of bad behavior , but the researchers say they have no idea why the birds are genetically disruptive to the species , which is why they are n't genetically modifying the eggs . in fact , the birds tend to be susceptible to peanut allergies , and they tend to have a lot more time to eat , reports science daily . the eggs are often used to kill mosquitoes , and the egg finch does n't appear to have been a calming influence . the researchers suggest that the coloration could be gone within the next century , and that 's why they 're not so sure . " we have a very good idea of how the baby is going to be , " darwin says .
