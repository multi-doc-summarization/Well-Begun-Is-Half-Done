the first comet with ocean-like water has been found in the earth 's oceans , according to a study published wednesday in nature . the comet , which is believed to have been thirsty for a early earth , was found to have originated from comets , the bbc reports . " it was a big surprise when we saw the ratio was almost the same as what we find in the oceans , " the lead researcher tells reuters . " it means it is not true any more that a maximum of 10 % of water could have come from comets . " the study 's lead author says the comet 's fingerprints " did not extend much beyond jupiter 's orbit . " the comet has a near identical " d/h " ratio to seawater , which has been linked to asteroids and comets . researchers say they 've found a correlation between the water 's oceans and comets . " we have a lot to say , " geochemist alyson hartogh says in a press release . he says the findings are " very exciting . " the bbc notes that the discovery of the comet is still being debated by scientists who say it 's possible the comet will have evaporated and that the water could be used to be used in the solar system .
