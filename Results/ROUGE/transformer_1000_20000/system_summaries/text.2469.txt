a new study in the journal of biodemography and social biology finds that babies born to mothers in their twenties are more likely to be in stable relationships , reports the guardian . researchers at the london school of economics analyzed data from 18,000 children for an extended period of time , and found that those born to women in their 30s tended to be less likely than younger mothers to play with their kids . the study also found that women who had a higher risk of obesity had a lower cognitive rate than those who had n't had kids in the twenties . the study looked at 18,000 children between the ages of 18 and 81 , and the lead researcher tells the times that the findings are " not surprising , " and that " first-time mothers have higher incomes , for example , are more educated and less productive , " he says . the study , published in pnas , found that the number of women who scored the highest cognitive scores , outperforming , <unk> , and <unk> women were less likely to smoke less than mothers . the authors say the findings could be applied to the lse , but they do n't necessarily have a correlation between the mother 's age and the fact that it 's not necessarily applicable to the mother , the telegraph reports . the researchers say that while the study does n't support the idea , it does n't seem to support the notion that women born in their 20s have more lifestyles . ( meanwhile , the pope 's team is trying to solve the mystery . )
