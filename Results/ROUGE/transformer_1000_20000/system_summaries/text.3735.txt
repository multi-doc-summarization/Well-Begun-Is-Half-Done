eating competitively is his job , and when he 's stuffing his face on stage , he 's picky about how his pork product is . " i do n't feel that bad . i 'm used to 10 or 12 pounds of food , " he tells weird news after the feat . " but i love bacon , it goes with everything . " he says he 'll never lose his craving for the behemoth . " just as bacon hits its prime on the world stage , so has its champion . it needs to be cooked perfectly . it ca n't be too crispy and if it 's not warm when i get it , the fat coagulates into lard . " i feel the texture , i taste the saltiness , and i focus on getting it all down , " stonie tells huffpost . he says the bacon was cooked just the way i like it . " it was n't immediately clear whether chestnut would try to pilfer the bar high today , but he says it was a " little crispy " because it was his day , and that he had n't sponsored a true bacon-eating contest , which he says was the result of the two waste no time in eating each other 's bacon . " i 'm eating 10 or 15 <unk> minute , where i 've never seen a single pig , " says stonie , who has a history of eating a lot more than 28,000 milligrams of sodium per day , per huffpost . the new baron of breakfast did n't have much competition , but stonie says it 's time for chestnut to make it easier for him to do so .
