chely wright , the lgbt activist who has married girlfriend lauren just a year after she came out about being a lesbian , is now the subject of a new interview with the los angeles times : " you get good money from jim beam to put that emblem on the side of your bus . i was on the crown royal tour , and i have to say it was one of my favorite tours . they would rather you were a drug addict than be gay . they will forgive you if you beat your wife , lose your kids to state , get six divorces , make a sex tape , get labeled as a tramp and all of it is better than being gay , " wright says in a blog post , adding that she 's " thrilled " about the confession . " it 's like my friends who are in the know , which are not many , and my family members who know , <unk> is n't all of them , " she says . " i feel like i 'm floating . " she adds that she " did n't help my career , " but she 's not the only one to have the photos taken in the past : " i 've never seen anything like this before , but i 've been so shocked to see it again .
