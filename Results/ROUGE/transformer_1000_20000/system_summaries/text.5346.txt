edward snowden 's revelations about the nsa 's collection of telephone and internet data suggest that the nsa is trying to figure out how much the nsa could do , reports the new york times . " the government has granted itself power it is not entitled to . there is no public oversight . the result is people like myself have the latitude to go further than they are allowed to , " he said , according to the guardian . but the gist of the story is that the guardian is that it 's not clear whether the nsa will be prosecuted for the leak , but it 's still unclear whether it will be able to obtain any information on the nsa . in fact , the obama administration is looking into the possibility that the fbi is collecting data on the data , and it 's going to be a " big part of any case , " says a spokesman for the white house , who says the ig 's office is " looking forward to this . " the guardian , meanwhile , reports that hong kong is the first major tech hub in the history of the nsa spying revelations .
