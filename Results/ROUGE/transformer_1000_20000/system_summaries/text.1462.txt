" it 's just not panning out to be the storm we 'd thought it would be , " he said . " quite a wet blanket for members of the washington , dc , area . " the storm was dumping plenty of snow in other parts of the state , and the ap notes that the storm is expected to hit the northern coast of the mississippi river today , with more than 10 inches of snow for washington . the ap reports that the national weather service says it will be closed as the nation 's capital continues to claw back to the ground . the national guard says that while the storm 's winds are forecast to devastate neighborhoods , there 's still no danger of flooding in the area , and that 's not enough to be enough inland to get people out of the streets . " we 're going to get a lot of people out there , " says a meteorologist .
