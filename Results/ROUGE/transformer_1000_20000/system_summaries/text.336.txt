the new orleans oil spill is getting a lot more complicated than the spill itself . the new york times reports that the federal government has allocated $ 20 billion for the cleanup , which was run by british oil company bp , and the epa says it will decide whether to overturn the ban . the ap reports that federal agencies have been trying to figure out how to fix the problem , but the ap says that 's not the case . " it 's not going to happen , " says a justice department spokesperson . " this is an unprecedented industrywide shutdown . never before has the government done this , ‚Äù says a spokesman for the sierra club , which is investigating whether the rig killed 11 people in the gulf of mexico . the ap has a roundup of reactions to the ban : president obama : " we will not allow the industry to go back to work tomorrow without an arbitrary time limit , " he said . " it will be hard to overstate the importance of securing funding to the gulf . " he added that the ban will be lifted in the wake of the oil spill , but that does n't mean it wo n't happen again .
