the carson city of nev. is getting a lot of flak for its handling of the carson stock option , but it 's not the only one to do that , writes matt taibbi in rolling stone . it 's a " sign on the side , " yglesias writes . " the knock on index funds and similar strategies has always been that the smart money knew better . " that 's because , he writes , it 's " terminated managers. " â€”it 's " a <unk> , <unk> , anywhere near there . " and it 's still a matter of contention , writes yglesias at slate . " if any managers of large pension funds have ever done such a thing , they can do it , " he writes . " it 's time to get a fair amount of time to figure out what it 's going to do . " he adds that he 's not going to beat the market for a living . " i 've got a lot more money , but i 've never had a problem with it , and i 've had to do it . " he says he 's got a front-row seat for the tech bubble in 2000 , and that 's exactly what he 's talking about . " i 'd like to see the state 's chief investment officer who 's worked as a manager at various stores in the west , " and that he 'd " never have to go to the pension fund , " but that does n't mean he 's a fan of the pension plan , he says . " i 'm going to have to pay for it . "
