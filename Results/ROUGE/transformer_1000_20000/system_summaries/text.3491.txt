the white house says it 's investigating the identities of president trump 's advisers , susan rice , and former national security adviser susan rice . the new york times reports that the president 's transition team caught up in a national security council review of the government 's policy on " unmasking " identities of individuals in the us who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping , but the sources say it 's not clear how rice knew to ask for the names to be unmasked . " i know nothing about this , " rice said in a statement . " i was surprised to see reports from the chairman of the house intelligence committee . " the sources tell fox news that the names of rice and rice were part of the transition team , which was tasked with interviewing trump staffers . the sources also say the names were redacted from rice , who was the senior national security correspondent for the daily beast , and the washington post 's sources say the report was " befuddled by revelations that the former white house national security committee chair had been briefed on the report . " it 's a matter of time , " one source says . " the fact that it was not disclosed to the fbi is that the information was leaked to the media , and it was n't disclosed . "
