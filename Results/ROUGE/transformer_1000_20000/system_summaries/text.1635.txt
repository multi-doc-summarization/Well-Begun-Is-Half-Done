" i want to let her know i did not know about weinstein 's crimes , not in the ‘ 90s when he attacked her , or through subsequent decades when he proceeded to attack others , " an apparent reference to weinstein 's alleged sexual abuse of women over the course of decades , per the los angeles times . " i don ’ t approve of rape . i didn ’ t know . " the posters went up near streep 's house in pasadena , calif. , near the sag-aftra building in mid-wilshire and across from the 20th century fox studio lot in century city . the posters also showed up in several other places , including an image of streep next to weinstein with a red strip across her face with the text " she knew , " the new york daily news reports . the posters are a riff on the work of artist barbara kruger , whose signature text in red has been shared more than 1.6 million times since the sun came up with the # sheknew hashtag # sheknew , which stars streep and tom hanks as " the harvey weinstein scandal .
