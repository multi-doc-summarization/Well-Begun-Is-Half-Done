the coast guard is trying to figure out how to leak off the oil and gas pedal to the gulf oil spill , but it 's not clear whether the leak will be returned , reports the new york times . taylor energy , a coast guard spokesman , says the leak is " ridiculous " and " reeks of desperation , " reports the washington post , which notes that the epa is investigating the leak . the company says it will be fined up to $ 40,000 per day for failing to pay for the leak , but the new method of containment must eliminate the surface sheen and avoid the deficiencies associated with prior containment systems . the leak comes after a federal coast guard issued a warning to the federal government about the leak . " the new information comes from a federal investigation , " says an epa official . " this is not the first time this has happened . " taylor , meanwhile , says he has no regrets that the leak was flawed , but he says it 's still working to fix the problem . " it 's very hard to overstate how much it 's going to happen , " he says .
