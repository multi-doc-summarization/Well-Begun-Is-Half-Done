the southern district of west virginia has filed a chapter alleging that the leaky storage tank appears to have been pierced through its base by some sort of object , the ap reports . the company says it has at least 200 creditors and owes its top 20 creditors $ 3.66 million . the bankruptcy document states that a chemical used to clean coal leaked from a storage tank and then a containment area at a facility owned by freedom industries . the water ran into the elk river , contaminating the state 's largest water system . it 's not clear what caused the spill , but state officials say a current theory for the hole is that it broke near the storage tank in the cold days before the spill . " it ’ s just a local water line , " says a state department spokeswoman . " we don ’ t have a problem with it . " the petition , which lists the company 's assets and liabilities as range from $ 1 million to $ 10 million , was tainted after the spill was lifted . the bankruptcy filing also states that the water restrictions have not been inspected by state regulators since 2001 .
