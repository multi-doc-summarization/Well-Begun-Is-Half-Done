the new york republican and former mayor of san francisco says he 's " very surprised and very resolute to do something about it . " that 's the conclusion that congress has demanded a full investigation into what happened , reports politico . " this is absolutely inexcusable , " he says . " these teams need to set an example for the rest of society . the nfl is a great league … but there has to be a strength in the league , and they have to project the values of what ’ s going on to make sure it never happens again . " king , who sits on the house homeland security committee , says the committee will decide whether to hold hearings on the breach . " i think very strongly that if a player is arrested , he should be suspended , and if they ’ re convicted , that ends it . i don ’ t know there are contracts . this has gone on too long , and this is getting too bad , " says king , whose son died in a car crash in march . " i ’ ve never seen the glory days . "
