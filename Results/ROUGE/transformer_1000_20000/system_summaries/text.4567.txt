donald trump says he 's " things that other people don â€™ t know , and so [ intelligence officials ] can have hacked " the emails of hillary clinton 's campaign chairman john podesta . " very strange ! it was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies ' unanimous conclusion , " trump tweeted wednesday , per nbc news . " also [ assange ] said russians did not give him the info ! " the new york times reports that trump 's tweets came after assange once again claimed that russia was not the source of podesta 's stolen emails . " the intelligence experts both inside and outside the government say evidence suggests russia had tried to influence the election , " the washington post quotes trump as saying . " he called the alleged delay " and " a 14-year-old kid could have hacked podesta . " trump , who has previously expressed support for the hacking campaign , said tuesday that he was " not the russian government and it is not a state party " and that he " knows things that happen . " the guardian reports that the obama administration is investigating the hack , which the ap notes is " nearly impossible to know who hacked what and when . "
