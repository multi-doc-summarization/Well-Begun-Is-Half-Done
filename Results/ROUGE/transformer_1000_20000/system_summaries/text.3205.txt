pope francis is n't exactly overflowing with criticism over the pope 's decision to gay marriage , but he 's not happy about it . " we have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety , " he told italian daily corriere della sera . " states , for instance , justify civil unions as a way to provide rights like access to health care . " he added that the pope " did not choose to enter into debates about the delicate matter of gay civil unions , " and that he does n't think the pope will be " offensive . " the vatican has n't commented on the controversy , but it 's not clear whether the pontiff will be able to read more into the pope . in a wide-ranging interview , the vatican said that " marriage is between a man and a woman . however , he said the obligation of the state to fulfill its responsibilities towards its citizens . " in a statement , pope benedict said that the church is " the first time a pope has indicated even tentative " acceptance of civil unions . " the pontiff , speaking on the topic of his election with commemorative stamps and a dvd with footage of the pope , is expected to be released tomorrow .
