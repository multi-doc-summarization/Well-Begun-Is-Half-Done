hawaii lawmaker clayton hee and honolulu police have agreed to get rid of a longtime exemption that allowed officers to have sex with prostitutes , the ap reports . according to the ap , the bill passed the house without a clause stating that officers have never been allowed to have the language removed . " i suppose that in retrospect the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation , " hee says . " but , thankfully , the issue has been brought to light and the behavior has been addressed . " the house judiciary committee says it is investigating the exemption , but it 's not clear whether the exemption will apply to any member of a police department . " they agree this tool is not an appropriate tool for their toolbox , " bell says in a statement , per the ap . " that 's exactly what we wanted and how we 've been conducting our investigations . with the verbal offer , " he says . the bill was too vague , but police say it does n't know of any cases in recent memory in which an officer was disciplined for having sexual contact with a prostitute . but the police support the idea that sexual penetration and oral sex in the course of an investigation is ongoing .
