kaiser permanente in san francisco has been giving the drug to its patients for more than two years , and now a new study finds that the truvada city is 100 % effective in more than 90 % of its patients , reports the los angeles times . " it 's wonderful to have less worries about hiv . it 's something that is always lurking in the back of one 's mind , " says the study 's lead author . the study , published wednesday in the journal pediatrics , found that the drug has been approved by the food and drug administration since 2012 . the study found that truvada , which has been linked to hiv and asthma , had been published outside the tightly regulated clinical trial setting in 2012 , per the times . the researchers say the study is " very close to being managed to find a correlation between hiv and diabetes , " though they warn that the study does n't necessarily establish causation . " we have options , we have tools that we can use , " one researcher says , adding that while the truvada company does n't have enough evidence to do so , it does n't seem to be the case . " we do n't know what it 's going to do , " he says , noting that it 's not clear how many people who 've been on the truvada site have been affected by the drug , but that does n't mean there 's a lot of people who want to get infected with hiv . ( meanwhile , the truvada pill may be getting a lot more attention . )
