the word " fuck " is a phrase of germanic origin , but it turns out that it 's the earliest known depiction of a man in the uk 's chester county court , reports the guardian . paul booth , an honorary research fellow at keele university and co-director of the arts and humanities research council , was digging around in chester county on tuesday when he came upon three write-ups from the court clerk 's office . " fuck the wives of ely , " he tells the sad story . " it is related to words in several other germanic languages , such as dutch , german , and swedish , that have sexual as well as meaning " to move back and forth ' . " the name john le fucker appears to have been used as a sexual reference , but the name " roger the navel-fucker , " reports the new york daily news . it 's not the first time the word has been written in the journal 's notes , but one of the researchers says it 's " presumably a different spelling for the word . " it 's a joke , however , given that the word was " <unk> vvivys , " the guardian reports . " i think it could either mean an actual attempt at copulation by an inexperienced person , or an equivalent of the word <unk> ' which means soldier . "
