miley cyrus is releasing new album , ca n't be told what she should sing about . " i 'm not trying to be like , go to the club and get a bunch of guys ... what i 'm trying to do is to make a point with my record and look consistent , in the way my record sounds and the way i dress , " cyrus said in a recent interview . " i feel more comfortable dressing with a little less , which is just how i 've always been , " she added . " now i 'm able to do that a little more freely and , also , i 've just grown up to be this way too . it 's not like this was me five years ago . " the ap notes that the video was posted to youtube last week , and it has since been shared more than 19,000 times . the ap reports that the 17-year-old has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past year , and the ap says it has been " teasing the problems " for years . " i 've done that but that 's not my schtick . i 'm really comfortable with my body , i work really hard to be fit and to know that i can wear whatever makes me most comfortable . "
