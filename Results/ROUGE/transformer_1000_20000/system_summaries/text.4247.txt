puerto rico is on the verge of making landfall in the wake of hurricane maria , but it 's not clear how much latitude it will be , reports the new york times . the faa says it 's looking into the possibility that puerto rico 's balloons will be accessed , and the ap reports that the launch is expected to take place in the next few days . " we 're grateful for the support of at & t and the many other partners and organizations that have made this possible , " says a fema official . " we are now learning how best to do this . " the map , which provides a snapshot of what 's happening in puerto rico and puerto rico on friday , is the first time the launch has been made , notes the washington post . " we 've never deployed our new machine learning algorithms to keep the balloons over areas where it 's needed for a long period of time , and we 'll be able to get them back to puerto rico from our site in the future . " the launch of the project will be a big step toward the end of the year , and it will take a long time to get the launch done .
