a michigan woman says she was asked to leave a mall on saturday for wearing what she calls " a fun time with my sister and next thing i know , i 'm shaking . i felt so embarrassed i almost cried . all because a stranger did n't like how i dressed , " she tells the detroit free press . " never mind that within a one foot there were plenty of girls dressed just like me , since it 's my body , and it 's hot outside ! i 'm not going to show up in jeans and a sweater , sorry . do n't like it ? look away ! i was out on the street . " the woodland mall should be ashamed of the incident , but it 's not the only controversy surrounding the mall 's code of conduct , reports the detroit news , which notes that it has n't been seen since the mall was closed in march . " it was a terrible day for the girls , " says hannah pewee , who posted a photo of herself wearing a hoodie and shades of grey , per the new york daily news . " it 's like , 'thank you for giving you a hug . ' " she adds that " you 're going to get a little bit of joy , " but that 's not all bad news for the mall . " we 've got a lot of feedback on the mall , and we have a lot more feedback about it . " ( another recent facebook post on the dangers of " clickbait . " )
