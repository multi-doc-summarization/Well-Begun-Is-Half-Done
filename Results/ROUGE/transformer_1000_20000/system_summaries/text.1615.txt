" it 's time to say that it 's not going to happen . " the big question : whether christie scored just 1 percentage point higher in any of the four polls , they would have made it onto the debate , but that 's not the case , writes maggie haberman at politico . " if either fox business did n't release which it would use in advance , then the debate was over , " he writes . " it was n't a matter of time , but it was a great night . " the debate " will be a bit more complicated , " observes maggie haberman for politico . " but the focus is squarely on the deficit , " she writes . " the question is how much the debate will be .
