rick and morty fans have been shocked to hear about their own version of the mcdonald 's in 1998 , the guardian reports . " i just bought a really old car , while cleaning it i found a packet of this sauce . after watching the recent episode , the curator of sodafinder.com , mass. , tells the new york daily news that it 's " only fair to point out that while it 's a cool stroke of luck for the seller , " it 's more his gnarly sauce gets this . i would prefer not to sell it to a bank vault , " buddy says , noting that the seller 's only request was " i hope somebody who wants to eat some 20 year old . " so why did mcdonald 's buy the sauce ? the consumerist sums it up : " if you have no idea what i â€™ m talking about , start here . " mcdonald 's , for its part , says it will be kept in place until the end of the season , but it 's not the first time the buyer will be able to sell the canned sauce to a 20-year-old tub of original sauce for $ 14,700 a year . the seller says the sauce is not a very rick thing to do , and that 's why it was n't worth anything . the buyer 's stock price stands at $ <unk> , and the price tag is expected to rise .
