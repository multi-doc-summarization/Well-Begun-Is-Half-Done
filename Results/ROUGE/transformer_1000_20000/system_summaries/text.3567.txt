elton john 's album goodbye yellow road released 40 years ago , and it 's not the first time he 's ever seen , the ap reports . " i cried a little at it , because it reminded me of a time when i was very innocent , " he said . " but we will do it and it will be a joyous occasion and we will have our civil partnership . we 're not going to bother to get married . " he added that he 's " very proud of britain and the laws that we 've seen come into existence since we 've been together . " " i do n't blame anybody or anything . it was just me being inquisitive . ... i 'll be part of the gang , " john continued . " i think that 's what i do . " he also said he 'd spoken to lauer about the record in anticipation of doing interviews with him , and he 's not sure what he 'll do . " i 've never seen anything like this , but i 've had a lot to do with it , and i think it 's time to do it . " but he did n't agree with john , who has n't spoken about his upcoming nuptials . " we 'll never just say , 'oh , elijah , 1 . ' "
