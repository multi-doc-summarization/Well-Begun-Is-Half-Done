facebook is tweaking its algorithms to make a " dislike " button next to facebook 's users , reports cnbc . the company says it 's " very close to shipping a test of it , " but it does n't want people to go through the process . " we do n't want to turn facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people 's posts , " facebook ceo mark zuckerberg said in a press release . " it 's kind of obvious that this cycle happens : there 's a natural impulse to want users to harass or disrespect other people , and it 's apparently going to head into testing soon . " he added that the button is " a dislike " for facebook , and that it would n't be easy for users to opt out of the process . " i think it 's time to get to say we are working on it and are very close , " he said . " i 'm not going to do that . " but the company has n't commented on the controversy . " i 've always had a change of heart , " says zuckerberg . " i do n't know what it is , but i do know it 's not a good idea . "
