" the probe is expected to take a closer look at the speed of the landing zone , and it 's possible that the lander will be able to hover over the edge of the patch , reports space.com . " we have n't seen anything like this before , " a nasa astronomer says . " we 've never seen a lot of data . " the esa says it 's looking into the possibility of a parachute that could be used to predict the impact of the probe , but it has n't been able to figure out how the lander 's orbit will be .
