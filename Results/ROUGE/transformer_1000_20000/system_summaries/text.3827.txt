german chancellor angela merkel says she 's " everything " to save the euro and end europe 's sovereign debt crisis , but the country is n't happy about it . " the path to overcoming this won â€™ t be without setbacks but at the end of the year at least one country ( and probably more ) will be the year when the euro starts to break up , " she said in a statement . " it is not a done deal yet . we are only forecasting a 60 % probability . " the new york times , meanwhile , reports that the euro has increased to 99 % over the past two years . " it now looks as though 2012 will <unk> our forecast , " the head of economics and business research says . " this will only succeed if europe learns from the mistakes of the spanish and italian governments . " the guardian reports that merkel 's new year 's losses against the u.s. dollar , which is expected to continue in march , will likely take weeks to hammer out a longer-term deal that would allow greece to buy time for the bailout .
