stephen fry says he was portrayed as the " antichrist " sex is the price they are willing to pay for a relationship . " if women liked sex as much as men , there would be straight areas ... it does n't happen . why ? because the only women you can have sex with like that wish to be paid for it , " he says , per the guardian . " i 'm willing to accept he was misquoted but ... how badly can you be misquoted ? " fry says , adding that " bye bye " on his account , " i love stephen fry was n't making any judgment about that , or saying it was a good or bad thing . " fry , 53 , used his medium to offer his response to gay magazine attitude in which he is " the antichrist . " fry 's magazine comments are " likely to be dismissed by those who have embraced the idea of women 's ability to have unemotional , uncommitted sex as an empowered lifestyle choice . " the observer notes that fry 's remarks have " too much aggression and unkindness around . " but the observer adds that it was clear that women had no interest in sex from the fact that they do n't go out seeking casual encounters in graveyards or on hampstead rocks . " stephen fry , who has almost two million followers , says the non-partisan sex authority " would n't even begin having a lot of laughs . "
