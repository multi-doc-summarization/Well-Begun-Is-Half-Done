leston lawrence was found guilty of stealing 22 gold pucks from the mint on last year 's eve in ottawa , and he 's now been sentenced to 30 months in prison , the guardian reports . according to the ottawa citizen , 35-year-old leston lawrence had used the money to buy a house in jamaica and pay a $ 190,000 fine within three years of his release . he was caught , not by the mint , but through an alert bank employee , he managed to sell 17 of the pucks for a total of about $ 130,000 . " he sometimes worked alone and the process meant periods out of sight of the only security camera in the room , " the judge said , per the guardian . the mint says it 's not clear if barnes was convicted of stealing the gold puck from a safety deposit box . barnes says he was told he would have to serve an additional 30 months if he does n't pay the $ 130,000 fine . but he says he did n't have the money , and that 's not the case . " the pucks exactly fit the unique ladle used at the mint and vaseline and latex gloves were found in lawrence 's locker at work , " he says . he says lawrence must repay the fine within a three years , but he 's not sure how much it will go . " i do n't think that 's what i 'm going to do , " lawrence says . " i think it 's going to happen . " ( a royal canadian mint employee is suing over the scam . )
