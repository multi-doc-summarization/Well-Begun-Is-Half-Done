the treasury department is trying to figure out what it 's calling a " social security breach " that 's getting a lot of attention , writes megan mcardle at the new york times . it 's " not accessible for millions of americans , especially seniors , " she writes . " the transformative power of technology is real , but so is the divide . across the country , more than 50 % of americans lack internet access , and seniors make up the lion 's share of the more than 30 million households do not even own a bank account . " the treasury , for example , says it 's working to fix the problem , but that 's not the case , writes mcardle . " it 's time for the government to do something about it . " and it 's not just a matter of contention , writes felix salmon at the washington post . " if you 're going to get a copy of the equation , you 'll be going to have to go online to interact with their government , " he writes . " it â€™ s time to get the job done . "
