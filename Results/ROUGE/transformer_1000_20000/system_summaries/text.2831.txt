a new study out of greenland suggests that greenland 's albedo , albedo , has been decreasing since the 90s , the new york times reports . according to a press release , the study found that the greenland ice sheet could be ten % darker than it is today . the study looked at data from the earth institute and published today in the cryosphere , and found that greenland had a higher rate of 0.02decade−1 between 1996 and 2012 , the guardian reports . the study was published thursday in the journal cryosphere . the researchers found that in the study , the <unk> and soot grains—buried just beneath the surface of the ice sheet . the researchers say the findings suggest that the discrepancy between meltwater formation and ice albedo through the amount of ice sheet increases . " we have a lot more energy to do , " says lead researcher marco rubio . " we do n't know how much we can do about this . " the study 's lead author says the findings are based on evidence that the effects of meltwater formation have been shown to reduce the risk of melting glaciers , the bbc reports . " it 's bad news for the ice , " he says . " it ’ s a good thing to do . "
