brad pitt and jennifer aniston have been feuding over their marriage to jennifer aniston , but they 're not happy about it . " i do n't know what was together or put together . all i know is that my point was , the best thing i 'd done as a father is be sure that my kids have a good mother , " he said , per the hollywood reporter . " that 's all i was , or am , trying to say . it has no reference to the past . and i think it 's a shame that i ca n't say something nice about angie without being drug in . you know , she does n't deserve it . " pitt , meanwhile , is taking flak for his handling of the kardashians controversy . " people read things into it that just were n't there , " pitt said . " when you are a spectator , you are left behind the gate , so to speak . so getting inside was a real privilege . " he added that he 's " not going to get to do every day , " adding , " i 'm going to have to say anything bad like that . "
