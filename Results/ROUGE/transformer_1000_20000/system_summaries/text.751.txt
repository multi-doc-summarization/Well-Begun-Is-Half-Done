reality star tila tequila posted a daily mail article about james howe 's death in 1981 , and it 's a doozy of a tribute to the author of the new york times piece . in an excerpt from the book , tequila writes that it was " the only possible conclusion to her trajectory : as an incoherent , hitler-sympathizing , anti-semitic conspiracy theorist . " he writes that he 's " had nothing to do with the damn thing , " but that 's not the case . " we â€™ ve removed the signature . tilisis is the goddess of love & war ! learn your facts ! " he goes on to explain that the image was " edited " and that it 's " going to be a bit more forceful than ever . " the piece was headlined " why i sympathize with hitler , but i do n't know what it was like , " writes sadie <unk> at the washington post . " it was a photoshopped image of the <unk> tequila overlaid with the words ' <unk> ' <unk> ' and <unk> ' in the <unk> , ' " she writes . " i was not a coward , but it was n't like it . i was just trying to figure out what was going on , and i was n't going to have to say it , " she adds , adding that she 's " a little bit more mature than i 've ever seen . "
