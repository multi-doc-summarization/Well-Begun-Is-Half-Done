a new study out of the scripps research institute in florida suggests that the test could lead to a blood test for alzheimer 's , reports healthday news . researchers found that six people with mild cognitive impairment had elevated concentrations of the same antibodies found in alzheimer 's patients , and those with the disease had elevated antibodies to the immune system . " we 've even looked at a couple of other forms of dementia , " says the lead researcher . " these really do appear to be quite specific to alzheimer 's . " the new york times reports that the study , published in cell biology , found that the blood test looks to be unreliable . the upshot is that the body may produce antibodies in the blood of the disease , but it 's not clear whether it will be used to detect alzheimer 's . " the immediate utility of that is to help us understand how the disease impacts the body , " he says . " it 's a matter of time . " the researchers say the breakthrough could be applied in six to seven months , and they hope to shed more light on the disease .
