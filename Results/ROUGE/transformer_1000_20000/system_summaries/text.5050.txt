if you 're looking for a tasty meal , you 're not alone . a new study finds that the male widow of a black widow is monogamous , and that 's what researchers say is a " thing " among the species . researchers from university of toronto say they 've uncovered a correlation between male spiders and females with immature females , the guardian reports . " normally , mature female spiders engage in sexual cannibalism—an evolutionary strategy that improves a species ’ s reproductive success , " lead researcher spermatheca <unk> says in a press release . the male spiders penetrate right through this exoskeleton to deposit sperm into the female 's exoskeleton , and then very carefully deposits his seed in the female ’ s sperm . the researchers say that while the males do n't have a reproductive organs , they have " matured " and that they 're not a rare occurrence , reports the los angeles times , which notes that the tactic " is clearly a <unk> " and also " improves an evolutionary trajectory of this normally cannibalistic species . " but the study does n't necessarily establish causation , which could lead to a more thorough reassessment of the female spiders , which is why it could n't have been used for a long time . " it 's a completely selfish act of experimentation may be causing any injury to the female , " the lead researcher says , noting that " this kind of experimentation can be applied for a fetish among a species already known for its extreme and violent sex acts .
