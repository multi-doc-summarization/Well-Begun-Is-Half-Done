police in chicago say a man tied up and his mouth covered , leaving a visibly bald patch of cowering in the corner of a room , the chicago tribune reports . police say the man , identified as eddie johnson , was so traumatized that it took most of the night for him to calm down so he was able to talk to police . " the victim is white and the people in the video are black , and they make stupid decisions , " a police spokesman tells cnn . " that certainly will be part of whether or not this is sincere or just stupid and raving . " police say they are investigating whether hate crime charges are appropriate . " although they are adults , they 're young adults , " says a police rep . " kids make stupid choices -- - white people . " the man was arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping , hate crime , and unlawful restraint . police say he has no connection to the attack , but he is expected to be filed thursday . the tribune reports that the family of the two men and two women , all 18 , are in custody awaiting charges .
