" i love 'em . many , many people from mexico are legal . they came in the old-fashioned way . legally . he quickly returned to the sharp tone that has brought him scorn as well as praise . " " i respect mexico greatly as a country . but the problem we have is their leaders are much sharper than ours , and they 're killing us on trade . " trump said he was " dumb " and " childish " when he called for a wall of rubber bullets .

" he added , however , that it 's not clear whether trump will be able to do so . trump 's speeches in both venues were long on insults aimed at critics and short on solutions to the problems he sees as treasonous . the ap notes that in a saturday night rally , trump waxed nostalgic about the " chaos " in the crowd , concluding that the " real question " is how much the crowd will be .
