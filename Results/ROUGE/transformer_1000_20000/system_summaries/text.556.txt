" drugs were a major love in her life as june had no hobbies , made no contribution to society and rarely shared a kind word or deed , her life . please let june miller ’ s life be a cautionary tale . addiction and hatred are no bueno for the living , " says robert miller , 82 , who was in florida and had a summer home in murphy . the obituary , which chronicled the obit , says it 's " untrue " to describe the obituary as " tragic and sad . " it 's not clear whether the obituary will be missed by many , very few tears will be shed , and there will be no over her fate . " the obit was written in the vallejo times herald , which notes that it was n't written in june . " unbelievable , " writes joseph wood at the atlantic .
