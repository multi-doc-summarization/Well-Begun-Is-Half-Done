mariah carey ’ s new year 's eve performance on dick clark ’ s rockin ' eve has been a rough one . “ we told them [ the stage managers ] that the in-ears were not working on the frequency four minutes before the performance , ” she tells billboard . “ they then changed the battery , and they were still counting her down and reassuring her that they will work as soon as they go live , which never happened . " she says she could n't hear through her in-ear monitors , but she did say she was “ crying and yelling , ‘ hey , i ’ m sorry , ' " the new york daily news reports . " i ’ ve never seen anything like that , " she adds . " it was just a matter of time . " but she adds that the born-again christian faith group is refusing to apologize to the singer . " i am sorry for the loss of my life . i am so sorry . i am not going to apologize . i apologize to my fans . i apologize for my actions . "
