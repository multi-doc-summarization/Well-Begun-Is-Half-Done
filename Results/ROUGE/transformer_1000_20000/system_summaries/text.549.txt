a new study out of plos one finds that the word " huh. " is not a word at all . researchers at the max planck institute for psycholinguistics in the netherlands say they 've found similar versions in five continents , including dutch , the west african siwu , and the australian aboriginal murrinh-patha . the study , published in plos one , found that all of them have a word with a near-identical sound and function as english 'huh . " this is one of the findings of a major cross-linguistic study by the european research council , " says lead researcher mark dingemanse . " without words like this we would be unable to signal when we have problems with hearing or understanding what was said , and our conversations would be constantly derailed . " the study 's lead author , francisco torreira , tells the guardian that it 's " frivolous " and that " usually words in unrelated languages sound are completely different . " that 's because it 's a " universal word , " he says , noting that " it 's remarkable to carry out scientific research on a word like 'huh ? " the scientists zeroed in on their findings , and they found that the " huh ? " is that it is a " very similar form and function in across the globe . " ( another study found that a man misses a lot of time . )
