new jersey state senate president stephen sweeney says he 's not going to take it lying down . " we appreciate senator sweeney 's interest , " he told reporters at a monday night press conference , per the star-ledger . " i 've got ta get our refs back . " he added that the nfl " has been in negotiations with the union for the past week . " the nfl is the same league that has sued new jersey to stop sports betting for a threat to the integrity of the game . " the packers , who are petitioning the mandalay bay and seattle seahawks , say they have n't seen a factory or construction site to operate without fully trained referees , the ap reports . " this past weekend in the nfl has not only made a mockery of a great sport , but it 's a very bright light on how important fully trained and professional is to player safety , " sweeney said in a statement . " it 's hard to believe that the packers will be able to do this . " sweeney , a democrat , says the game will " continue to focus on the game . " but the washington post points out that the seahawks are divided over whether the game played a role in the game , and the packers say they 'll have to wait until the end of the year .
