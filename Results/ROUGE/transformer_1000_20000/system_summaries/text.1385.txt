if you 're looking for a byline , you 're not alone . the wall street journal reports twitter double its character limit from 140 to 280 , according to the new york times . it 's the first twitter user to do so , and it 's not the only one to do it . the journal 's take : " if you click that , you â€™ ll see a little button on the tweet . " it 's a tweet from the times : " imagine my surprise , then , when i read last week that i had a long , mostly incoherent argument about the merits of longer tweets with mathew ingram , a blogger at gigaom explains . " i tried to tell that his article was equally dumb for suggesting that i was proposing unlimited-character tweets rather than a <unk> . ' " the journal also notes that the company 's original purpose was to drop the character limit . but the journal points out that the new tweets are " inevitable " and " ferocious , " and that 's why people often resort to hacks like twitter , facebook , and other social media users . the verge notes that twitter 's algorithms do n't seem to mesh with the tweets , but they do n't appear to have been updated to see the bigger tweets .
