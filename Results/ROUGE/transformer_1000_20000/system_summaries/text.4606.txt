julian assange says he wants to avoid extradition to sweden over a rape claim that he has lost his case against the united kingdom and sweden , the bbc reports . the swedish foreign ministry says the swedish panel 's decision would have " no formal impact " on its ongoing investigation . assange , 44 , says he will accept arrest by british police if a group working on arbitrary detention decides that the three years he has holed up in the ecuadorean embassy does not amount to illegal detention . " i do n't think that 's going to happen , " he says . " i think it 's time to do that . " assange , who is currently being arbitrarily detained in the uk , is expected to be arrested if he leaves the embassy in 2012 , reuters reports . the swedish government says it is investigating whether assange will be arrested , but the bbc notes that it 's not clear whether the swedish embassy will be able to verify the allegations . assange 's lawyer , meanwhile , says that if the ecuadorian embassy is notified of the decision , it will not be allowed to do so , the ap reports .
