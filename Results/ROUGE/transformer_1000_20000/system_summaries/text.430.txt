a michigan man is becoming facebook famous after he posted a picture of a ticket he received from a cop for warming up his own driveway , the detroit free press reports . " i 've never heard of any ordinance like that , " nick taylor wrote in a facebook post . " it was a cold and he wanted to keep it safe . " the ticket was left running in the driveway with no one around , but taylor says it was n't tearing up his car . " it 's just a matter of fuel injection and on-board computers . it 's how long it takes for the oil to get from the bottom to the top of your engine , where the moving parts are , " taylor wrote . " there 's no need in this modern era . " the officer who gave him the ticket says he was aware of the ticket , but he says he did n't know what he was going to do . he says the picture is for his car , which he says is " very disturbing . " he says it 's not clear if the car was going on , but the officer says he does n't need to be able to steal the ticket . " i do n't think it 's going to happen , " he tells the post . " i 'm not going to have a conversation about it . it 's a good thing to do . " ( this man was arrested after a car accident . )
