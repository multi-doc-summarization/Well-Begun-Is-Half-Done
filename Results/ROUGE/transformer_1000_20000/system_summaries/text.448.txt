the european space agency says it has uncovered a " very low orbit " of the atlantic ocean 's gravity field , but it 's not clear exactly what happened to the freighter , which is the first esa mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry in more than 25 years . the bbc reports that the last contact by ground tracking stations with europe 's gravity and steady-state ocean circulation agency was tasked with retrieving it . the satellite ran out of fuel on october 21 , and it was launched in 2009 . " this would put the main area over which any possible goce fell to the southernmost regions of the falkland islands , " says the space agency 's chief technology officer . " no damage to property has been reported from any debris , " he adds , noting that it 's " very broad . " that 's because of its " sleek " goce , goce , and <unk> modelling that had been steadily losing altitude since the earth 's gravity . but the bbc notes that the new maps have been hampered by re-entry , with the times noting that even if the freighter 's atmosphere sank , it would have been able to compress it in the first place . that 's the result of a quarter of the car-sized satellite 's orbit , and the bbc says it 's now looking into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet 's crust and the mantle .
