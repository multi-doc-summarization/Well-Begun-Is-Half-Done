china 's increasingly ambitious space program plans to attempt the first-ever landing of a lunar probe on the moon 's far side , a leading engineer tells al jazeera . the chang ' e 4 mission is planned for sometime before zou yongliao from the chinese academy of sciences ' moon exploration department told cctv in an interview on wednesday . zou says the mission 's objective would be solved by having a spacecraft orbiting the moon to relay radio signals from the far side of the moon will require more satellite technology to communicate with the probe , which currently ca n't be reached with transmissions from earth . " the communication problem will be blocking radio transmissions , " michael brown , an observational astronomer at monash university in austrailia , says , noting that the moon is not visible from earth . while china became the third country ( after the united states and the soviet union to land a probe on lunar soil in 2013 ) , it would be the first of its kind , could enable the chinese to place an unmanned radio telescope on the planet , the ap reports . the moon , known as chang , is leading the mission , zou said in an email to the associated press . " this should n't be too difficult a problem to solve , given spacecraft rovers that are driving around on that planet. . "
