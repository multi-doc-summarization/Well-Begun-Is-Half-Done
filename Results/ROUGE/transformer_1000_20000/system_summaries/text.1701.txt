the oklahoma department of corrections is investigating the botched lethal injection of clayton lockett , who was granted a stay of execution after lockett 's death , reports the guardian . " we haven ’ t had much discussion about it , because it ’ s not been pressing at the moment , " says corrections spokesman jerry massie . " the transfer happened a number of years ago , and i ’ m not sure anybody has the complete story on who legally owns it . " he says the electric chair should be on display for the public to see . " i don ’ t think it does anybody any good for it to sit in storage , " harrison says . " that chair has not been used since 1966 , " he adds . " my assumption would be if it ever got to the point electric chair was needed again they would start with a new one . " harrison , who is to die the same night , is expected to be executed on november 13 . he says he 's not sure where it was , but the state would get a new electric chair , and the corrections department says it is investigating whether lockett will be executed . the state law allows for the firing squad to be used only if lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional .
