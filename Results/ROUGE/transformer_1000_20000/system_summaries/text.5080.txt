a restaurant in new york city is apologizing after a customer complained about a customer 's dessert debacle that contained ice cream . " even with all that whipped cream you ca n't make a rape joke palatable , " the restaurant 's owner , patricia gaja , tells advance media . " we treat our guests with the utmost respect and we are always open to feedback to make our restaurant a welcoming and comfortable place with a touch of humor and quirkiness , " he says . " please be advised that the dessert is currently off the menu until it is renamed . " page six notes that it 's not clear whether the dessert was actually meant to be registered on their fb page . " the elephant is a place with unique atmosphere , " says a patron who owns the gastropub , which has been on the menu since the summer . " we certainly did not intend to create an impression of reckless or negligent behavior by presenting the community around us and its awareness toward our guests nor did we mean to make anyone feel uncomfortable or insulted . this desert name was simply a homage to an adult cartoon and there was no malice . "
