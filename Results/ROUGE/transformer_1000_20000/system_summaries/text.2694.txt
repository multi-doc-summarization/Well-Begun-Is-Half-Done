the first four early voting states in the iowa caucuses are on the rise in the polls , and the latest polls suggest that donald trump is going to be a no-show for the first time . in a poll released tuesday , trump 's lead author , ben carson , is seen as the only other candidate to register on this question , the washington post reports . " i do n't think the media or the party have a real grasp on how deep the anger and frustration is around the country , " he says . " i think the trump phenomenon is becoming real , " says a quinnipiac university poll . " but it 's not going to happen . " the poll , conducted by politico , finds that trump has been building a " solid organization " in the past few years , and he has n't been seen as a stand-in for the trump campaign . " i 'm not saying it wo n't happen again , " trump says , adding that " we 're going to have to wait a long time to figure out what to do . " politico reports that trump 's campaign manager , steve bannon , has said that while he 's " skeptical " about trump 's chances of winning the election , it 's possible he will win the states if their primaries were held today .
