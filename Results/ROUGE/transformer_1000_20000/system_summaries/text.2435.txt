" it 's that kind of response that lets you know something ' wrong with our culture and we all need to work together to change it , " she tells the new york times . " but this body fascism is it surrounds us , seeping into our minds from the pages of women 's magazines and the garishly humiliation of shame , spieling like hateful streamers from the mouths of celebrated people , and our own peers , too . " schumer , who has been outspoken on the script for years , says she has no regrets about her decision , but she has n't spoken to her about it . " i 've never seen anything like that , " schumer tells diane sawyer at salon . " i was considering it , i was initially disappointed . that disappointment was nothing to do with it . " she adds that she believes the girls who see this happening every day , and that she does n't have the right figure to do so without the perfect <unk> . " i do n't think it 's a bit hypocritical , but i think it was a woman in the mirror i know who i am , ‚Äù she says . but she says it 's time for schumer to quit her job , and she hopes to " change the minds of people .
