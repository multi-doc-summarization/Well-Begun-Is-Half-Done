john boehner 's vision for the debt ceiling is n't going to be a good one , but pundits are divided on what he 's doing . here 's what they 're saying : " the president never wanted any kind of deal at all , but he did n't want us to start bothering our pretty little heads about it now , " writes peggy noonan in the washington post . " it simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that congress has already agreed to , " she writes . " we don â€™ t seem to be as ignorant as obama thinks we are of the term or concept of a debt ceiling . " the gop is trying to overturn the " fiscal cliff " debate , but it 's " not a good deal , " complains joe klein in the new york times . it 's a " win-win , " but " if you listened to boehner monday night , you 'd think he and obama never discussed a deal . " " the only thing that 's going to happen now is that the president is going to have a hard time going on , " he writes . " if it does n't happen again , that would have been a deal-breaker either . " the debt " does not allow congress to spend more money . " but if it 's time to fix the deficit , it would have to wait a few weeks to get the deficit back . " the " debt ceiling " could be a game-changer , writes paul vigna at the washington post <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
