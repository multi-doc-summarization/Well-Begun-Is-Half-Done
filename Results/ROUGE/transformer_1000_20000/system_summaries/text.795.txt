stevie johnson is a secret agent in the united states for the first time since he started talking about north korea 's escalating nuclear threats toward the us . " i know some of yall took it too serious.. but i have much respect for the league probably does n't want to picture it either , " he says , per usa today . " so , yeah , johnson 's joke was in bad taste . but given that most american citizens are n't taking north korea very seriously , how can you fault a wide receiver for doing the same thing ? plus , it 's not as if kim jong un and his staff are going to listen to anything like that . " johnson , who has n't commented on johnson 's remarks , says it was n't a very nice thing to say and no one wants to picture gillette stadium as a hole in the ground with kim jong <unk> . " we all know that role is reserved for the rest of the nfl team . gon na be a great # nfl2013 . " ( see the video here . )
