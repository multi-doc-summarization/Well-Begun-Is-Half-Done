ahmed wali karzai , the president 's half-brother and a major player in afghanistan , died tuesday at the age of 45 , the new york times reports . he was shot to death by a police official , sardar muhammad , who was accused of gunning down karzai for a decade . " if we are going to conduct a population-centric strategy in afghanistan and we are perceived as backing thugs , then we are just undermining ourselves , " he said . " the only way to clean up chicago is to get rid of capone . " karzai , who had been working with trucking contractors that sold for $ <unk> million in 2001 , is now believed to have funneled money to the cia , reuters reports . karzai 's family has said that the cia had no evidence that muhammad was involved in the killings , but it 's not clear whether he was the one who killed wali karzai in the 1979 soviet invasion . but the times notes that it 's unclear why karzai was killed in the airstrike , which killed karzai last year , was the result of the death of karzai and the taliban . the times reports that karzai 's death toll is expected to rise in the wake of his death .
