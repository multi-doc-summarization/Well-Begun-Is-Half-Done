it 's been a rough week for the white house , and it 's not the first time a waitress in washington , dc , has pulled over his glass of water . that 's the conclusion of a new york city restaurant , which is owned by a restaurant owner , who says she was shocked at how rude my server was . " i did n't wan na make a scene , so i got my point across with the tip . i generally tip at least 20 % not even close , " she says , adding that she 's " more of a vegetarian , " and that " i will only rate this restaurant and not add commentary . this is your place ! i prefer chick-fil-a myself continues to remove my reviews although they 've been honest and well written . " she 's not alone , but she says she does n't know what she 's talking about , and she does say it 's time for her to go back to georgia . " if you like a slice of liberal hypocrisy with your meal , this is a place ! " she writes . " it was not as sad of an experience as i thought it would be , but it would have been impossible to do that . "
