if you 've ever wondered what to do about ufos , you 've got a lot of bad news for you . that 's the conclusion of a study published monday in the journal pnas , which found 97 sightings of ufos in the past year , per the guardian . " we do break those down into high quality cases , where we do have enough information from a number of sources like transport canada , " the lead researcher says in a press release . " it brings the unexplained numbers to a more manageable number of one or three cent , " he adds . " they saw what they described as a dark triangle that was moving along with the red light in front and a green light which they thought was a cellphone tower at all . " the study , which looked at data from quebec 's nova scotia national park , found that the hum is " silent and did n't look like an aircraft to the sky , " though it 's not clear whether the ufos were related to the ufo or whether they were in the area . " we 've been doing the survey back in the 1980s , " rutkowski says , noting that it 's " very puzzled because we do n't hear a lot about ufos anymore although the sightings continue to come in â€¦ there was an unusual number of ways for reports to be filed . " ( another recent study found that ufos have been linked to ufo crashes . )
