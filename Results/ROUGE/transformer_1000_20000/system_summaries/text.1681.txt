it 's been a rough week for the first time in more than a century , but it 's not the only thing that 's happened to be in the atlantic ocean . jonathan trappe posted a photo of trappe 's boat with the caption , " i 've never been so glad to see the media , " per the new york daily news . " it 's like france ' once he was on the ground , " he wrote . " i was burning through too quickly to make it across the atlantic . " trappe , who had been attempting to cross the ocean with a link to a satellite map showing his location in a remote part of the remote bay area , had been chartered by cbc to conduct an aerial survey of the balloons , including flying in a house , much of a mile away from the nearest hamlet of <unk> , maine , on thursday , per a promotional video . " hmm , this does n't look like france , " says trappe , whose crew was able to access the balloons to settle in for the night and was n't allowed to return to the remote site , where he 's now being reassigned to a local humane society shelter . " it is not an emergency . " trappe 's facebook page has been shared more than 55,000 times and has since been raised more than 300 times , and it 's now set to go on monday . " we 're going to see a lot of people who have n't been there , and we 've got the adventure , " trappe says . " we are going to be very happy . "
