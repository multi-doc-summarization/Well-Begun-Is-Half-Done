" never . not that mess of a child i saw with my own two eyes . no one has mentioned the army 's failure here and the discharge unit who agreed to send him out there . " manning 's lawyer , david coombs , says he 's relieved that he was unfit to go to iraq , but he does n't want to be identified because of the hostility towards manning in the military . he says he has no idea what to do with manning 's tour of duty in iraq . manning , a lawyer for the fort leonard military base in missouri , says that manning was harassed so much that he once downloaded thousands of dollars worth of information , and that he did n't know what he was doing when he was sent to iraq .
