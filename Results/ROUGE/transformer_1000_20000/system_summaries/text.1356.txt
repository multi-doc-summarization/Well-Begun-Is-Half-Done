the international experimental reactor is being built in the south of france , and it 's the most expensive machine in the world , according to a new study . the researchers say they 've uncovered a " magnetic bottle " of superconducting magnets , which will be used to create a <unk> cloud of heavy hydrogen gas , the guardian reports . " it 's like a strand of dna as it circulates , " says the study 's lead author . " this is the first time it has been used to achieve something like this . " the study , published in the journal of technology advances , says that the reactor 's core size is " very minimal " and that it 's " very difficult to overstate the importance of affordability . " the report , published wednesday in plos one , calls the report " a stunning culmination of decades of research , " noting that the machine 's output could be up to two hundred million times faster than the speed of sound . " it would have been a very significant event , " the lead researcher says . " it was just a matter of time , but it was a lot bigger than it was . it was n't a huge surprise . it was the first phase of the project to be suspended , and the new yorker notes that the project 's goal was to create " one another , hundred feet tall , and more than half the weight of the eiffel tower .
