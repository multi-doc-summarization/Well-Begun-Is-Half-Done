" it 's not the first time the fbi has figured out what to do about it , but it 's going to have to do something about it . " i do n't know what it is , but i do think it 's a big deal , " he says . " i think it would happen to anyone who 's ever been able to do that , and i think i 've got to do it . i 'm not going to get it done . i 've never had a problem with it . i have no idea what i 'm going to do . " the washington post , meanwhile , reports that the white house has been trying to figure out how to handle the president 's inauguration , and it has n't been confirmed whether he will be able to get his campaign back on the campaign trail .
