if you 're not a fan of the restaurant table , you 're going to have to pay a fee of $ 33,000 a year . that 's because , as kpcc reports , it 's not exactly the only thing you 'd expect from the restaurant chain : " i was shocked quite frankly , i did n't have any expectations . we were running for two months , and then , being slow in the week or so . i think it 's still summertime , school gets back into session . this is a week later and we just got german radio calling us right now , and something from india , it â€™ s just crazy . " the restaurant owner says he 's done about 40 interviews with major outlets including cnn and good morning america . " i 've gotten numerous emails from restaurant owners , shop owners from all over the world saying , 'what a great policy ' and 'thank you so much , ' " he says . " it seems like every five minutes there 's somebody calling , and it 's hard to focus on the meal and the company at the same time . " gold , for instance , is the norm with customers constantly taunting their friends , tweeting an instagram photo of the meal they 're about to chow down . " we 've seen a little bit of an increase , but not as much as we expected , " eva gardner writes . " it 's become part of our restaurant table setting : knife , fork , napkin and cell phone . "
