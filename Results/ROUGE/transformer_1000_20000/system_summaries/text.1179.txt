the new york times is out with a piece headlined " david paterson , " but it 's a doozy of a scathing piece of the puzzle . it 's not clear whether the governor will read the entire piece , but the gist of the story is that he 's been talking about a " kafkaesque nightmare " for the first time since the paper closed its publication , and it does n't matter how much he 's talking about it . " i think it 's going to happen , " he writes . " i 'm not going to be a long time . " the piece was headlined by larry king , who writes that paterson " has been a case study in just how hard it is to take away the chattering class ' delicious rumors have been swirling around the media , and that 's not the case . " it was n't the first piece of editorial columns today , but it did n't make any sense of humor , writes chris cillizza at the washington post . it 's " a little bit like a joke , " and that " the question hangs over everything : what the hell is in that article ? thus , it â€™ s an appropriate allusion though , since paterson ended up on larry king live .
