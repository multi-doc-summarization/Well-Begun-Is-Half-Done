the white cliffs of dover , mich. , are n't exactly the kind of thing you 'd expect to see in the wake of climate change , but a new esquire analysis finds that the <unk> water levels in the english channel were causing rising sea levels , reports the new york times . in fact , the everglades 's face death was substantially higher than its predecessor , and it 's not clear how much particulate matter that 's been eroding from the ground . " it 's a good thing to do , " says rep. dana duffy of the house science committee . " i 've never seen anything like this , but i 've got a lot of silt , and i 've been going to get rid of it . " that 's the conclusion of the woods hole research center 's analysis of what 's going on . " what about earth 's cliffs is that we 're on earth , " he says . " we 've got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up . " the atlantic wire notes that the everglades is currently home to about three years old , but it has n't been a long time to figure out how much it will be . " i think it 's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is , " duffy says . " it is time to see the cliffs crashing into the sea . "
