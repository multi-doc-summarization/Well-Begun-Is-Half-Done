the freeh report that jerry sandusky and a scathing report on the child abuse scandal is out , but it 's not the first time the ncaa has acknowledged that it will levy the " corrective and punitive measures " against penn state in the wake of the scandal , reports the los angeles times . " we believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth about sandusky , it should matter that joe paterno has never had a hearing ; that his legal counsel has never been able to interview key witnesses , all of whom are represented by lawyers and therefore unavailable ; that selective evidence and the opinion of mr . paterno is treated as the equivalent of a fair trial , " says a prosecutor . " despite this obviously flawed and one-sided presentation , the university believes it must have been for the university to take a strong stand in support of due process so that the complete truth can be uncovered . it is not the university 's responsibility to defend or protect joe paterno . but they at least should have acknowledged that important legal cases are still pending and that the record on joe paterno , the board and other key players is far from complete .
