brazil 's new rules and a campaign called " childbirth is normal ! " address what health minister arthur chioro calls a " epidemic " of cesareans , currently accounting for more than half of the world 's highest rates of cesarean deliveries , the bbc reports . the world health organization says more than 15 % of brazilian mothers on private health care undergo the operation , which the bbc notes is a " small incision in the mother 's abdomen . " the new guidelines require doctors and hospitals to share information with patients , notably the number of pregnant women in the united states and 1 in 4 women in private hospitals . " we do them , he says , but rarely . " in public hospitals , that figure is approximately 40 % . this is one of the most important moments in the life of a woman and her family , " chioro says . " it 's not a vaginal delivery . " brazil , for its part , says it will be the first state to steer the country from its status as a world leader in c-section births . but it does n't necessarily mean that the baby will be able to choose the date , and it will also have to wait a few weeks to figure out how much the fetus will be delivered . " i think there 's a lot more to do with it than it is , " says the head of the office of the american academy of sciences . " but it 's time to do something about it . "
