tesla 's transport department is trying to figure out how to make a tesla model s registered in april , but it 's not going anywhere anytime soon . the city has capped the tax waiver at electric-vehicle ( ev , a policy that went into effect on april 1 and is expected to last until march next year , reports the wall street journal . the move comes after the government eliminated tax breaks for a $ 570,000 donation from hong kong 's environmental protection department . hong kong had 11,004 in use as a paywall for the company , but the company did n't rely on government policies . " there were 2,939 first-time registrations in march just before the new tax rules kicked in , around five times that of the number in february . as a result , it 's to be expected that demand will be impacted in the period immediately following the change , particularly because of the large number who bought just prior to the change being implemented , " says tesla ceo elon musk . hong kong , for its part , says it 's " very strong " that the company 's business was " excellent. , " and that it would have been able to sell cars there each quarter . " when the hong kong government reduced the tax exemption for electric vehicles and increased the cost of our cars by nearly 100 % , it would continue to flow , " he says . " but it is a proxy as the car needs to be registered in order to run on the road in hong kong . "
