italy 's national statistical agency istat as it calculates the country 's gross domestic product calculation this year , reports the guardian . the eu says it will include three areas of illegal activities , in line with methodology being applied in measuring national accounts within the european union . the move comes in september , when istat said it would " have a positive impact on gdp , " reports the new york times . " even if the impact is hard to quantify , it 's obvious it will have a greater margin this year to spend " without breaching the deficit limit , " says a spokesman for rome 's luiss university . " therefore renzi will be able to measure the illegal activities of prostitution , illegal drug trafficking , and trafficking in contraband and cigarettes will all be measured . " istat says it 's not clear how many accounts for illegal drug sales , but it 's still unclear whether it 's related to the underground economy , which is currently in the last 13 years , the guardian reports . the move follows a 1995 economic spike in chronically high prostitution rates in italy , where the gdp rose to 2.6 % last year .
