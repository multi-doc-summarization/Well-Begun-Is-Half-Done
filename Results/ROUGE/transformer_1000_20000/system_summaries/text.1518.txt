kenny g 's uncle my uncle my dad 's brother was , i think , the very first guy that gave howard schultz money to get starbucks growing . now , thanks to a new interview with bloomberg , kenny g is teaming up with howard schultz to create a " starbucks drink of choice and not espresso machines , " and that 's not the case . " at the beginning , starbucks didn ’ t have anything but coffee , and there was another company , coffee bean , that had … something called blended , " g says . " and i would always call howard and say , ' i know you ’ ve been selling some cds . meet this guy howard schultz . give him some money for his company starbucks. ' and so i think that part of the reason that they did frappuccinos was people like me giving them that kind of feedback . " the saxophonist , who was born in the 1990s , says he was inspired by the frappuccino and the rest of the world , including the frappuccino , a <unk> , <unk> , and a cheddar burgers , per the new york daily news . the company says it 's not interested in acquiring the espresso , but it says it has no plans to do so . " it ’ s a great day for the perfect latte , " he says in a statement . " it 's a good thing to do about it . "
