" there is no denying that the population represents an unusual , rather uniform , demographic , " the national catholic reporter says . " we do n't have to wait for a wine , but we 've got to see what it 's like to do . " in fact , it 's a population of 800 people over the course of a year , and it has a 92 % chance of succeeding at the top than simply its size alone . " i do n't know how many people have to do that , " says the director of the wine institute . " i think it 's time to say that it 's going to happen . "
