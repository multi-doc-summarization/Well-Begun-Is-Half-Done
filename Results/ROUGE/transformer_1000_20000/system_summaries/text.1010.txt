president trump and congressional lawmakers say they are " just another very small step , not a big deal . " the north korean foreign ministry said tuesday that the un resolution represented the " strongest set of sanctions " so far , adding that " the greatest pain and suffering it had ever gone through in its entire history , " the ap reports . " we do n't threaten china , even a little bit , with country sanctions because that would be difficult , politically , " to do , said rep. brad sherman , a california democrat . " the 'resolution ' was fabricated by the us employing all sorts of despicable and vicious methods , " he said . " that 's significant . " the new york times reports that the vote came after lawmakers from both parties expressed frustration that the us is n't going to stop north korea from developing nuclear weapons capable of striking the continental united states . the south korean central news agency says the sanctions pale in comparison to " what ultimately will have to happen " to north korea , which has been criticized for politicizing the north 's march 4 nuclear test . the us says it has n't seen any impact on north korea since the north began attacking the north , but it does n't appear to be the first such test in the history of north korea .
