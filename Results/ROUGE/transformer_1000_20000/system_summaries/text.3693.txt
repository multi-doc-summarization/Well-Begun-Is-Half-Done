a new study in the british medical journal suggests that people who adhered to the mediterranean diet had a higher risk of developing heart disease than their peers , reports the guardian . the researchers looked at tiny structures called telomeres that safeguard the ends of our chromosomes , which store our dna code from scrambling as we age , according to a press release . they found that telomere length was associated with a three-point diet , and the results of the study were " not clear exactly what makes it so good , its key components - an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as poultry and fruits , " the lead researcher says . " the findings suggest that the higher fruits of vegetables are more likely to be pessimistic , " he adds . " it 's a good thing to do . " in the study , the researchers found that the diet had fewer signs of heart disease , and that the mediterranean 's diet was more responsible for the effects of telomere length . " we have a lot of questions , " says one of the researchers . " this is a big step forward . "
