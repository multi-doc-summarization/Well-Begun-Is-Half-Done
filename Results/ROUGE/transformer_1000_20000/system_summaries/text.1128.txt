president trump 's battle with the sixth floor of an unmarked federal office is getting a lot more complicated . the new york times reports that the white house is looking into whether trump will be able to appoint a nominee for president in the 2018 election . the times says the move is a " big deal " for trump , but the gist of the story is that he 's not going to be the only one he 's ever seen . " i think it 's time to say that i 'm going to have to do something about it , " he says . " i do n't know what it 's going to happen . " the washington post reports that trump has been toying with the idea of a " hearing " on the issue , which he sees as a " serious escalation " in the election . in a statement , trump said he was " disappointed " by the decision . " we have no idea what to do about this , but we have a lot to do with it . " he added : " it 's a very good day for trump to be president . "
