a new study out of the university of arizona suggests that the magma reservoir may have been responsible for the eruption of mount st. helens , killing 57 people . the study , published in geophysical research , found that fossilized ash from the most recent eruption of the yellowstone national park in 1980 was the result of a massive eruption of ash and ash at once 2,500 times more material than previous estimates , the los angeles times reports . " it 's not the planet 's only buried supervolcano , " says lead researcher hannah <unk> , who led the study to a study published wednesday . " it is a very big step forward . " the study 's lead author tells the times that the eruption could be a " very significant event " for the first time in more than a century . " this video helps you understand what causes volcanoes to form and eruptâ€”and shows where they are most likely to be found , " he says , adding that the study is " very much statistically significant . " the researchers say they 've found evidence of a supereruption scars on the planet every 100,000 years , but they warn that it could lead to more than 1,000 cubic miles of rock and ash . " we have a lot more to do with it , and we 've never seen anything like this before . " ( another recent study found that ash could be the biggest reservoir in the world . )
