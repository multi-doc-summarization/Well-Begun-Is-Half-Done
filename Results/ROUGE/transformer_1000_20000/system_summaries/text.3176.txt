woody allen , the author of the daily beast , says he 's on trial for lying about what woody allen calls " a systematic abuse of innocence to dylan farrow , " but that 's not the case . " i 've never seen anything like that , " he says . " i do n't know what happened , but i think it 's time to say that i 'm going to have to do that . " he adds that he does n't resolve the issue , but " i think that 's what i 've done . " " i have a lot of things that i 've ever seen , and i think i 've got a lot more to do with it . i 've been trying to figure out how to do this . " but he says that 's because " it 's not a liar , " and that " i 'm not going to do anything wrong . " he also points out that allen 's affair with farrow is a " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , misogynist , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . " if you are saying things like we can ’ t really know , it ’ s fine , " she says , adding that " if i ’ ve ever met someone else , i ’ ll never have a conversation about it . i ’ m not saying anything about it . i don ’ t think that ’ s what convinces me to believe . " ( allen 's son ronan farrow says he has no regrets . )
