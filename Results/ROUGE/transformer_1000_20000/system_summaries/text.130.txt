chinese authorities say a woman was forced to abort seven months into her pregnancy because she failed to pay a hefty fine for exceeding china 's strict " one-child population control policy , " the bbc reports . according to afp , feng jianmei and her husband had opposed the one-child policy , which bans abortions . " this is a serious violation of the national population and family planning commission 's policies , " says a provincial government official . the shaanxi province , which is investigating the case , says it has expressed opposition to china 's one-child policy and has caused uneasiness in society . the country 's government says it 's " basically true " that the woman 's corpse were posted online , but it 's not clear whether the case will be taken against the perpetrators . the afp reports that the government has been investigating the incident , which occurred in north china last year , when it was jailed for bringing to light hundreds of forced abortions . the bbc notes that china has n't commented on the case . " we make no secret that the united states strongly oppose all aspects of china â€™ s strict abortion laws , " a spokesperson for the national institutes of health says .
