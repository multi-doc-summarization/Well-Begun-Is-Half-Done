" the roman archdiocese of marion county , which is owned by a private company , says it is " outraged and appalled that this material could be included in medical waste received at our facility , " reports the national post . " we don â€™ t want to exclude all human tissue , but we want to draw the line somewhere , " she says . " this is a disrespectful way to dispose of remains. . " the plant 's burns 500 megawatts of solid waste from fetal tissue to general electric waste , the guardian reports . it 's not clear how much the tissue will be distributed to the public , but the company says it wo n't be able to bar any future shipments from the plant , which has been in the works for 30 years . " we do not know this practice was occurring until the end of the alleged practice , " says a spokesman for the marion county medical center . " we did not know what to do . "
