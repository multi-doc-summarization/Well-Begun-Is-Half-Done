a new study out of the university of texas suggests that the virus may have been responsible for the ebola virus , but it 's not clear whether it 's a virus or a virus . the study looked at the interplay between the virus and ebola , and found that those who had n't been exposed to the disease had been more likely to die prematurely , reports the los angeles times . the researchers looked at more than 100 people who had been infected with the virus , and the researchers found that the number of people who died in the study did n't seem to be linked to ebola . " the findings suggest that there is a link between ebola and the disease , " says the lead researcher . " this is not the first time the virus has been transmitted to humans . " the researchers say that while the study reinforces the point of how the virus is transmitted , it does n't matter how many people are infected with ebola , the study finds . the study also looked at a range of factors , including fever , diarrhea , and diarrhea , among other things , the accumulation of infection rates in the brain and the effects of infection , the researchers write . the researchers also found the correlation between the two groups that have been linked to the virus . the study , which looked at data from the usgs and the nih , is based on a number of factors that could be used to predict the virus progresses , the guardian reports .
