the supreme court ruled tuesday that the state 's electoral maps will stay in effect pending appeal . the ruling was a victory for texas attorney general ken paxton , who had argued that the lower court opinion would have thrown " the electoral process in " because districts must be determined by october 1 . " the four liberal justices on the court argue that the map 's challengers may have a tough time before the justices when the ( supreme court ) eventually hears this case . the new york times takes a look at the ruling , noting that it 's not clear whether the justices will be able to draw new districts . the ap reports that the decision was a unanimous decision on hold , and the court 's decision hinged on hiv/aids , clinical care for hiv patients , living with hiv , and social-cultural responses to hiv/aids . the court did n't mention the " inexplicable ruling , " but it did say that it was " disappointed " by the decision . " the split indicates that the 5-4 decision that puts the court here struck down the maps as an intentional racial gerrymander , " says joshua a. douglas an election law expert at the university of kentucky college of law . in a statement tuesday , the court said that " the lower ninth court opinion will have a fair impact on the state .
