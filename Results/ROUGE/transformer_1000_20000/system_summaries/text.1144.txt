the supreme court has ruled that aereo violated aereo 's point of view , the new york times reports . according to the wall street journal , the video was released tuesday by the federal government , which is expected to be released tuesday . " that 's physically impossible , not just because antennas are n't sensitive enough to detect signals from outside the local market but because the world is n't , you know , flat . and that sounds so much like what a [ cable ] tv system does , " the court said in a statement , per the guardian . it 's not clear whether the video will be used to be used as a metaphor for the speech itself , but it 's still a long way from the court to review its arguments . " we have no idea what the court should be disturbed by a question like that . at stake here is the degree to which companies are going to have to do in the cloud what they can do , " says stephen breyer , who says he does n't have the authority to do so . he says he 's not sure what he 's talking about , but he does say it 's time to do that . " i do n't think it 's going to happen , " he says . " it 's a matter of time . " the video , which has been viewed more than 100 times as of this writing , does n't appear to be the final word yet on whether aereo 's music will be able to " pick up every television signal in the world and send it ... into a person 's computer .
