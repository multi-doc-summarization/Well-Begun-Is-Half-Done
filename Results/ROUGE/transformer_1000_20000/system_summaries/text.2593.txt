miami dolphins offensive coach jim turner has been relieved of his duties following the release of ted wells ' independent investigation , the ap reports . " the language and behavior outlined in the ted wells report are against the core values of our organization , " dolphins owner stephen ross said in a statement . " after receiving the report , i conducted my own internal review of the facts to determine the appropriate steps for our organization . jim turner and kevin o'neill are good people who care a great deal about their profession and the players whom they serve , but both exhibited poor judgment at times which led me to this conclusion . as owner , i know firsthand of the high-character and dedicated professionals in our building . i believe in our team and know the hard work and sacrifices they make every day on the field and in the community . however , this is an opportunity and a teaching moment not only for the coaches , staff and players in our locker room , but also for participants throughout sports . " since i first arrived in miami , it has been my goal to have a team which honors our proud tradition and represents our fan base the right way to reach his full potential , " ross added . he added that the coach 's name was " disappointing and unacceptable . "
