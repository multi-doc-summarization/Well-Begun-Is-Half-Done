michael cohen , a surfer from clovelly , was dragged from the sea by friends who were with him at lunchtime today when he was attacked by a shark , the telegraph reports . " i ran up the beach when i saw the splashing in the water and the paramedics were just strapping him up . one of his legs was off totally and the other one was hanging and very badly damaged . he couldn ’ t say the word shark , he just kept saying , 'it took me under , ' " she says . " i was telling him to keep his eyes open , to stay awake and focus on me. ” the shark , who was wearing a diabetic tag , had been seen in the area 90 minutes prior to the attack , but the shark was still in critical condition . “ he was very interested in sharks and respected them , but never took any notice of our warnings . if he wanted to swim , he swam , ” says a fish hoek . “ we warned him often that he was taking a risk , but he always said 'if a shark takes me , then blame me , not the shark . ”
