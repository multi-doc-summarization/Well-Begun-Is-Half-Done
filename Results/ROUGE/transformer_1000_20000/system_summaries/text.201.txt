the space station is backtracking on a report from the space policy institute on wednesday , and the new york times takes a look at what 's going on : " the only exception is the " operational international space station , " says the editorial board . " it 's not the end of the russian space program . " the editorial , penned by michael o'brien , calls the memo " way too harsh , " and notes that it 's " unlikely that the us will be able to get its hands on russia . " but the gist of what 's behind it is , the times notes , is that russia has suspended its own contacts with russia over the past few years . in a statement , nasa says it will " continue to evaluate the situation in the future . " the times reports that russia 's foreign minister , ricardo rossello , says the memo is a " cordial and productive " and " constructive " conversation . " we are not going to be a big deal , " he says . " but we do n't want to do anything about it . "
