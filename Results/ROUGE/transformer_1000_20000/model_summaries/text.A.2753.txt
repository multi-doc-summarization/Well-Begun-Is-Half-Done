might john kerry 's offhand comment lead to a genuine resolution of the syrian mess ? some of the opinions : it 's a 'sham ' : that 's the view of michael doran of the brookings institution as quoted in the washington post . " this is a dishonest ploy by russia and syria that boxes in the unites states and , more importantly , makes any relief for syria ’ s civil war far less likely , " writes max fisher , summing up doran 's view . the worst part is that president obama must now rely on vladimir putin and bashar al-assad . " he is their partner in this sham process , " says doran . later , he asks : " when we rush to embrace rivals and enemies , what signal does that send , around the middle east , about our resolve and reliability ? " worth pursuing : be skeptical , yes , but the us " should pursue this potential solution , " write the editors at the new york times . done right—which means requiring assad to allow monitors in immediately—this " could mean that the united states would not have to go it alone in standing firm against the syrian regime . and it could open up a broader channel to a political settlement between mr. assad and the rebels—the only practical way to end this war . " desperate times : " it is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident , promoted by parties who have regularly lied , and cautiously embraced by a us administration whose policies in syria have been incoherent by any measure , " writes david rothkopf at cnn . " regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not , it speaks volumes about how bad our options are . " hail putin : it 's putin , not obama , who deserves the nobel peace prize , writes kt mcfarland at fox news , who expects obama to take full credit for the proposal when he speaks tonight . " it turns out that leading from behind left a big opening up front . putin stepped right in . and obama still has n't figured it out . "
