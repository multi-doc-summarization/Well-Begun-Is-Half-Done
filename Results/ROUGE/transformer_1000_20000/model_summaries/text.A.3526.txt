sean hannity is n't just feuding with glenn beck , apparently . twitter was in awe wednesday when the fox news host slammed fellow host megyn kelly with " what he might consider the worst insult imaginable , " per usa today : he accused her of " clearly " supporting hillary clinton . earlier wednesday on the kelly file , kelly had criticized donald trump for avoiding tough interviews . " donald trump , with all due respect to my friend at 10pm , will go on hannity , and pretty much only hannity , and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days , " kelly said . however , she also made the exact same criticism of clinton . citing the democrat 's appearance on entertainment tonight on wednesday , kelly said clinton ensures " she is not in a place where she feels uncomfortable or anything unexpected could come at her . " it is n't clear if hannity saw the whole kelly segment . in what mediaite calls " christmas day for media twitter , " several journalists freaked out . " whoa . did hannity really tweet this ? " tweeted cnn 's brian stelter . " fox news seems like a healthy , functional place these days , " said david a. graham of the atlantic , while keith olbermann added , " thanks for the entertainment @ seanhannity # passpopcorn . " kelly has yet to respond .
