it 's close but no cigar for british airways . the airline has fully restored all its long-haul services out of heathrow following saturday 's crippling it failure , but monday marks the third day of related delays and cancellations , particularly when it comes to short-haul flights . the ap reports ba axed 27 flights on monday , and sister airlines iberia and air nostrum cancelled more than 320 . the airline did n't offer much in the way of details until monday when in an interview with sky news , ceo alex cruz faulted a power surge . the independent reports cruz also said the backup system did n't kick in as it should have . cruz brushed away a british union 's assertions that the root of the it issue stretches back a year , when " hundreds " of it staffers lost their jobs , per the union gmb , with the work outsourced to india . cruz countered that " they 've all been local issues around a local data center who have been managed and fixed by local resources . " but that does n't stop the bbc from speculating that for ba 's " disaster recovery plan " to have worked , " veteran staff with knowledge of the complex patchwork of systems built up over the years " would be key , and it 's possible some of those people left during last year 's shift to india . gmb is n't the only one needling the airline . mashable reports budget airline ryanair has been poking fun on twitter . in one tweet , it proclaims , " breaking news : ba appoints new head of it ... . # shouldhaveflownryanair " ; the picture above features the line " computer says no . " see its other tweet here .
