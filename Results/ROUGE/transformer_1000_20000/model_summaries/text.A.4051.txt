while many people were unwrapping gifts on christmas day , the brother-in-law of tennis star andy murray was wrapping up a 700-mile , 38-day journey through brutally cold temps and blistering windsâ€”and , he hopes , setting a world record . scott sears , 27 , reached the south pole on monday , and he says he 's the youngest person ever to do so solo , though guinness has yet to offer its final seal of approval , the bbc notes . " merry christmas from the south pole ! absolutely chuffed to pieces , " he wrote on his blog , where he documented his unassisted adventure , which included temperatures of minus 58 degrees and wind gusts of up to 150mph . sears said he was so tired when he finally took a rest after his trek that he fell asleep " within about 2 minutes of my head hitting the mat . " sears , whose sister , kim , is married to the tennis star , describes a grueling expedition with icy , crevasse-marred terrain and an isolation made worse when the " ipod poltergeist " would occasionally strike , causing his music player to stop working . he says he " truly hit a wall " on christmas eve , where " everything was just saying 'no more , not one more step . ' " but he devoured some dried meat , juice , and chocolate and pushed through , even hanging up his stinky socks as " makeshift stockings " for santa that night . sears ' message from andy murray 's mom once he arrived at his destination : " well done scott sears . " if guinness confirms sears ' feat , he 'll be three years younger than the previous record-holder , per the telegraph . ( prince harry drank champagne out of a prosthetic leg when he arrived at the south pole . )
