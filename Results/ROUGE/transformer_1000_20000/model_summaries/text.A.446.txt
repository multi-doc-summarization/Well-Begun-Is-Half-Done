iran 's president-elect hassan rouhani has begun delivering his message of moderation , calling upon the country 's leaders and clergy to stop meddling so much in the private affairs of its citizens . " a strong government does not mean a government that interferes and intervenes in all affairs . it is not a government that limits the lives of people , " he said in an address on state tv , reuters reports . rouhani has criticized the country 's internet filtering , and chastised state broadcaster irib for ignoring important issues . " when irib airs the birth of a panda in china but nothing about unpaid workers protesting , it is obvious that the people and youth will ignore it , " he reportedly tweeted . rouhani has also spoken out against enforcement of the country 's islamic dress code , saying he does n't support religious police cracking down on loose clothing and hairstylesâ€”though he did n't go so far as to say the dress code should end , reports the guardian . " if a woman or a man does not comply with our rules for clothing , his or her virtue should not come under question , " he told a magazine . " in my view , many women in our society who do not respect our hijab laws are virtuous . our emphasis should be on the virtue . " he also says he opposes the segregation of men and women , criticizing politicians who want to ban women from entering soccer stadiums alongside men .
