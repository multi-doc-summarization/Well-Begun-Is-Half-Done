does prayer have the power to help recovering alcoholics squash temptation ? a small new study out of the nyu langone medical center finds that at least among 20 long-term alcoholics anonymous members who reported no cravings in the week leading up to the test , prayer reduced cravings that arose when shown images of alcoholic drinks or people drinking . to perform the tests , the researchers report in the american journal of drug and alcohol abuse , participants were asked to read the newspaper or pray after being shown the images . participants reported some craving following seeing the images , but less so after having prayed , while mri data showed changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex that controls attention as well as in regions thought to control emotion . " this finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional response to alcohol triggers , but that it â€™ s experienced and understood differently when someone has the protection of the aa experience , " says senior author marc galanter , who published a book on alcoholics anonymous earlier this year . he goes on to suggest that the reduction in cravings in aa members correlates to the amount of time that has elapsed since one 's so-called " spiritual awakening , " which aa describes as taking a different attitude toward drinking . in previous research , participants asked to pray every day for four weeks drank about half as much as those who were not . ( see why some have been challenging the 75-year hegemony of aa . )
