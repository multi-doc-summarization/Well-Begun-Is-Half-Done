it looks like george zimmerman has sold his gun after all . both tmz and wkmg report an online auction that ended wednesday received a verified top bid of $ 120,000 for the weapon used to kill trayvon martin . a higher bid of nearly $ 140,000 by " john smith " appeared to be bogus . in fact , wkmg reports that auction site united gun group actually had two auctions goingâ€”a fake one open to the public destined to attract pranksters like " john smith , " and a closed one made up of pre-qualified bidders . " i would like to thank and give the glory to god for a successful auction that has raised funds for several worthy causes , " zimmerman said in a statement addressed to " fellow patriots . " the trayvon martin foundation declined to comment . ugg tweeted that zimmerman is " in the process of vetting several offers and verifying funds , " adding , " our part in this process is over and we are going to get back to business as usual . " the site , though , is taking plenty of heat for facilitating the auction . " i hope you enjoy your time with the devil in hell , " reads a representative tweet . zimmerman 's efforts to auction the 9mm pistol have not gone smoothly . another site , gunbroker.com , backed out . and the fiirst attempt attracted several joke bids , such as the $ 65 million offered by " weedlord bonerhitler . " ( in a recent interview , an unrepentant zimmerman said martin 's mother and father were bad parents who " did n't raise their son right . " )
