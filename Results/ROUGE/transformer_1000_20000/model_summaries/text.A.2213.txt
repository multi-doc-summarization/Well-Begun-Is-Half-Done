a few twitter users lost the coveted blue tick on wednesday after twitter released new guidelines regarding verified accounts . the move came after the company was attacked for granting verified status to jason kessler , who put together the white nationalist rally that rocked charlottesville in august ( and issued this " vile " tweet about victim heather heyer ) . in a series of tweets , twitter explained that " verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice ... [ but ] verification has long been perceived as an endorsement . we gave verified accounts visual prominence on the service which deepened this perception . we should have addressed this earlier but did not prioritize the work as we should have . " general verification requests had been put on ice as of nov. 9 pending a review of the program , and the guardian reports that twitter 's new policy specifies that accounts that promote hate , support hate groups , or harass users will see verification revoked . among those to immediately lose the check , per the washington post , were kessler , white nationalist richard spencer , and far-right activist laura loomer ( known for rushing the stage during julius caesar and being banned from uber and lyft after anti-muslim tweets ) . loomer 's response to her notice of verification removal including tweeting " translation : i 'm a conservative " and , per splinter , comparing her situation to that of jews during the holocaust .
