morgan freeman says this could " undermine " everything he 's done . on friday , the 80-year-old actor issued a personal defense of his behavior with women , saying he 's kidded around with female colleagues but never jeopardized work environments or offered jobs for sex , the la times reports . " i am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined , in the blink of an eye , by thursday â€™ s media reports , " freeman says in a statement . " all victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard . and we need to listen to them . but it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor . " freeman is likely referring to recent entertainment tonight footage of him sitting down with female interviewers . in one instance , he asks a correspondent if she was married and " fooled around with other guys . " in another , with author/activist janet mock , he marvels at how she " got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips , and ... cross [ ed ] your legs . " for mock , this was " an exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them , including women 's bodies . " but freeman says he only wanted women to " feel appreciated and at ease around me . as a part of that , i would often try to joke with and compliment women , in what i thought was a lighthearted and humorous way . " see his initial apology here .
