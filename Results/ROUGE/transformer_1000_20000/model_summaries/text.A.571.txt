the press statement 's title— " achieving parity in diplomatic missions " —may seem bland , but the message from the state department is anything but : it explains the united states has ordered russia to close a consulate in san francisco and diplomatic annexes in new york and washington by saturday . the new york times frames the moves as an " expected ... tit-for-tat response " after russia forced a cut in us embassy staff in late july . indeed , the ap notes secretary of state rex tillerson had said the us would respond by september . " we believe [ russia 's ] action was unwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries , " and the trump administration is making the move " in the spirit of parity invoked by the russians , " per the statement . once the closures are complete , each country will have three operating consulates remaining . the remainder of the statement : " while there will continue to be a disparity in the number of diplomatic and consular annexes , we have chosen to allow the russian government to maintain some of its annexes in an effort to arrest the downward spiral in our relationship . the united states hopes that , having moved toward the russian federation 's desire for parity , we can avoid further retaliatory actions by both sides and move forward to achieve the stated goal of both of our presidents : improved relations between our two countries and increased cooperation on areas of mutual concern . the united states is prepared to take further action as necessary and as warranted .
