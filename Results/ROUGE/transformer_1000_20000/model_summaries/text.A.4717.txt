belgian doctors accused of improperly euthanizing a woman with autism will see their case go to trial , marking " the first time that there has been a decision to refer such a case to a court of law " since the practice was legalized in 2002 , a prosecutor tells the afp . three doctors from east flanders are being investigated on suspicion of having " poisoned " tine nys in 2010 . the 38-year-old had been diagnosed with asperger 's syndrome two months before she died in an apparently legal killing by a doctor . sophie nys , one of tine 's sisters , told the ap of " irregularities " in the process : that the doctor who performed the euthanasia asked her parents to hold the needle in place while he administered the fatal injection , among other fumbling efforts . afterward , the doctor asked the family to use a stethoscope to confirm that tine 's heart had stopped . last year , the ap reported that after nys ' family filed a criminal complaint , her doctors attempted to block the investigation . " we must try to stop these people , " wrote dr. lieve thienpont , the psychiatrist who approved nys ' request to die—and one of the doctors now facing charges . " it is a seriously dysfunctional , wounded , traumatized family with very little empathy and respect for others . " nys also alleged that her sister 's longtime psychiatrist would n't give tine the ok , and that thienpoint did so after as few as two or three sessions with her . belgium is one of two countries , along with the netherlands , where euthanasia of people for psychiatric reasons—including depression , personality disorder and asperger's—is allowed if they can prove they have " unbearable and untreatable " suffering .
