after five years of tracking saint nick , google and norad are going their separate ways . the north american aerospace defense command announced this week that it was now working with microsoft bing to follow santa 's worldwide progress , the guardian reports . google has launched its own " santa tracker " including games and personalized calls from saint nick to children . but norad 's tracking system will be no slouch , with data on santa 's elevation , photos of his journey , weather , and wikipedia information on his various stops . and norad will offer updates on santa 's trip via twitter and youtube . twenty-five million people will likely use norad 's tracker this year via bing maps and apps for windows 8 , windows phones , and android phones , reports business insider . norad began tracking santa when a misprint in a 1955 department store ad led a child to call the agency for information on santa 's latest stop . the norad employee who took the call made sure to answer , and the agency has maintained the tradition ever since .
