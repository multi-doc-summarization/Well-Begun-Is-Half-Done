" so far , at least 10 hoverboard fires have been reported in nine states , per fox59 , and the guardian reports that 88 % of the non-eu hoverboards tested by the uk 's trading standards authority did n't pass basic safety requirements . the verge notes that the problem has become so worrisome that some airlines are now banning hoverboards from their flights . " criminals and irresponsible manufacturers will often exploit high demand and attempt to flood the market with cheap and dangerous products , " the ceo of the chartered trading standards institute tells the guardian . one company that may end up profiting from the other sites ' reluctance to carry hoverboards : ebay , which ecommercebytes.com notes still had plenty of listings for the product as of sunday night .
