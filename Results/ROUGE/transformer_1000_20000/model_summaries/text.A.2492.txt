the family of an unarmed black motorist shot in the back by a south carolina police officer has been given a settlement that lawyers say is " historic " â€”and the biggest in recent cases of its kind . north charleston 's city council voted unanimously on thursday to settle with walter scott 's family for $ 6.5 million , the new york times reports . a city attorney tells the post and courier that they 're proud they could " settle a case of this magnitude without a brick being thrown , without a fire being set , and without a lawsuit being filed . " he says the city took the $ 6.4 million settlement in the freddie gray case and the $ 5.9 million settlement in the eric garner case into account during negotiations . as part of the settlement , scott 's family has agreed not to sue the city or its employees , the times notes . the city lawyer says that while the payment is large , there was the potential for " a very large verdict " if the case went to court because there 's video of the shooting and former officer michael slager has been charged with murder . " it 's historic , " an attorney for the scott family tells the washington post . " it sets a good precedent for a city not tolerating this sort of behavior from police officers . " anthony scott , walter scott 's brother , says the settlement ensures that scott 's four children will be taken care of financially , and a portion of it will be donated to the red cross to help flood victims in the state , the post and courier reports . ( slager is in jail awaiting trial for the april 4 shooting , and he says video of the incident does n't tell the whole story . )
