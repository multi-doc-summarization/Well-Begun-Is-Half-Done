not a big fan of southern california ? neither is northern california , apparently . supervisors in rural siskiyou county voted 4-1 tuesday in favor of seceding from the state , reports the times-standard . the county thinks state officials in sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own—to be called jefferson . supporters want to invite other northern counties , and perhaps a few from oregon , to join , too , notes the los angeles times . ” we have to have government that 's local , understands our issues , and has empathy , ” says one local rancher . it 's clearly a very long-shot bid , one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the us congress . still , neighboring humboldt county is expected to meet soon to consider the idea . ( meanwhile , some counties in colorado want to form a new state of their own . )
