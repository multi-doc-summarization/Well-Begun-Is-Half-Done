it 's been a nearly 200-year-long debate : did william shakespeare add 325 lines to thomas kyd ’ s the spanish tragedy nearly a decade after kyd 's death ? none other than samuel taylor coleridge raised the question in 1833 , and a 2012 computer analysis seemed to lend credence to the theory . now , a university of texas professor says the proof may be in the handwriting—and bad handwriting at that . in a paper to be published next month , douglas bruster compares the play 's 1602 " additional passages " with a three-page handwriting sample believed to be the bard 's held at the british library . what he found , per the new york times and ut at austin news : about two dozen similar spelling patterns ( for instance , " sorow for " sorrow " ; past-tense words that ended in " t " , like " wrapt " ; and one word spelled two ways , like " allie " and " allye " for " alley " ) and nine textual " corruptions " that he believes resulted from the printer misreading shakespeare 's hand . he also thinks an awkward passage—so seemingly poorly written that it has been cited as evidence the lines could n't have been crafted by shakespeare—is the result of another bad handwriting/printer error goof . says bruster , " this is the clinching evidence we need to admit the additional passages into the shakespeare canon . " the times notes this would mark the first such addition since passages from edward iii ( also attributed to kyd ) were included in scholarly editions in the mid-'90s . ( another fascinating recent study paints shakespeare as a food hoarder . )
