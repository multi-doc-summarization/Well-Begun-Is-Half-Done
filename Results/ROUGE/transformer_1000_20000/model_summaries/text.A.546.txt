florida international university 's pi kappa alpha fraternity apparently did n't get the memo that social media is n't the place to go shopping for drugs . the frat has been suspended after its private facebook page was made public via an anonymous email that included screenshots of 70 posts—some looking to buy or sell cocaine and the prescription stimulant adderall—was sent to university administrators and the media , the miami herald reports . among the posts the herald obtained : " anyone have a connect for coke , not me , a friends wants , lol " ( response : " is diet ok ? " ) . and that was n't the half of it : other posts featured images of topless women , one described as being 17 ; boasts of hazing ; digs at overweight women ; and gay slurs . another especially tasteless post : " guys please put up the pike prays for boston banner that ’ s upstairs outside so that when people start arriving tomorrow morning they see it . this is excellent publicity ! " fiu is looking into whether its code of conduct was violated , and campus police have been looped in . it 's certainly not the chapter 's first offense—past indiscretions include egging a rival frat and painting obscenities on a student 's car . nor is it the frat 's first headline-grabbing headache : last year 22 pi kappa alpha members at northern illinois university were charged in a pledge 's death ; it 's also the frat that was involved in the university of tennessee 's infamous butt-chugging incident .
