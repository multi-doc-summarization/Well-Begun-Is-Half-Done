there ’ s no need to panic about japanese markets post-earthquake , says warren buffett : such cataclysmic events often create a “ buying opportunity , ” he tells reuters from south korea . “ it will take some time to rebuild , ” but the market plunge “ will not change the economic future of japan. ” put it this way : “ if i owned japanese stocks , i would certainly not be selling them. ” a hong kong investor agrees : “ i saw lots of buying last week by overseas investors , ” notes the asian equities boss . “ i tend to agree with mr. buffett for the long term . i suppose the economy will be weaker over the short term but reconstruction spending will eventually help. ” and there will be plenty of that : the world bank today said it expected the 5-year reconstruction effort to cost as much as $ 235 billion . shares of japan ’ s top home construction firm have already skyrocketed , the new york times reports .
