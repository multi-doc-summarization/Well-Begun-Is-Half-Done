in a move that stunned many republicans , democratic leaders announced wednesday night that they had reached a deal with president trump to protect dreamers from deportation in return for funding extra border securityâ€”but not a wall . senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi announced the deal after a white house dinner , the ap reports . " we agreed to enshrine the protections of daca into law quickly , and to work out a package of border security , excluding the wall , that 's acceptable to both sides , " they said in a joint statement . a source says the deal also includes a pathway to citizenship for the almost 800,000 young immigrants involved . white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders tweeted that daca and border security were discussed at the meeting , though " excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to , " the los angeles times reports . this is the second time in two weeks that trump has bypassed republicans to cut a deal with democrats and immigration hardliners are furious over what they see as an amnesty , the washington post reports . if reports of the deal are true , trump 's " base is blown up , destroyed , irreparable , and disillusioned beyond repair , " said gop rep. steve king . " no promise is credible . " breitbart.com called the deal a " full-fledged cave " and dubbed the president " amnesty don . "
