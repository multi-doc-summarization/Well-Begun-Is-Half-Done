after downing a cheeseburger and a handful of drinks sunday evening , paul rater called home and ordered his wife to come get him , the maricopa county sheriff 's office says , per the arizona republic . but instead of his wife showing up at the south buckeye equestrian center , the cops didâ€”and hauled him into a maricopa county jail on child endangerment and abuse charges for allegedly leaving his 5-year-old granddaughter alone in the desert with a peculiar and perilous set of instructions . " she was given [ a ] gun and told to shoot any bad guys , " sheriff joe arpaio tells reuters . " i do n't know how a 5-year-old can tell a good guy from a bad guy , but that 's what she said she was told . " deputies say the girl had been reported missing about four hours after she went out sunday afternoon with her grandpa in his pickup truck . it 's unclear whether the truck broke down or somehow became stuck ; rater says he did n't have his cellphone on him , could n't call for help , and started walking . the 53-year-old says his granddaughter started to complain she could n't go further , so he left her under a tree with a .45-caliber handgun that was both loaded and cocked , per reuters . an off-duty firefighter and the girl 's grandmother found her during a frantic search ; she was holding the weapon with " one round in the chamber and the hammer locked back , " per a police statement . workers at the equestrian center ( a bar/restaurant/feed store ) say when rater arrived he did gripe about having to walk out of the desert but made no reference to the girl . " he came across multiple people and never thought he should call 911 , " deputies say in the statement . bond for rater was set at $ 25,000 on monday , per kpho . the girl has been returned to her mother , abc15 notes .
