it 's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era , and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day . that would be aug. 28 , 2005 , one day before hurricane katrina devastated new orleans . national weather service meteorologist robert ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax , writes meteorologist james spann in a tweet commemorating the ricks forecast . as it turns out , ricks was spot on . " most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer , " he wrote . " at least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure . all gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed . " and this : " water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards . " ( spann 's tweet includes the full text . ) the forecast has been credited with saving lives , and it is now in the smithsonian museum of american history , as noted by slate on the 10-year anniversary . ricks told brian williams of nbc news on sept. 15 , 2005 , that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public . he ended up removing nothing . " i would much rather have been wrong in this one , " he told williams . " i would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf . but our local expertise said otherwise . you know , 'hey , let 's gear up for the big one , this is going to be the big one . ' " ( read about what jj watt 's crowdsourced fundraiser accomplished in the wake of hurricane harvey . )
