fed up with working moms getting all the perks , 38-year-old magazine editor meghann foye writes in the new york post that it 's time for childless women to start getting theirs . " there ’ s something about saying ' i need to go pick up my child ' as a reason to leave the office on time that has far more gravitas than , say , 'my best friend just got ghosted by her okcupid date and needs a margarita'—but both sides are valid , " she says . but foye has bigger fish to fry than working moms getting to leave work on time . she 's advocating for " meternity leave " to balance out the maternity leave given to new moms . she defines meternity leave as " a sabbatical-like break that allows women and , to a lesser degree , men to shift their focus to the part of their lives that doesn ’ t revolve around their jobs . " foye says a meternity leave would allow childless women to get the time to refocus and reevaluate their lives—time that is already afforded to new mothers . foye actually took a meternity leave for herself and says the experience was invaluable . " i may not have been changing diapers , but i grappled with self-doubt for the year and a half that i spent away from the corporate world , " she writes . obviously , foye 's opinion has been controversial . " i have to laugh pretty hard at a foye ’ s description of maternity leave as a 'sabbatical-like break , ' " writes mary elizabeth williams at salon . " it ’ s not exactly a vacation , " concurs korin miller at women 's health magazine . " you 're up every three hours to nurse . ... if you can squeeze in a five-minute shower , it 's pretty much a damn miracle . " and laura june at new york magazine points out only 13 % of new moms in the us even get maternity leave .
