when an australian ship heard pings possibly from malaysia airlines flight 370 , officials saw a big lead open up in the searchâ€”but since then , investigators have n't been able to recapture the signal , reuters reports . that 's particularly worrying since the batteries on the jet 's black boxes have likely just about run out . but " we need to continue ( searching ) for several days right up to the point at which there 's absolutely no doubt that the batteries will have expired , " says angus houston , the australian official leading the search , per cbs news . " if we do n't get any further transmissions , we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long , long time , " houston says . the ship is carrying an autonomous underwater vehicle that can search the depths for the plane , " literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean , " houston notes . trouble is , findings so far point to " a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search . " once the vehicle , called bluefin-21 , does head downward , it will conduct 20-hour sonar missions to try to find the plane .
