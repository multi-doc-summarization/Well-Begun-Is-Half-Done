president trump may not have had the biggest inauguration crowd in history , but he may have made a bigger fuss about media coverage of it than any of his predecessors . sources tell the washington post and cnn that on saturday morning—the first morning of his presidency—trump contacted michael t. reynolds , the national park service 's acting director , to demand more photos of the crowd on the national mall . reynolds , who has worked for the service for 30 years , was " taken aback " by the request , but he sent some aerial photos to trump , according to the post 's sources . the photos did not , however , provide proof of trump 's claim that more than a million people had gathered to watch his inauguration . reynolds and the nps have declined to comment , but insiders say trump also expressed anger over an nps tweet comparing his crowd to obama 's , which apparently led to an order for all interior department accounts to stop tweeting . white house deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders confirmed that trump contacted the nps . she said the call demonstrated the president is " so accessible , and constantly in touch . " " he 's not somebody who sits around and waits . he takes action and gets things done , " she said . " that 's one of the reasons that he is president today , and hillary clinton is n't . " ( trump was still talking about the size of his inaugural crowd on wednesday , when he gave his first interview as president . )
