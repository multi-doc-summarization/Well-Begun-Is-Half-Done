republican rick scott declared himself the victor in tuesday 's florida race for a us senate seat , but it looks like people may have to bite their nails on this one a little longer . politico reports that the team of his democratic opponent , incumbent sen. bill nelson , sent out an early morning statement noting the vote tally was " not the result senator nelson and his campaign had worked so hard for . " but the campaign also said that statement did n't mean nelson was conceding , and later wednesday morning came another statement from nelson 's camp : " we are proceeding to a recount . " per wesh , scott 's lead was 38,717 votes out of more than 8 million castâ€”which comes out to a margin that 's less than one-half of 1 % . in florida , once the margin dips below that benchmark , a recount is automatically triggered . state officials will reportedly order the recount on saturday . scott , currently the governor of florida , reacted via his spokesman , per politico : " this race is over . it 's a sad way for bill nelson to end his career . he is desperately trying to hold onto something that no longer exists .
