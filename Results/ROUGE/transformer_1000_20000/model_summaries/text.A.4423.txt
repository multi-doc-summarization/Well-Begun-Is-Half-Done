for tens of thousands of years , the secrets of france 's bruniquel cave went unknown , its mouth closed off by a rock slide . that began to change in the late '80s , the atlantic reports , when a boy named bruno kowalsczewski started clearing away what obstructed the opening ; three years later , in 1990 , the then-15-year-old 's 100-foot path allowed local cavers entry . one caver made it more than 1,000 feet in and found something wild : two stone rings up to 16 inches high intentionally made from pieces of chopped-up stalagmites ( pillar-shaped mineral deposits that stick up from the ground ) , probably by neanderthals some 176,500 years ago , scientists now say . a press release notes " until now the oldest formally proven cave use dated back only 38,000 years . " while previous research had suggested the structures predated the arrival of modern humans in europe around 45,000 years ago , the ap reports the notion that neanderthals could have made them did n't fit long-held assumptions that these early humans were incapable of the kind of complex behavior necessary to work underground . " their presence at [ 1,102 feet ] from the entrance of the cave indicates that humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment , which can be considered a major step in human modernity , " the researchers concluded in a study published online wednesday by the journal nature . the authors said the purpose of the oval structures—measuring 172 square feet and 25 square feet—is still a matter of speculation , though they may have served some symbolic or ritual purpose .
