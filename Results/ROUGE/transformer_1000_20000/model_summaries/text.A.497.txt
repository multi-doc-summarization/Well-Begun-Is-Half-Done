amazon ceo jeff bezos sent out his annual letter to shareholders this week , and business insider takes note of one part in particular about the company 's " pay to quit " program . amazon offers some employees up to $ 5,000 to leave , and bezos explains that the principle is " pretty simple " : " once a year , we offer to pay our associates to quit . the first year the offer is made , it ’ s for $ 2,000 . then it goes up one thousand dollars a year until it reaches $ 5,000 . the headline on the offer is 'please don ’ t take this offer . ' we hope they don ’ t take the offer ; we want them to stay . why do we make this offer ? the goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want . in the long-run , an employee staying somewhere they don ’ t want to be isn ’ t healthy for the employee or the company . " the tennessean fills in some gaps : the offer is good only for employees in the company 's " fulfillment centers " —the warehouses where all those online orders get packed and shipped . a spokeswoman tells the paper that only a " small percentage of employees take the offer . " the huffington post , meanwhile , notes that many of those warehouse workers are part-timers , and it 's unclear whether they would qualify for the deal . still , it 's an interesting idea , writes max nisen at quartz , and it shows how bezos is n't afraid to experiment to improve his workforce .
