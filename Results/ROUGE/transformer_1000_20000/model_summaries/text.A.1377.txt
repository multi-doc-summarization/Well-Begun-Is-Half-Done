dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers . a new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore did n't roar , contrary to every dinosaur movie you 've ever seen . instead , they made a decidedly less scary sound called a " closed-mouth vocalization . " think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing . as the scientists explain in the journal evolution , per ut news , the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch . in fact , the animal 's mouth is shut the whole time . lots of birds do this today , and because birds descended from dinosaurs , scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way . the fossil record ca n't prove it , though the washington post notes that previous research meshes with the idea , including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords . “ a cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times , ” says the lead author . “ that suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays " among different types of animals . a co-author says the study gives the impression of " a very different jurassic world . not only were dinosaurs feathered , but they may have had bulging necks and made booming , closed-mouth sounds . " but if so , the makers of jurassic park did n't get it all wrong : the hiss of the film 's velociraptors came from a goose , per vulture . ( scientists have grown chickens with dinosaur legs . )
