a dutch report on the mh17 crash concludes the plane was shot down by a russian-made buk surface-to-air missile that struck the front left side of the plane near the cockpit , dutch safety board chairman tjibbe joustra said at a press conference on tuesday . the report , the result of a 15-month-long investigation , notes the explosion sent thousands of metal objects in all directions and hundreds hit the plane with " tremendous force , " joustra said , per the guardian . he added shrapnel from the buk missile was found inside the bodies of the pilots , who died instantly , along with traces of paint from a buk missile . the bbc 's anna holligan , who spoke to relatives briefed on the report , says all passengers and crew would 've lost consciousness immediately as the plane broke apart in the air . a 65-foot reconstruction of a portion of the plane , revealed at the press conference , showed holes perforating the upper part of the cockpit , according to reporter luke harding . " we ca n't be 100 % sure " that no one suffered , " but we 've got to sort of think that was the case , " a relative says . the report mainly focuses on the cause of the crash and avoids " blame and culpability " ; a separate criminal investigation will point fingers , reports afp . the report at least rejects moscow 's claim that the boeing 777 was downed by a missile fired by ukrainian troops on july 17 , 2014 , on a flight from amsterdam to kuala lumpur . but about 30 minutes before the report 's release , moscow had dismissed it . " it 's always special when people already know that they do n't agree with a report that 's not even published yet , " joustra said .
