after a woman wound up in the hospital in the uk last year after ingesting a medley of herbs for a new year 's " detox , " doctors are issuing a warning : there is such a thing as too much water , and people need to be careful with supplements , even if they are all-natural herbs . in this case , the 47-year-old woman said that aside from mood issues she was healthy when she upped her fluids and use of herbal remedies , including milk thistle , molkosan , l-theanine , glutamine , vitamin b compound , vervain , sage tea , green tea , and valerian root . doctors in september reported in the british medical journal case reports that she suffered from acute severe " hyponatremia , " which occurs when there is abnormally low sodium in one 's blood . she had gone to the er after suffering a seizure . most cases of hyponatremia occur after someone consumes a ton of water—more than 2.5 gallons in a day—but this woman 's fluid intake was n't that high . then , a possible clue : doctors found a similar case of a man with the same condition who also had n't hit that intake level but had ingested valerian root . the doctors note that two case studies are insufficient evidence , but suggest it 's possible the root " altered this threshold [ of fluid intake ] , allowing severe hyponatremia to develop at an earlier stage . " the british dietetic association tells the bbc that the whole notion of detoxing is without merit , as many of our organs ( even our skin ) regularly detoxify the body . it may sound less sexy , but they add that for most people " a sensible diet and regular physical activity " is best . ( experts are also rolling their eyes at the souping trend . )
