if your idea of a perfect halloween involves spending the night with 6 million dead people , airbnb has just the thing . it 's offering up a free night in the catacombs of paris on oct. 31 to the person who submits the best essay here . the winner will get a private concert in what time calls " basically the world 's biggest grave , " a fancy dinner , and the apparent honor of becoming " the only living person to wake up " in the catacombs , according to the contest . one guest is allowed . airbnb reportedly paid about $ 400,000 for the privilege of privatizing the site for the night , reports afp . “ before bedtime , a storyteller will have you spellbound with fascinating tales from the catacombs , guaranteed to produce nightmares , " says the contest . the catacombs of paris , a labyrinth of tunnels set up to relieve cemetery overcrowding in the 18th century , are now a public museum , notes upi—and a major tourist attraction . the airbnb rules ask guests to " respect the catacombs as you would your own grave . " the contest deadline is oct. 20 . ( in the us , a woman 's halloween decorations outside her home were apparently a little too realistic . )
