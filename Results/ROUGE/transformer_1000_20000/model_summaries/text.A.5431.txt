red bull gives you wings , and if you 're an islamic militant , apparently , extra stamina to keep fighting . turkish traders are shipping the energy drink and other items into syria across borders that are controlled by rebels belonging to isis , the free syrian army , and the islamic front , and business is apparently booming : according to trade stats out of ankara , turkey sent $ 1.3 billion in goods to syria through september , its highest total for a nine-month period ever recorded , bloomberg reports . those who wield power over the border—and right now that 's militants in at least three border towns—are the ones who reap the profits , pocketing tolls and fees from transporters . while turkish customs and economy officials either would n't comment or did n't respond to bloomberg , the owner of a turkish trucking company said that " every day we have four or five trucks carrying red bulls to syria . " he adds that those picking up the goods on the syrian side do n't id themselves , and the imports are then loaded onto syrian trucks and driven away . meanwhile , caffeinated militants may also be fortified by the " good wives of jihadi " : the independent recently documented a new isis media arm that posts and tweets out nursing , morale , and cooking advice for militants ' wives , including recipes to " replenish the mujahidin . " ( here 's how you can get your portion of a $ 13 million red bull payout . )
