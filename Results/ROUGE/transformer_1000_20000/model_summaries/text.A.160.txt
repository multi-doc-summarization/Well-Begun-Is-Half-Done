a lot of people in thailand have apparently discovered that they do n't have enough black clothing in their wardrobes for a full year of mourning . vendors across the country are struggling to cope with a surge in demand for black clothes after the death of king bhumibol adulyadej , and government officials have told inspectors to watch out for traders trying to profit from the beloved monarch 's death with price-gouging , reports the bangkok post , which , like other thai newspapers and tv stations , is eschewing color images during the mourning period . white is also a traditional color of mourning in the buddhist country . " regarding black shirts which have become more expensive , the commerce ministry has sent teams to inspect white and black clothing vendors to make sure the shirts are not being sold at prices that are too expensive , " a government spokesman says . a nurse shopping for black clothes in bangkok tells reuters that prices have gone up , but that is n't a major concern right now . " if you compare , the price is higher than before , but this is n't about prices , " she says . " we 're going to wear them for a year . "
