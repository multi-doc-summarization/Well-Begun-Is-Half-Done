the internet loves obsessing over game of thrones , so hello giggles wants to know why more people are n't talking about the fact that " tommen is also his own cousin . " dean-charles chapman currently plays king tommen baratheon on the show , a role he took over from a younger actor in 2014 . but he also played tommen 's cousin , martyn lannister , in a few episodes of the show back in the third season , mashable explains . hello giggles thinks the recasting makes complete sense . “ given the lannister family ’ s penchant for incest , having several people in that lineage look the same ( like exactly the same ) would not be a surprise. ” poor martyn was killed off after being taken hostage by robb stark , and bustle thinks chapman better hope for a third role as tommen is " probably doomed just like his look-alike cousin .
