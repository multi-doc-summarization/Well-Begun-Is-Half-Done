sisters nia and lahtifa wilson were headed home from a family gathering sunday night when the unthinkable happened : police say 27-year-old paroled felon john lee cowell fatally stabbed 18-year-old nia in a " prison-style attack " on an oakland train station platform ; her 26-year-old sister was injured . police have framed the attack as random , though many have speculated over whether there was racial motivation involved . and in the aftermath of nia 's death , a national conversation has emerged around race that has reeled in some big-name celebs and brought a thoughtful post from anne hathaway that 's generating headlines . the timeline : outrage erupted and f-bombs got lobbed over oakland news station ktvu 's coverage of wilson 's death . its report featured a photo of wilson from her facebook page ; in it , she appears to be holding a gun . the daily dot notes wilson 's page featured " tens of other photos " that could have been used in place of that image . many said the choice fueled a larger trend involving the criminalization of black victims . and it was n't even a gun . as shaun king explains in a lengthy facebook post , it was just a cell-phone case with a gun handle , " basically a gag– and the local news showed it like it said something about nia ’ s character . ... even in death , local news media finds a way to demean us .
