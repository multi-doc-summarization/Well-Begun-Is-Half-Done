not only did anthony weiner lose his own seat , he might have lost it for his party—in a very democratic district , no less . republican bob turner leads democrat david weprin by 47 % to 41 % , with 7 % still undecided , public policy polling finds . turner ’ s got a 32-point lead among independents , and he ’ s even got 29 % of democrats behind him , leaving weprin with less than 60 % support in his own party . the poll ties turner ’ s success to anti-obama sentiment in the area , but the race is also taking a turn for the nasty : thinkprogress reports that the gop blanketed the district with a flier portraying a mosque rising from the ashes of ground zero , alongside images of weprin and obama , with weprin quoted as saying , " i support the right of the mosque to build . " meanwhile , politico leaked details of a nasty 1986 custody battle between weprin and his ex-wife , in which weprin is described as " heedless " of his toddler 's son 's welfare . and while weprin is " something ( well ) short of a star candidate , " writes chris cillizza at the washington post , the whole race could soon be a moot point : many expect the district to disappear in redistricting .
