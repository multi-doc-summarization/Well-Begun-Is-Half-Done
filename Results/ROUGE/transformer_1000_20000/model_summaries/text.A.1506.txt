batten disease , a rare and fatal genetic brain disease marked by blindness , seizures , dementia , and loss of motor skills , gained attention earlier this year when hollywood producer gordon gray and his wife kristen learned that both their young daughters have it , reported deadline in june . now another california couple , bekah and danny bowman of orange county , have learned that not just their 5-year-old son titus but also their 2-year-old son ely have the disease , reports people . " the amount of publicity from the grays has been a silver lining in the midst of tragedy , " says bekah , noting that they decided to share their story after watching the grays , who are trying to raise $ 10 million to $ 12 million in a race to help find a cure , go public with their own struggle . worries about speech and mobility issues and seizures led to titus ' diagnosis in april . because the disease is genetic , there was a 25 % chance his little brother would have it . ely took a test in june , and the family 's worst fears were confirmed . both boys have late-infantile cln2 and will face dramatic declines before dying young . titus is already suffering the effects . " when we got the diagnosis , [ titus ] was still talking , walking and eating , " bekah says . " within a month ... he lost all of those abilities . he 's blind , he can not walk anymore , he 's in a wheelchair , he 's eating through a gj tube and he does n't talk anymore . " still , the bowmans are finding a way to be thankful for every day they have with their boys . bekah had this to say in an april blog post : " this week i ’ ve become broken . more broken than i knew i could be . so broken that i can ’ t fix it and i ’ m overcome by it . but ... out of the broken comes love . an authentic , new eye-opening kind of love . " a gofundme campaign has been started for the family . ( this rare disease could turn this boy into a mannequin . )
