sleeping with contacts in or forgetting to swap in a new pair according to schedule may be the unintended result of a harried lifestyle , but it could also lead to long-term eye damage , a new cdc study reports . researchers looked at 1,075 cases of eye infections reported to an fda medical device database over a 10-year period ending in 2015 , and of those infections , almost 20 % of them ended up causing more serious eye injuries , a cdc release reports . those injuries ranged from scarred corneas and cornea transplants to other forms of vision problems . and of those who reported infections , the issue was bad enough for more than 10 % of them to go to the er or an urgent-care clinic for treatment . yet most people do n't give a second thought to the perfunctory way in which they handle their contacts , a lenox hill hospital ophthalmologist tells webmd . " unfortunately , many of the 41 million contact lens users in the united states do not think of a contact lens as a medical device they are placing on the surface of their eye , " dr. mark fromer says . in addition to replacing contacts as recommended , users should also follow other recommendations from the american optometric association to keep eyes healthy , per cbs news , including not sharing contacts with anyone , not using tap water to clean contacts , and no snoozing with them in , which the cdc says can raise the risk of an eye infection between six to eight times . ( and then there are the eyeball-devouring amoebas . )
