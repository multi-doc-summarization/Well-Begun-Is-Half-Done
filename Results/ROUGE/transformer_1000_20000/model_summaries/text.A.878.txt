did a now-viral video of a man punching a kangaroo come out of australia ? yes , of course . should we be judging him for it ? it depends on how you feel about dogs . the video , which has amassed more than 4.1 million views so far , was first posted on facebook saturday by steven stubenrauch , who said he got it from a buddy from down under . but while the shot to the 'roo 's face is indeed cringeworthy , mashable explains there 's a " saga behind it , " and it 's " very intense . " the man in the video , ided by news.com.au as greig tonkins—nicknamed " goo , " meaning this fight could be deemed " goo vs. 'roo , " as ninenews.com.au astutely notes—was part of a hunting trip in june for a friend named kailem , who was in bad shape from cancer and wanted desperately to go on a boar-hunting trip with friends . and so mathew amor invited kailem and some other friends , including tonkins ( who it turns out is a zookeeper ) , to his new south wales property for the hunt , and while they were gallivanting about , the featured kangaroo reached out , grabbed tonkins ' dog max , and put the pup in a headlock . and so tonkins jumped into action , throwing the punch now seen 'round the world . everyone turned out to be fine : amor says max was startled but ok , the kangaroo was simply " stunned , " and tonkins came away unscathed because he did n't throw that hard of a punch . " it was funny because the guy who did it is the most placid bloke , " amor says . " we laughed at him for chucking such a s -- - punch . " sadly , kailem died last week , but amor says he 'd " be looking down from up there [ heaven ] and laughing because it was the highlight of the trip . " ( a cyclist says a kangaroo ruined her breast implants . )
