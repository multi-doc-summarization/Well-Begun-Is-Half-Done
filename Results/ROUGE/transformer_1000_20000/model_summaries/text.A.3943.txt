looks like the " complete meltdown of humanity " in aleppo will continue for at least another day . the ceasefire declared in the war-ravaged syrian city tuesday appears , to nobody 's surprise , to have broken down , leaving tens of thousands of civilians in rebel-held areas stranded in desperate conditions . reuters reports that a planned evacuation has stalled amid fierce fighting and what rebels say is a resumption of airstrikes by russian-backed syrian government forces . buses that were supposed to evacuate fighters and civilians to rebel-held areas outside the city returned to their depots wednesday morning , the ap reports . activists say iran-backed militias and syrian government forces blocked the evacuation after demanding that the russia- and turkey-brokered deal be changed to allow the evacuation of their own injured fighters from towns in rebel-held zones , reports the bbc . " the sectarian militias want to resume the massacre in aleppo and the world has to act to prevent this sectarian slaughter led by iran , " a member of rebel group noureddine zinkitells the guardian . " the opposition will continue to abide by the agreement . " russia , which claims thousands of civilians and hundreds of fighters left the remaining rebel-held portion of aleppo over the last 24 hours , says syrian forces are responding to rebel attacks , and they expect resistance to end over the next two or three days .
