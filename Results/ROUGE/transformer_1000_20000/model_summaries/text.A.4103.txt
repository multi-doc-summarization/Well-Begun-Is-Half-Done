tim kaine 's youngest son probably would n't have gotten arrested had his dad fared better in the november election , and not exactly because of the privilege of the vice presidency : the pioneer press reports that six people were arrested or cited saturday at a " march 4 trump " rally of about 400 in st. paul , minn. , and 24-year-old linwood michael kaine was one of them . the younger kaine was arrested on suspicion of second-degree rioting at the state capitol , where cops say a group of 50 or so anti-trump protesters raised a ruckus by blaring air horns , being verbally disruptive , setting off fireworks , and even a smoke bomb that reportedly hit a 61-year-old woman in the head when it was thrown into the crowd . a st. paul police rep says " some force " was needed to haul " woody " kaine to the ramsey county jail . he was n't charged , nor were the others , though the st. paul city attorney is looking into whether any misdemeanors are warranted . kaine was released tuesday morning while the case is further investigated . per wcco , the minnesota republican party put out a statement monday blaming democrats for " coordinating disruption and violence " both during the election and afterward . the senator , meanwhile , issued his own statement to the press , noting he and his wife " love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues , " adding his kids know well how to " express those concerns peacefully . " ( tim kaine once ran for his senate seat against a cat . )
