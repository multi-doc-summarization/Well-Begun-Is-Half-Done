soon-to-be-former cia director john brennan strongly criticized donald trump on sunday for reckless tweeting and for failing to understand the threat from russia—and the president-elect took to his communication medium of choice to react . " 'outgoing cia chief , john brennan , blasts pres-elect trump on russia threat . does not fully understand , ' " trump tweeted , quoting a fox headline . " oh really , could n't do much worse - just look at syria ( red line ) , crimea , ukraine and the build-up of russian nukes . not good ! was this the leaker of fake news ? " trump wondered . in an earlier tweet about the russia dossier , trump said intelligence chiefs and the media should " apologize " for making " a mistake . " brennan had told fox news sunday that trump needs to be a lot more disciplined about his " talking and tweeting " when he becomes president , the hill reports . " spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests and so therefore when he speaks or when he reacts , just make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the united states could be profound , " he said . brennan—who leaves office friday , along with other obama administration officials—also warned trump against " absolving russia of various actions that it 's taken in the past number of years " and said it was " outrageous " that trump had compared the intelligence community to nazi germany , the bbc reports . ( trump also tweeted criticism of saturday night live after the " really bad " show 's latest portrayal of him . )
