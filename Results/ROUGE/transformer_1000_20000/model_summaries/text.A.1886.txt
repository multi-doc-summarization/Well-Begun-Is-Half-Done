" i 'm going to go on camera and say george is not a racist " are words that frank taaffe now regrets saying about former pal george zimmerman . just two years ago , when the media frenzy was at a fever pitch following the shooting death of trayvon martin , taaffe made an aggressive showing in front of the cameras , defending his neighbor and saying " [ zimmerman ] became the victim , " as reported by news 13 . now , as a grand jury hears a case this week to decide whether zimmerman will face federal charges for violating trayvon 's civil rights , taaffe—who testified before the grand jury yesterday—is saying that zimmerman was probably in the wrong and just might be a racist after all , based on a mysterious phone call he received shortly after martin 's death , raw story reports . taaffe did n't recognize the number , and the caller , who said his name was " george , " made a racially charged comment about martin , taaffe says . at first taaffe thought it was a prank— " people knew my phone number , so it could 've been anybody , " he tells wftv . he 's not sure if it was zimmerman , but he finally told investigators about it in june to make " amends to the martin family " after his own two children and a brother died recently , and to mend things with his surviving child , who was " ostracized " for his zimmerman advocacy . ( taaffe 's somewhat-confusing explanation of all this is shown in the video here . ) he now thinks zimmerman racially profiled trayvon , saying , " in my heart of hearts , i do believe that . " even more bizarre : his own reported racist rantings and criminal rap sheet , according to a 2013 mother jones article .
