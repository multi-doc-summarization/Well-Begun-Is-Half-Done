more than $ 1 million has been raised in the name of donald trump by a pac—but zero dollars appear to have gone to help the gop nominee , and donors are furious with the " registered genius " and " grape soda connoisseur " behind the setup , politico reports . ian hawes is the 25-year-old behind dinnerwithtrump.org , a site not affiliated with trump 's campaign and that offers an exciting opportunity , if you 're a trump fan : a chance to win tickets to a trump " fundraising event , " complete with flight and hotel stay . that contest site , in addition to other fundraising efforts hawes has made—including nearly $ 110,000 in facebook ads , per federal records—has so far brought in $ 1.1 million from more than 21,000 donors , hawes says . the issue : donors say they thought this fundraising effort was part of trump 's campaign , though the fine print on the site notes it 's simply giving away two tickets to a " sponsor-selected fundraising evening event " with trump in attendance . " i feel ripped off and taken advantage of . … this is robbery , " says one donor who ponied up $ 256 to hawes ' american horizons pac , thinking she was donating directly to trump 's camp . hawes denies he 's pulling one over on anyone , noting that interested parties can enter the dinner contest without donating—though politico notes a " double your chances " promotion is offered via multiple entries if someone contributes—and that the pac will refund donations to anyone who asks for one . plus , he adds , trump 's campaign has never told him to cease and desist using trump 's name . the " dinner with the donald " site is n't hawes ' only moneymaker scheme : he 's also launched crookedhillary2016.org— " to fight crooked hillary 's campaign of lies " —and has registered imwithtrump.org , though that 's not live yet . ( the real trump was closing the fundraising gap with clinton earlier this month . )
