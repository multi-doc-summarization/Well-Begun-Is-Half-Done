tarek el moussa , the co-host of hgtv 's real estate and renovation show flip or flop , is in remission after a battle with thyroid cancer and has an observant viewer to thank . back in 2013 , el moussa visited a doctor about a lump that had appeared on his neck , but he was told it was benign . then ryan read , a fan and trained nurse , spotted the growth while watching an episode . " this is not a joke . i 'm a registered nurse . i 've been watching flip or flop . i noticed that the host tarek has a large nodule on his thyroid , and he needs to have it checked out , " she told the show 's production company in an email , per the independent . that email prompted el moussa , then 31 , to get a biopsy , which found he had thyroid cancer and that it had spread to his lymph nodes . el moussa , who hosts flip or flop with his wife , christina , says the pair got to meet read when his case appeared on an episode of the doctors . " we actually ended up spending the day with her , " he says , per entertainment tonight . " it was just such an amazing experience to meet this person , because she stepped up and did what others probably would n't have done . " he adds that without read , he may never have known he had cancer , or " by the time that i would 've found out , it probably would 've been in a much further stage . " el moussa had the tumor removed and underwent thyroid radioactive iodine therapy . now " i feel fantastic , " he tells people . " every day that goes by , the odds of the cancer [ recurring ] decreases , so we 're really excited for that . " ( this dog can also spot thyroid cancer . )
