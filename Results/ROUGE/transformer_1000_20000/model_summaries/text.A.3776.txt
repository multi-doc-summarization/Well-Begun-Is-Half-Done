fox man bill o'reilly is after sandra fluke again , claiming the " committed leftist " who wants him to fund her sex life is at the " center of a campaign to reelect " barack obama . " let me get this straight , ms . fluke , " said o'reilly in an earlier program . " you want me to give you my hard-earned money so you can have sex ? good grief . " in fact , fluke wants her university health insurance ( typically paid for by students ) to cover birth control , as college health plans usually do if they 're not affiliated with the catholic church , notes the huffington post . " i do n't want to pay for sandra fluke 's recreation , " said o'reilly . " this is madness . " because " obamacare mandates that i have to buy health insurance , " my " premiums go up a small amount " to cover female contraception , he noted . he suggested that if fluke wants her " activities " covered by health insurance , then the government should have subsidized his college football uniforms . o'reilly and guest bernie goldberg rehashed their views yesterday , with goldberg characterizing fluke as the " poster person for the entitlement society . " at least they did n't use the s word .
