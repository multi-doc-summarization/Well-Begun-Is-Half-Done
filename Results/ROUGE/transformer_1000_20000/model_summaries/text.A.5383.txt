in 2013 , after edward snowden dropped his nsa bombshell , president obama called for an end to spying on certain world leaders . but benjamin netanyahu and other israeli bigwigs remained on the " keep an eye on " list for " compelling national security " reasons , current and ex-us officials tell the wall street journal . included in the us spying sweep were conversations between israeli officials and us lawmakers and american-jewish groups , which , as one senior us official tells the paper , resulted in an " oh s -- - moment " that the executive branch would be nailed for spying on congress . the white house , though , felt the info necessary to rebut lobbying netanyahu might do against a us-iran deal ; still , it was " wary of a paper trail stemming from a request . " and so " we did n't say , 'do it ' [ to the nsa ] , " a senior us official tells the journal . " we did n't say , 'do n't do it . ' " instead , the administration more or less let the nsa share whatever info it saw fit , and the nsa did just that , reportedly following tight mandates about spying on communications " to , from , or about " americans , the paper notes . for example , the agency took out names of individual lawmakers and any personal info in reports it submitted to the white house and also omitted any " trash talk " about the administration , officials tell the journal . at least one presidential candidate is n't surprised by the revelations . " this administration views congress , republicans , and sometimes even democratic members of congress as their enemy , " ted cruz tells cbs news . " at times , it seems like they view the american people as their enemy . " a national security council spokesman , however , tells cbs , " [ w ] e do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific and validated national security purpose . this applies to ordinary citizens and world leaders alike .
