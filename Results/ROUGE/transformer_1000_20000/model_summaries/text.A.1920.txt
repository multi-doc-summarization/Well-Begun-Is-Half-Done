president obama asked white house lawyers last month to come up with ways to reform the national security administration 's phone-surveillance program and they have delivered four options , insiders tell the wall street journal . one option—and probably the least likely to be adopted—is scrapping the program altogether , while the other three involve taking the vast amount of phone data currently being gathered out of the nsa 's hands . sources say the director of national intelligence and the justice department have presented obama with the following options for shifting the phone data : having phone companies retain the data . under this option , the nsa would contact phone companies when it needed specific searches of phone records . telecommunications firms , however , are firmly opposed to this plan . having another government agency retain the data . the fbi has been spoken of as a possibility for this role , though the foreign intelligence surveillance court is also being considered . having a non-government , non-phone company agency retain the data . this option is also seen as unlikely . privacy groups say any such agency would become a mere extension of the nsa . obama said last month that any such third party would be carrying out " what is essentially a government function with more expense , more legal ambiguity , and a doubtful impact on public confidence that their privacy is being protected , " the wire notes .
