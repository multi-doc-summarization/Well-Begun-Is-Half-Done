millions of people pay for the privilege of leaving their shoes and belts on and their laptops in their bags during airport security screenings . but a study out of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign says by making the tsa 's precheck program free—it 's currently $ 85 for the regular background check and a five-year membership—lines will be made shorter , the tsa will save money , and everyone 's life will be a whole lot easier at our congested airports , the los angeles times reports . the problem is hitting the sweet spot of having enough travelers going through the expedited precheck lines to justify the cost expended on staffing those dedicated lines . the original goal by this point was to have 25 million signees in the program and others like it ( such as customs and border protection 's $ 100 global entry program ) , but by may , per bloomberg , not even half that number had come aboard . the study published in the journal of transportation security checks out different scenarios to see which would end up paying off for both the tsa and consumers , per a release . although getting rid of the five-year fee of $ 85 for 25 million travelers would result in losing $ 425 million a year , if every traveler who signed up went through precheck at least six times a year , the cost savings would amount to $ 459 million annually from decreased staff and equipment costs—a net savings of $ 34 million per year . " it will facilitate more people going through checkpoints more quickly , make the system more secure , and produce a cost savings for the tsa , " sheldon jacobson , the study 's lead author , says in the release . " it 's a win-win-win situation . " a noted drawback : if the fee were waived only for frequent fliers , occasional travelers might be miffed at having to pay , as would those already paid up .
