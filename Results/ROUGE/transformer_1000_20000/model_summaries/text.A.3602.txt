with the rise of sharing breast milk , a disturbing new study finds that 72 % of samples bought online contained bacteria that could cause infections and 21 % contained viruses . in 74 % of the 101 samples purchased anonymously from two popular websites , the total bacteria count was significantly higher than the level generally considered safe . bacteria found included e. coli , staphylococcus , streptococcus , and even salmonella , the wall street journal reports . the fda does not regulate the breast milk market , though it discourages sharing , the new york times reports . breast milk can be sold or donated on dozens of websites , and while some suppliers hand off the milk in person , others ship it . problems during collection ( improper hand-washing , dirty breast pumps or containers ) , improper storage ( 19 % of the samples in the study were not cooled ) , and long shipping times ( some of the samples took as long as six days to arrive ) likely contributed to the health hazards . another potential problem : researchers say they are " a little suspicious of some of the milk , " and are now working to determine if it 's authentic breast milk , usa today reports . in response to the study , at least one site that sells milk will stop allowing mothers to purchase from other mothers ; donors will instead sell to a company that processes breast milk .
