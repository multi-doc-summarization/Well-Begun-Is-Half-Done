the white house fence-jumper was an " absolutely inexcusable " security breach , and politico reports that peter king wasted no time today in calling for a " full investigation into what happened , why it happened and what needs to be done to make sure it never happens again . " the new york republican wants to bring the matter before his homeland security committee , because , he says , while the president may face " a lot of very complex assassination plots , " friday 's breach represents " the most basic , the most simple type of procedure and how anyone especially in the days of ( isis ) can actually get into the white house without being stopped is inexcusable . " elsewhere on your sunday dial : robert gates on isis : i think that destroying ( isis ) is a very ambitious mission . i think our goal ought to be pushing ( isis ) back out of iraq , denying them a place where they can have a permanent foothold . we ’ ve been at war with al-qaeda for 13 years , we haven ’ t destroyed it . " tony blair on isis : " the president is absolutely right to take on ( isis ) and to build the broadest possible coalition . he and secretary kerry have put together about 50 countries now in this coalition . we ’ ve got absolutely no choice but to do this and not just in order to destroy the onward march of ( isis ) but to send a very strong signal to the other terrorist groups operating in the region . we intend to take action and see it though . " dianne feinstein on violence and the nfl : " i think i can speak for all of the women in the senate when i say we are very surprised , amazed and very resolute to do something about it . there is no place for this . period . i believe very strongly that if a player is arrested , he should be suspended , and if they ’ re convicted , that ends it . i know there are contracts . this is gone on too long , and this is getting too bad . these teams need to set an example for the rest of society .
