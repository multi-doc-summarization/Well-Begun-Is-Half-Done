president obama today began his campaign to convince congress to back his iran nuclear deal with a major speech in which he characterized the upcoming vote as one about war or peace . if the deal falls through , opponents can expect a likely outcome , he said at american university : “ another war in the middle east. ” obama added that “ i am not saying this to be provocative , ” reports the washington post . “ i am stating a fact ... the choice we have is some kind of war , maybe not tomorrow , maybe not in three months , but soon. ” in the speech , obama also drew a parallel with the vote to authorize the iraq war . “ many of the same people who made the case for war with iraq ” oppose the iran deal , he said . they need to “ worry less about being labeled weak [ and ] worry more about getting it right , " because that war " did more to strengthen iran and more to isolate the united states than anything we have done in the decade since , " reports politico . the iraq message seems to be aimed at democrats who voted in favor of the war and now regret it , because obama will need their votes to sustain any veto , reports usa today . the speech kicks off " a campaign of private entreaties and public advocacy over the next several weeks " to win approval of the deal , notes the new york times .
