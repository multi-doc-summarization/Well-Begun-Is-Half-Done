a san francisco official looks to be the first public figure in the country to " come out of the prep closet , " as he puts it in a piece for the huffington post . scott wiener—who represents a district he calls " ground zero for the hiv epidemic " —says he takes the daily antiviral pill truvada to lower his risk of contracting hiv . he 's urging other gay men to do the same . " a much larger segment of gay men should be taking a close look " at what 's known as pre-exposure prophylaxis , wiener tells the new york times . truvada as prep has been very slow to catch on across the country , which wiener writes sees 50,000 new hiv infections each year . researchers say prep could reduce the risk of hiv infection by up to 99 % if taken as prescribed . the world health organization made a similar case to wiener 's this summer , but the san francisco chronicle calls wiener 's announcement " significant because so few people have been willing to talk openly about their use of truvada . " though the drug 's list price is just over $ 1,000 a month , wiener says prep is covered by most health insurers ( he personally pays $ 15 a month ) . for the uninsured or those with high-deductible plans , however , the price can be a problem . wiener 's colleague , david campos , says he will ask the city 's health department to develop a strategy that " addresses the educational and affordability issues " by december . " we have to start somewhere , " says campos , who adds that every prevented infection saves $ 355,000 in treatment costs .
