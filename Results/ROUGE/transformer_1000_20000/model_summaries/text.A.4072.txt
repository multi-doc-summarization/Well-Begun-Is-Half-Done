president trump 's longtime personal driver says the billionaire exploited him in an " utterly callous display of unwarranted privilege and entitlement . " noel cintron is suing the trump organization , claiming he was stiffed for around 3,300 hours in overtime over six years and did n't receive a " meaningful " raise for more than a decade , tmz reports . the 59-year-old says he joined the trump organization more than 30 years ago and served as trump 's chauffeur for around 20 years until the secret service took over in 2016 . he says he worked at least 50 hours a week but was paid a flat yearly salary , which rose to $ 75,000 in 2010 , instead of time-and-a-half for overtime as required under new york law , reports the washington post . cintron—whose lawyer says he is still employed by the trump organization—is seeking more than $ 200,000 in compensation for overtime worked over six years , which is as far back as his lawsuit can go under the statute of limitations , bloomberg reports . according to his lawsuit , on one of the few occasions he received a raise , cintron ended up losing money because the organization forced him to give up his health benefits . his lawsuit slams trump for his " callousness and cupidity . " the trump organization says it will fight the lawsuit . cintron " was at all times paid generously and in accordance with the law , " a spokeswoman said in a statement . " once the facts come out we expect to be fully vindicated in court . "
