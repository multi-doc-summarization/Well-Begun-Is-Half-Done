natalie portman managed to get married very , very quietly saturdayâ€”but details are now trickling out about the big sur ceremony , which celebrated the backgrounds of both portman ( jewish ) and new hubby benjamin millepied ( french ) . the couple married under a jewish chuppah overlooking the ocean , wore a jewish prayer shawl during the ceremony , and ended by smashing the traditional glass as guests cheered , " mazel tov ! " they also danced the hora as a klezmer band played , people notes ( later , in keeping with natalie 's tastes , the dj busted into some hip-hop until 2:30am ) . guests ate french macarons instead of cake , and left with wildflower seed packets inscribed with " merci . " those macarons must have been made without eggs , because the entire menu was vegan , in keeping with portman 's diet . the couple also used indigenous wildflowers rather than flying any flowers in for the ceremony , and even natalie 's rodarte gown had a " hippie " feel , a source tells in touch . it was tea-length with full sleeves and " not overly showy or revealing , " the insider says . portman wore wildflowers in her hair and millepied donned a blue tux . the 60 to 100 guests included ivanka trump , macaulay culkin , diane sawyer , and rashida jones ( but not , notably , mila kunis ) . click to see pictures of an absolutely beaming portman on her big day .
