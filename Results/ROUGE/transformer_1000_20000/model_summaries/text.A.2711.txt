bill cosby was labeled a " violent sexual predator " by the judge who sentenced him to three to 10 years in prison on tuesday , but his publicist had a different description : one of the " greatest civil rights leaders " in history and one of the " greatest educators of men and boys . " outside the courtroom in norristown , pa. , publicist andrew wyatt claimed the 81-year-old cosby had faced the " most racist and sexist trial " in american history , the new york times reports . wyatt claimed that three psychologists who testified against cosby in the sexual assault trial were trying to " make money off of accusing black men of being sexual predators . " he also read a statement from camille cosby , the disgraced entertainer 's wife , alleging that an audio recording played in the trial had been doctored . wyatt , who previously called cosby 's trial a " public lynching , " accused judge steven o'neill of being part of a " sex war " and linked the sentencing to the treatment of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh . vox reports that the strangest moment came when wyatt likened his client to jesus . " they persecuted jesus , and look what happened , " he said . " not saying mr. cosby is jesus , but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries . " cosby , who left the montgomery county courthouse in handcuffs , spent his first night behind bars at sci phoenix , a state prison that opened two months ago in suburban philadelphia , reports wpvi .
