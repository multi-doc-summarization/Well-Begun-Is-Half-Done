think you look better in your latest selfie than in real life ? then beware of " snapchat dysmorphia , " a newly dubbed term for people seeking plastic surgery to mimic their appearance in filtered selfies , the san francisco chronicle reports . " sometimes i have patients who say , ' i want every single spot gone , and i want it gone by this week or i want it gone tomorrow , ' because that 's what this filtered photograph gave them , " dermatologist neelam vashi tells the washington post . " they check off one thing , and it 's gone . that 's not realistic . i ca n't do that . " researchers say the fixation may be a new version of body dysmorphic disorder ( or bdd ) , a mental ailment that makes people obsess over any perceived flaw in their appearance . a 2017 survey of plastic surgeons first spotted the trend , which is fueled by photo-filtering and editing technology once available only to celebrities . " this is an alarming trend because those filtered selfies often present an unattainable look and are blurring the line of reality and fantasy for these patients , " according to an article in the jama medical journal co-written by vashi . what 's more , bdd is a serious mental disorder that can require cognitive behavioral therapy and medicationâ€”and lead to suicidal thoughts in 80 % of sufferers , per a 2007 study . just seeing an unfiltered image of oneself " can bring feelings of sadness " for some people , says vashi , " and then if one really develops this disorder , that sadness clearly progresses to something that can be dangerous and alarming .
