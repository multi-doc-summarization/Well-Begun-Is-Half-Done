when taylor swift heard that naomi , one of her young fans , had to miss her concert because she had been diagnosed with cancer , swift jumped onto naomi 's gofundme page and promptly donated $ 50,000 , people reports . " to the beautiful and brave naomi , i 'm sorry you have to miss [ my concert ] , but there will always be more concerts , " she wrote . " let 's focus on getting you feeling better . " but because the site caps donations at $ 15,000 , the singer had to carry out four separate transactions—a limit that 's now been lifted after gofundme got word of taylor 's gesture . " taylor swift 's donation was so generous that it required us to increase the donation limit on the platform , " ceo rob solomon said in a release , noting that now the max users can give in one pop is $ 50,000 . he adds that swift has given more to various gofundme campaigns than any other donor in the site 's history . as for how naomi felt about her idol 's donation—well , you can see her reaction in this video . ( taylor recently got apple to bow down before her , too . )
