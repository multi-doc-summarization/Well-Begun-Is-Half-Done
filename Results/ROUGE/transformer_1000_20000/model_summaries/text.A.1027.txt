the door was locked around 8:40am yesterday when a few students arrived at jillian jacobson 's photography classroom at el dorado high school in placentia , calif. " that 's not normal for that hour of the day , " a police lieutenant explains to the orange county register . the students found another teacher to open the door and were met with a horrific scene : jacobson , 31 , hanged from the ceiling . a student in the other teacher 's class says they could hear " screaming , crying , " and their teacher yelling , " oh my god , oh my god ! " after the door was opened . that teacher and jacobson 's students lowered jacobson to the floor , and paramedics tried to revive her , but she was pronounced dead at the scene , the los angeles times reports . jacobson was a popular teacherâ€”and her own father had committed suicide , according to several students who say it was not uncommon for jacobson to speak out against such an action , advising students that " suicide was not the answer , " as ktla puts it . no suicide note was found , but the preliminary investigation indicates she did take her own life , the lieutenant says . " she gave no signs of being depressed or sad , " says one of her former students . another student at the school , one of many who mourned jacobson on twitter , said she remembered the teacher often " really brightened up everyone 's day . " but others say she was struggling with " personal issues . " the students who found jacobson were taken to crisis counselors immediately , and grief counselors were made available at the school .
