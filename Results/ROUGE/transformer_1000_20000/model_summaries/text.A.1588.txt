popular figure skater gracie gold is taking time off from her sport " to seek some professional help , " she announced in a statement friday . gold is a two-time us figure skating champion , was a member of the 2014 us olympic team that won the bronze medal , and is an expected member of the 2018 us olympic team , per the washington post . but she has been on what usa today calls " a precipitous and alarming 17-month-long slide " since she fell from first place to fourth at the 2016 world championships ; she continued to flail at competitions , and in appearances this spring and summer , she found it difficult to land simple jumps . she ultimately finished sixth at the 2017 national championships , missing this year 's world championships . her statement does not specify what sort of help she 's seeking but only mentions " recent struggles on and off the ice . " the 22-year-old has spoken in the past about her struggles with her weight , saying last october that she did n't currently have the " lean body " required for her sport . longtime us olympic coach frank carroll coached gold for four seasons , but the two " abruptly " split after the 2017 national championships ; he tells usa today he wonders " what happened " to gold 's " joie de vivre " and hopes she " can find happiness . " her announcement comes four months before the 2018 us olympic figure skating trials ; gold will skip the japan open on oct. 7 but said in her statement she plans to be back in time for her grand prix assignments in china and france in november .
