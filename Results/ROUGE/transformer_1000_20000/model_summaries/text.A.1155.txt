it 's a gruesome way to go : a 30-year-old mother was killed in central china over the weekend when the metal floor panel that sat between the top of a mall escalator and the floor beyond gave way as she and her son exited the escalator . but as the woman , identified as xiang liujuan , fell halfway through , she pushed her toddler son to safety . the south china morning post reports a woman standing nearby caught him , moved him to the side , then managed to briefly grab xiang 's hand . but seconds later she was gone , pulled in by the machinery . most details come from outlets citing the wuhan evening news , as well as an extremely graphic video of the incident . the hong kong free press reports by way of the evening news that xiang 's entire body was " sucked into " the escalator 's treads . those treads had to be cut in order for her to be removed , in a process that took roughly four hours . her husband was reportedly on the scene ; he had apparently been with his wife and son but had n't gotten on the escalator yet . afp cites an anonymous evening news source who claims work had recently been completed on the escalator and that the maintenance workers failed to properly screw in the access panel . the incident occurred at the anliang department store in jingzhou , hubei province , and public opinion seemed to be split between faulting store management for not immediately turning the escalator off and praising the mother 's dying act of love . ( a woman was killed last year after her scarf and hair became caught in a montreal subway . )
