by now , everyone should know not to get too close to hippos in the wild or in captivity , but a california man did n't get the memo . officials at the los angeles zoo tell the los angeles times they 've recruited the lapd to help look for a most unusual sort of trespasser : a man caught on tape scaling a barrier and slapping one of two hippos in the pen below . the now-viral video , recorded from the other side of the enclosure by what sounds to be a young woman , shows the man slowly climbing over a railing , then reaching down to slap the butt of 4-year-old rosie , who appeared to be snacking alongside her mother , mara . mara looks up briefly , and the person shooting the video can be heard giggling as the man lifts his arms up in an apparent victory stretch and runs off . but zoo officials warn that what happened was anything but funny . " any unauthorized interaction with an animal is unsafe for the animal and potentially unsafe for the patron , " a zoo spokeswoman says , noting something like this also breaks down the animals ' trust that zookeepers have worked so hard to instill . the bbc notes hippos are responsible for more human deaths in africa than any other big animal . the suspect could be hit with a misdemeanor charge or other infraction—california law bars anyone from climbing into zoo enclosures—but the case is being investigated as a trespassing violation , not an animal cruelty one , as the animals did n't seem particularly fazed by the incident .
