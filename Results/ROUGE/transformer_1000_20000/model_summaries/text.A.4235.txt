did you just get caught taking a few minutes to update your fantasy football team or instagram your lunch ? just tell your boss it 's making you a better worker . two researchers from baylor university recently published a study after looking at the break habits of 95 workers to identify a better break . " what we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed , " researcher emily hunter says in a press release . for example , it turns out , midmorning—not afternoon—is the best time for a break . " you should pace yourself , similar to how plants should be watered early in the day before getting distressed from a long day in the sun , " hunter tells the huffington post . second , do n't use the time to run errands . breaks should be composed of an activity you enjoy—even , counterintuitively , if it 's work-related . ( like some kind of " passion project , " in the words of huffpo . ) finally , the researchers found frequent , smaller breaks are ideal over a singular , longer break . " unlike your cellphone , which popular wisdom tells us should be depleted to 0 % before you charge it fully to 100 % , people instead need to charge more frequently throughout the day , " hunter says . while they did n't identify an ideal break length , the huffington post reports previous studies have shown as little as five minutes away from work can improve productivity . by following their advice for better breaks , researchers say employees will experience less mental and physical burnout . ( others say a lunchtime walk will cure your work woes . )
