" we are open for ideas and in talks with interested parties , " who might use the vessel " as a 'green ' luxury yacht . " no plans are brewing to mass-produce the planetsolar—it cost $ 12.5 million—but the project jibes with current thinking in the shipping industry , which is looking for ways to cut back on high fuel costs , notes the new york times .
