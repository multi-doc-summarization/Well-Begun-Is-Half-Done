marco rubio may have been one of the driving forces behind the gang of eight 's immigration reform bill , but that does n't mean he 's planning to vote for it . he told radio host hugh hewitt yesterday that the parts of the bill related to border security need to be strengthened before the bill heads to final senate consideration , because he does n't want the bill to " give overwhelming discretion to the department of homeland security . " and if those amendments are n't made , " then i think we ’ ve got a bill that isn ’ t going to become law , and i think we ’ re wasting our time , " and he would n't support it , rubio said . the washington examiner says such a move would be " an extraordinary turn of events , " since rubio has been the public face of the legislation . byron york does n't understand rubio 's change of heart , since the senate judiciary committee actually did strengthen and expand the security measures when it approved the bill . but rubio could simply be concerned the bill wo n't pass : he also told hewitt there are n't 60 votes in the senate for the bill , and there wo n't be unless the bill is strengthened , because " the majority of our colleagues are prepared to do immigration reform , [ but ] they ’ re only prepared to do it if we ensure that this illegal immigration problem never happens again . "
