the shroud of turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around jesus after his crucifixion ; bloodstains on the linen shroud , which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days jesus was in the tomb , form the image of a crucified man . but a new study reported in the journal of forensic sciences finds the bloodstain image was likely faked . researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up , rather than someone who was flat on the fabric , science alert reports . as the researchers put it , the stains are " totally unrealistic " when compared to what they should look like . the shroud , which is held in the cathedral of st. john the baptist in italy , is considered an icon , as opposed to a genuine religious relic , by the vatican ; fox news notes " the church has never weighed in on its authenticity . " " this is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations , " the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells buzzfeed news . " even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth , which would be fascinating information to have . " the study found inconsistent staining , with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstainsâ€”a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts . another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining , though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood , meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made .
