lishan wang , a chinese doctor charged with murder in connecticut , can be forced to take anti-psychotic medication in order to be competent enough to stand trial , the ap reports . the state supreme court ruled tuesday it would n't be a violation of the mentally ill wang 's rights to forcibly medicate him . as laid out in a 2003 us supreme court ruling , prosecutors had to show it was " substantially likely " the medication would make wang competent to stand trial . a state psychiatrist testified there was a 50 % to 70 % chance of that happening . while wang 's public defender , mark rademacher , argues that does n't meet the threshold , the state supreme court ruled 7-0 that anything greater than 50 % constitutes " substantially likely . " the court also ruled there was n't a " less-intrusive option " to forcibly medicating wang and that he was unlikely to have side effects from the medication , cbs connecticut reports . rademacher may appeal the decision to the us supreme court . " they just set the bar too low before they can violently restrain a patient , knock him out with a sedative , and inject him with medication , " he tells the ap . wang is charged with fatally shooting dr. vajinder toor and shooting at toor 's pregnant wife in 2010 outside their connecticut home . wang was fired from his job in 2008 after multiple confrontations with toor and other doctors . wang maintains that he 's not guilty and does n't need medication .
