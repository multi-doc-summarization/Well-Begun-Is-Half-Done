caitlyn jenner has a new memoir dropping april 25 , and she makes a big announcement in it , people has confirmed : she underwent gender reassignment surgery in january , meaning her physical transformation from male to female is more or less complete . " the surgery was a success , and i feel not only wonderful but liberated , " jenner writes in the secrets of my life , per radar . she had indicated back in 2016 during an i am cait episode that she was n't sure when or if she 'd undergo the procedure , which for a person born male means removing the penis and creating a vagina . she apparently decided to go for it , however , and to tell her fans in the interest of " candor " â€”and so everyone would quit bugging her about whether she 'd had it done or not . " so all of you can stop staring , " she writes . " you want to know , so now you know . which is why this is the first time , and the last time , i will ever speak of it . " she also adds , in typical caitlyn style : " i am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time . " ( so yeah , that " sex change regret " story obviously did n't pan out . )
