add two more senators to the list of gay-marriage " evolvers " â€”north dakota 's heidi heitkamp and indiana 's joe donnelly said today that they support same-sex marriage , reports the huffington post . both are democrats from conservative states and both are safe from re-election campaigns until 2018 . " the makeup of families is changing , but the importance of family is enduring , " said heitkamp in a statement . together with yesterday 's flip by florida 's sen. bill nelson , the moves leave only four democratic senators who have not publicly voiced support for gay marriage . if you 're a bit amazed by how quickly senators have been " evolving " on this issue , you 're not the only one . but nate silver decided to take things a step further , as usual , and try to come up with a mathematical model to explain why , for his latest blog post in the new york times . the key , says silver , is public support for gay marriage in many states growing from a slight majority to a clear one . but he expects the pace to slow down greatly at this point . " the remaining senators who have not taken the opportunity yet may have good political reasons for it , and may wait some time before they do , " he writes .
