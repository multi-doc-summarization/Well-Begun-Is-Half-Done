apparently still smarting from some of chris rock 's oscars barbs , the academy of motion picture arts and sciences invited 683 people—many of them women and minorities—to join in an unprecedented move wednesday , reuters reports . the voting group behind the oscars is largely old , white , and male and was lambasted this year with the hashtag # oscarssowhite after two years in a row of all-white acting nominees . in response , the academy is attempting to—as the av club puts it— " add seemingly goddamn everyone it had , for one reason or another , forgotten to invite into its membership. ” the actors , directors , and others invited wednesday include idris elba , eva mendes , oscar isaac , john boyega , ice cube , greta gerqig , michael b. jordan , vivica a . fox , the wachowskis , james wan , luis guzmán , kate beckinsale , park chan-wook , james hong , michelle rodriguez , and not one , not two , but three wayans brothers . of the new invitees , 46 % are women and 41 % are people of color . if all 683 accept their invite , women would account for 27 % of the more than 7,000 academy members ( up from 25 % ) and minorities would total 11 % ( up from 8 % ) . “ i 'm especially happy to be part of such a diverse group . i actually want to hang out and watch movies with most of the people on this list , " arab-german director lexi alexander tells the los angeles times . “ to be honest , i cried a few tears when i started to get congratulation tweets in arabic. ” other invitees took to twitter to share similar sentiments . “ excited to use my vote to nominate talent that reflects the real world we live in—diversity , " tweets brie larson , who won best actress at this year 's oscars .
