photographers were out in force last night to capture a rare blue moon . no , blue moons are n't actually blue ( although there have been moons that were blue , most recently in 1950 ) ; rather , the term refers to the second full moon in a month , usa today reports . but wait , you exclaim ! last night was august 's first full moon , so something must be amiss , right ? international science times clears things up : the first ( and , in its telling , " most valid " ) definition of a blue moon is the third of four full moons that occur in a single season . a season would typically have only three , and this extra moon comes about every two to three years . the next will be in 2015 .
