imf chief christine lagarde probably wants this one back : she infuriated greeks last week by asserting that a big part of the nation 's financial crisis is " all these people in greece who are trying to escape tax . " it 's time for this nation of tax-dodgers to pay up , she declared . after getting bombarded by critics on facebook , lagarde walked back the criticism a bit , notes the new york times . but today , the guardian follows up with more fodder for her critics : lagarde has to pay no taxes at all on her own $ 468,000 salary . " i suppose we can have a discussion about why international organization employees shouldn â€™ t pay taxes , " writes david dayen at firedog lake . " but the bigger issue is that lagarde surely knew at the time of making comments about evil tax evaders that she paid no tax on her salary . this reeks of the attitude of one system for the little people , and one for the elites , which characterizes elite discourse in this day and age .
