jefferson parish sheriff 's office sgt . troy smith is dead . the question is whether it was by his own hand or his wife 's . a judge on tuesday determined there was sufficient probable cause to hold smith 's wife , shantel parria wagner , in connection with his june 24 death . the timeline in the case begins one week prior , on father 's day , when wagner called 911 saying her husband had shot himself in the head . wagner is at times crying and near-hysterical in audio of the call posted by fox 8 . the times-picayune reports smith was hospitalized until his death the following week . wagner 's lawyer says smith , 44 , suffered from depression and ptsd , was dealing with financial strain , and texted a suicide threat the day before he was shot . but investigators say the evidence suggests the fatal gunshot wound smith suffered was n't self-inflicted . the autopsy report has n't been finished , however , so the pathologist who handled the autopsy would n't deem it a homicide or suicide on the stand , though the advocate reports she did say smith exhibited no gunpowder burns or abrasions . the head of the sheriff 's office crime lab testified the " totality of evidence , " as the times-picayune puts it , is n't in line with a suicide—though he also acknowledged wagner 's dna was not present on the gun found at the scene . but the judge said inconsistencies in wagner 's story—wdsu reports prosecutors say she altered her story 16 times—and a witness who alleges wagner copped to the murder amounted to probable cause . her bond has been set at $ 300,000 .
