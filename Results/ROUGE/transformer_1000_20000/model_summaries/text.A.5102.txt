there is a long and melodious history of hiding secret messages in song—so-called musical steganography—that dates back at least 500 years . but now a cybersecurity expert from poland has revealed a new way to send messages that are otherwise undetectable through song : tiny adjustments in tempo . to test this , krzysztof szczypiorski turned to club music for its trance-like repetition and happily packed his bags for ibiza off the coast of spain , arguably the dance-club capital of the world , reports vice . ( hey , somebody 's got ta do it . ) szczypiorski reports in the open journal arxiv ( it has not yet been peer reviewed ) that in experiments djing for dancers , he was able to adjust a song 's tempo up or down by as much as 2 % without anyone noticing any change . by having a faster tempo represent a dash and a slower one a dot , he used apple 's logic pro x digital audio workstation to manipulate the speeds of songs like " rhythm is a dancer " by snap ( normally 130 beats per minute ) and randomly encode the message " steganography is a dancer " in morse code , reports mit technology review . so long as the change in tempo was subtle enough , nobody was the wiser . ( listen here . ) his conclusion : it would be pretty simple to develop software that automatically encodes or decodes messages sent this way . an algorithm could be used to decode the message , though it 's possible that some very careful listeners could do so on their own . ( music might also help your beer taste better . )
