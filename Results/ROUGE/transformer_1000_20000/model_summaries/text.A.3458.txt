belgium 's former king has to undergo a paternity test . per the telegraph , a mandate just handed down by a brussels appeals court will force king albert ii , who gave up his crown in 2013 so his son philippe could sit on the throne , to have his saliva tested to see if he 's the father of 50-year-old multimedia artist delphine boel . the ex-monarch has denied for more than 10 years that he 's boel 's dad , but a 1999 biography on albert 's wife , queen paola , tells a different story . that tome alleges albert had a long-time affair with aristocrat sybille de selys longchamps , a relationship that allegedly resulted in the birth of boel in the late '60s ; the affair reportedly ended in 1976 , when albert chose to stay with paola so he would n't have to abdicate . albert has admitted his marriage to paola , which produced three children of their own ( all older than boel ) , was n't always smooth , per reuters . the man boel grew up believing was her father , jacques boel , has already been determined via dna testing to not be her biological father . the court order , which overturned an earlier ruling and ca n't be appealed , says albert has three months to comply with the testing . if he refuses , he 'll be legally deemed boel 's father . ( salvador dali , you are not the father of this spanish woman . )
