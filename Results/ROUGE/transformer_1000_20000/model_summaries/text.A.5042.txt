scientists in canada say they 've found a way to trick the heart , making it behave as if it were the beneficiary of exercise even if no exercise was able to be done . according to a study in cell research , the ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 ( ct1 ) can fuel healthy heart growth , repair heart damage , and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure , as a result of heart attack , and right heart failure , as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs , reports medical news today . it 's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure do n't work on right heart failure , which usually requires a heart transplant , per a release . exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart 's ability to pump blood , but " people with heart failure usually ca n't exercise , " researcher lynn megeney tells the ottawa citizen . the heart usually responds by expanding , irreversibly , in an unhealthy way . but that 's why ct1 is " very exciting , " megeney says . it " causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart , " increasing blood flow just like with exercise . and just like with exercise , the heart returns to its original size afterward . megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants , but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and , assuming they go well , a decade before treatment is available to the public .
