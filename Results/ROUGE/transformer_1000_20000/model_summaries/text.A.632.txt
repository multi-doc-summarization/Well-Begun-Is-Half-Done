madison , wis. , saw peaceful protests yesterday in the wake of the shooting death of 19-year-old tony robinson by a police officer , with both robinson 's family and police urging non-violent demonstrations and the police chief vowing to " defend , facilitate , foster those first amendment rights of assembly and freedom of speech . " robinson " was unarmed , " says chief mike koval . " that 's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators , for the public to accept . " the police response marks what the ap calls a " stark contrast " to ferguson . " our community has many questions , questions that i share . there will be answers , " said madison 's mayor . " when the answers come , we will be open and transparent in communicating them . " a 2014 state law mandates such cases be investigated by an outside agency , notes the ap . officer matt kenny , a 12-year veteran who koval said was injured in the struggle that ended in robinson 's death , has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation . he had been involved in a 2007 shooting death of a suspect , reports nbc ; that case was later ruled to be " suicide by cop " and he was exonerated . as for robinson 's criminal history , " i 'm not here to do a character workup on someone who lost his life less than 24 hours ago , " said koval . the ap , however , checked state records and found that robinson pleaded guilty in october to felony armed robbery in connection with a home invasion ; he was sentenced to three years ' probation . a neighbor says she asked him about the robbery , which she deemed out of character . " he felt he was under a lot of pressure from the others to do what he did , " she says . " he told me he would never do anything like that again . "
