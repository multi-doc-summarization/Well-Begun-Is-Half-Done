the amount of perfectly good food that americans throw away every year is enough to feed dozens of smaller countries , and the federal government says it 's time to cut the waste dramatically . we throw away around a third of our food , and the usda and epa have partnered with private sector groups to announce the first-ever target for reducing food waste , which amounts to around 133 billion pounds a year in the us , npr reports . the agencies want to cut waste by 50 % by 2030 , largely by scaling up existing initiatives to educate consumers on avoiding waste and to divert more food to hungry americans . the us " enjoys the most productive and abundant food supply on earth , but too much of this food goes to waste , " agriculture secretary tom vilsack says in a press release . " an average family of four leaves more than two million calories , worth nearly $ 1,500 , uneaten each year . " epa administrator gina mccarthy adds : " let 's feed people , not landfills , " warning that the staggering amounts of food that end up in landfills are a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions . the usda says part of the plan will involve teaching consumers that food is often still good to eat after the " sell by " date and the " use by " date on packaging , reports usa today . ( advocates want a national standard for the " haphazard " and " almost completely arbitrary " system of expiration dates . )
