bernie sanders was busily going after hillary clinton 's blood saturday night , donald trump was waxing poetic about the stability we used to enjoy under some of its bloodiest dictators . asked sunday by cnn 's jake tapper if the world would be a more stable place if moammar gadhafi and saddam hussein were still in power , trump responded , " 100 % . " his full quote : " i mean , look at libya . look at iraq . iraq used to be no terrorists . ( hussein ) would kill the terrorists immediately , which is like now it 's the harvard of terrorism . if you look at iraq from years ago , i 'm not saying he was a nice guy , he was a horrible guy , but it was a lot better than it is right now . right now , iraq is a training ground for terrorists . right now libya , nobody even knows libya , frankly there is no iraq and there is no libya . it 's all broken up . they have no control . nobody knows what 's going on . " trump turned his thoughts to the benghazi hearing , adds the hill , saying , " it was very partisan , and it looked quite partisan . the level of hatred between republicans and democrats was unbelievable . you ’ ve never seen anything like this . " his solution : donald trump . " i ’ m going to unify , " he said . " one of the big knocks on me was that over the years i ’ ve gotten along with democrats and i ’ ve gotten along with republicans , and i said that ’ s a good thing . as a businessman , i had an obligation to do that , to myself , to my family , to my company , to my employees . i get along with everybody . i will be a great unifier for our country .
