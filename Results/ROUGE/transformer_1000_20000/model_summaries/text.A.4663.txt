" but their response—alleging ‘ strategic bulk purchases ’ —is a blatant falsehood . " tyler challenged the newspaper to present its evidence for the accusation . in a piece at the washington post headlined " ted cruz hits the jackpot : a book war with the new york times , " philip bump predicts an ironic conclusion to the tale : the book will eventually show up on the times ' list because all this attention will do wonders for authentic , no-doubt-about-it sales . " in which case cruz gets the conservative cred of being blackballed by the times and the pr bonus of being a times bestseller . win-win . "
