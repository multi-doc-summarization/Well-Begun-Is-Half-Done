a danish radio dj chose a controversial way of drawing attention to what he sees as the flawed debate over animal welfare : he hit a 9-week-old rabbit named allan three times with an iron bicycle pump while on the air monday , then wrung its neck . later , asger juhl of radio24syv ate it for dinner . angry listeners have since called for a boycott of the station , and much worse for juhl himself , reports the bbc . " i did it to show the hypocrisy in the debate , " he says . " many people are outraged by what i did , at the same time many of these people will eat meat . and when they eat meat , an animal will die . " juhl says he consulted with aalborg zoo on a humane way to kill rabbits and was told it used an " iron stick . " the zookeeper " hits several baby rabbits every week [ to feed ] the snakes , " juhl explains , per the local . his employer is unapologetic . the new york times quotes station editor-in-chief jorgen ramskov as saying the rabbit " was taken good care of , it had a nice life , and it was killed in a decent way . " animals endure " horrific suffering on their way to our dinner tables â€¦ without it invoking any strong reactions or calls for boycott , " a station rep tells sky news . perhaps fueling the outcry on social media , per the times : the station posted two videos on its facebook page : a 20-second clip showing juhl cradling and petting a very-alive allan , and a 10-second clip showing what the station described as pieces of allan , cooking in a pan . those two parts are important , argued the station in a facebook post yesterday . " we knew that we would be accused of provocation . but it is not an empty provocation ; the presenters of the program ate the animal after killing it . " ( it 's not the first controversial animal killing in denmark . )
