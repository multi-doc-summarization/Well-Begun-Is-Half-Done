google handed out more than $ 2 million to more than 300 people in 2015 who spotted bugs and security issues , but one award in particular stands out , reports beta news . the odd sum of $ 6,006.13 went to sanmay ved , a former google employee and current mba candidate at babson college in massachusetts . why the weird amount ? it kind of spells " google " numerically . " squint a little and you ’ ll see it ! " says google 's online security blog in a post on the 2015 awards . it seems ved was messing around with the google domains interface late one night in september ( because do n't we all ? ) when to his surprise the domain name google.com appeared as available for purchase . for $ 12 . so he found himself buying—with a credit card and all—one of the world 's most famous domains . his moment of glory was quite literally just that—within a minute google canceled the transaction , which google can do because it owns the registration service itself . ved says he does n't know exactly what caused the glitch on google 's end , but he details the geekily sordid affair on his linkedin account . cnet speculates that google missed a renewal deadline , and ved was able to capitalize . a nice footnote : when ved elected to donate his award to charity—it went to this education foundation—google doubled it . microsoft ran into a similar problem back in 2003 but did not immediately cancel the sale of hotmail.co.uk . fortunately for microsoft , the buyer returned it that same day , the register reported at the time . ( speaking of domains , google has bought the entire alphabet . )
