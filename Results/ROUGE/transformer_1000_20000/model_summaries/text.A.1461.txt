the co-founder of annotation service rap genius has been turfed out after making stunningly tasteless remarks on the manifesto of santa barbara shooter elliot rodger . mahbod moghadam called the 141-page document " beautifully written " and speculated that the shooter 's sister is " smokin hot . " rap genius ceo tom lehman said moghadam had resigned over the annotations , which " didn ’ t attempt to enhance anyone ’ s understanding of the text , but went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny . " sources , however , tell re/code that the co-founder was asked to leave by lehman and also faced pressure from investors . before the resignation , moghadam apologized , saying : " i was fascinated by the fact that a text was associated with such a heartbreaking crime , especially since elliot is talking about my neighborhood growing up . " his departure appears to be a sign that the company , which has expanded from rap lyrics into crowdsourced explanations of things like legal documents and classic literature , wants to distance itself from " swaggish " behavior , reports valleywag , which notes that moghadam has blamed previous outbursts on a brain tumor .
