there 's a reason we do n't typically call earth 's oldest person the oldest woman in the worldâ€”the oldest person is pretty much always a woman . in fact , just two of the world 's 53 living supercentenarians ( people 110 and older ) are men , reports ifl science . but why is the longevity gap so stark , and how long has it been so ? an international team of researchers is investigating the lifespans of men and women born between 1800 and 1935 in 13 developed nations in search of answers , reports physorg , and they 've found that women 's superior longevity only emerged recently . before 1840 , death rates were very similar between men and women . but since those rates began to plummet in 1880 thanks in large part to improved diets , vaccinations , and better health care , female death rates have dropped 70 % faster than male ones , and heart disease seems to be holding men back the most , the researchers report in proceedings of the national academy of sciences . men may be more biologically susceptible to cardiovascular health problems , and their different weight distribution could play a role here , reports live science . the researchers plan to further explore the differences between male and female biology , genetics , and lifestyles to look for answers .
