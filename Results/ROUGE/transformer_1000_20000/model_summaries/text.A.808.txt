a massive 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck in the caribbean sea tuesday night—but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage after what was one of the strongest earthquakes on record in the region . the us geological survey says the quake hit 25 miles off the coast of honduras ' unpopulated great swan island at a relatively shallow depth of 6.2 miles , weather.com reports . tsunami warnings were issued for the caribbean coasts of mexico and central america as well as islands including puerto rico and cuba , but they were called off after about an hour , the ap reports . the quake—stronger than the 7.0 quake that devastated haiti in 2010—could be felt more than 300 miles away in tegucigalpa , the honduran capital , but officials have n't reported more damage than cracks to homes in northern provinces . " it felt like a bulldozer was driving past , " rodrigo anaya rodriguez tells the guardian from his home in the mexican state of quintana roo . " it did n't last long but was very violent . " cbc meteorologist johanna wagstaffe says the quake hit an " amazingly good spot " in the sea between honduras and cuba . given its size , she says , there would have been a lot more damage if it had been closer to either country .
