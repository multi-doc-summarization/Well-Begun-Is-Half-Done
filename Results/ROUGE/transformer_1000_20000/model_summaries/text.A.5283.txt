like a game of risk , russia and nato have not only been suspiciously eying each other in recent months , but also conducting military exercises in border areas that the washington post says are making europe " a region of high military drama . " now a uk-based think tank is warning that these war games could lead to real conflict if they do n't start communicating and scaling down their activities , the guardian reports . the european leadership network says that although reps from both sides may insist these training exercises—including a flurry of activity in march for russia and in june for nato , per the post—are against hypothetical opponents , it 's clear there are definite foes in mind , and that alleviative measures need to take place asap to stave off a possible confrontation . " russia is preparing for a conflict with nato , and nato is preparing for a possible confrontation with russia , " the report asserts , adding that even though this does n't make a real conflict unavoidable , it helps perpetuate tension in the region—especially thick since the russia-ukraine conflict . the organization 's recommendation : tamp down the size and scale of said exercises , start hammering out a new treaty on limiting the types of weapons used along the borders , and publicly announce beforehand when exercises are being held ( russia is pointed out as a prime offender in this regard ) . but a nato rep told bloomberg that the eln report " misleadingly puts nato and russian exercises on par " and that " the scale and scope of russia 's exercises are far beyond anything the alliance is doing . russia is deliberately avoiding military transparency and predictability . " ( nato 's got its hands full with isis , too . )
