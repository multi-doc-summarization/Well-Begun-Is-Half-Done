" this is highly unusual , " says a rep for maryland natural resources police , and that might be putting it lightly . the maryland nrp has confirmed that a 51-year-old who was hunting geese with a larger group was rendered unconscious when a dead goose fell from the sky and hit him . robert meilhammer regained consciousness as emergency officials arrived on the scene just before 5pm thursday , but demarva now reports the crapo , maryland , man struggled to answer questions beyond his name and so was flown to a baltimore hospital . the baltimore sun reports it 's unclear which hunter shot the goose , which the washington post reports typically weighs about 12 pounds and has a wing span of up to six feet . the post reports meilhammer 's head injury was initially described as " severe , " and that two of his teeth were knocked out by the hit . the maryland nrp tweeted friday morning that he was in stable condition and awaiting further tests . ( as this hunter tracked a lion , he was shot dead . )
