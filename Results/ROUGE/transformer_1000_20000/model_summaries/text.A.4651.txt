cody ha may have been 600 miles from his friend in texas , but the 23-year-old kansas man sounded as though he were in the same room via the microphones and headphones the pair used to communicate while playing video games online with others saturday . then , around 10pm , ashley martinez of houston heard at least two loud popping noises that hurt his ears , reports the wichita eagle . ha did n't speak again , and when players called his phone , they heard only the unanswered ring through his microphone , martinez says . an hour later , they heard something else : ha 's sister arriving at the wichita home to find her brother and 62-year-old mother , huong pham , covered in blood , dead of gunshot wounds , per kake . " she was panicking , " martinez recalls . " she said she did n't feel safe . " another friend tells the eagle that people often visited the family 's home to buy what ha described as prescription drugs . he suggests pham sold the drugs and gave ha a cut of the proceeds . court records show that pham had prior conflicts with others : in 2014 , a woman accused pham of sending two men " looking for me and my husband " over a money dispute . pham later said the woman " hired somebody to cause me harm for $ 2,000 â€¦ after i talked about the money owed my family . " pham said someone broke windows of a family business and slashed the tires of her son 's car around the same time . police , who 've named no suspects , are investigating whether the saturday shooting death of a pizza hut delivery driver three blocks from ha and pham 's home is related , per the washington post .
