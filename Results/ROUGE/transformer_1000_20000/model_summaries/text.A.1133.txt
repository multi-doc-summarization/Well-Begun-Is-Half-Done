chris dodd is preparing to introduce a sweeping bank reform bill on monday in the senate without any republican support . the move comes after months of negotiations with the gop 's bob corker , who said the two were on the " 5-yard-line " before dodd got pressure from the white house to push a bill out of committee before a health care vote . says dodd : " there is n't a lot of time left to complete bank reform this year . the real problem i 'm facing is that clock . " corker said " there 's no question that white house politics and health care have kept us from getting to the goal line , " reports marketwatch . assuming dodd and corker do n't patch up remaining differences quickly about the legislation , which is to include tougher consumer protections , democrats could face a filibuster on the senate floor , reports the wall street journal .
