the death of otto warmbier is a mystery and it will probably stay that way unless somebody from north korea comes forward with information , hamilton county coroner lakshmi sammarco says . at a press conference in cincinnati wednesday , the coroner said the american student 's death was caused by complications from brain-damaging oxygen deprivation around six months into his imprisonment in north korea , but the cause of the initial " insult " could not be determined , reports reuters . " we do n't know what happened to him , and that 's the bottom line , " she said . warmbier 's family declined an autopsy , but sammarco said a ct scan served as a " virtual autopsy . " sammarco , whose report stated there were no signs of torture on warmbier 's body , said he had apparently been well cared for during the year or more he was bedridden , the ap reports . sammarco said she decided to speak to the press after warmbier 's parents told national media he had been tortured and " destroyed , " the cincinnati enquirer reports . she said a forensic dentist found no damage to the 22-year-old 's teeth , which father fred warmbier said looked like they had been rearranged with pliers . " they 're grieving parents . i ca n't really make comments on their perceptions , " she said . " but we here in his office , we depend on science for our conclusions . if we do n't have the science , we don â€™ t conjecture . "
