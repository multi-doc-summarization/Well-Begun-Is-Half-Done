the chromodoris reticulata has a peculiar way of mating : after the deed is done , the sea slug sheds its penis ... and then grows a new one within 24 hours and does the whole thing again . " i have n't seen anything like this before , " says one expert . a team of japanese researchers discovered the surprising behavior in the species , which lives in the pacific ocean , the bbc reports . chromodoris reticulata is the first creature known to have what they 're calling a " disposable penis . " other creatures discard their sex organ post-copulation , but they do n't re-grow it . the researchers called the slug 's behavior " extremely peculiar . " a large part of the slug 's penis is actually an internal one that 's coiled inside its body ; this is what regenerates the detached portion after sex . the studied slugs were seen to mate three times in a row , 24 hours apart each time ; it 's not clear if the penis could regenerate once again , perhaps months later . the evolutionary purpose ? scientists are n't quite sure , but they say the purpose of the first sex act may be to remove any sperm left by a previous partner . the disposable penis is far from the slugs ' only sexual quirk : the penises are equipped with spines that could help with the removal of prior sperm , afp reports . the creatures are also " simultaneous hermaphrodites , " which means they have male and female sexual organs that can be used simultaneously .
