ufo enthusiasts last week got a gander of an alien allegedly recovered from roswell—oversized head and all—but experts say the evidence likely originated on planet earth , tech times reports . attendees at a ufo conference in mexico city paid $ 350 for the chance to see an old kodachrome color slide said to capture an alien that crashed in new mexico in 1947 ( ufo lovers call it the " roswell incident " ) . a journalist apparently dated the film stock to the 1940s , discovery reports , saying it was recovered in arizona from an oil geologist 's photo collection . the slide shows a small figure with a big head in a display case ; discovery argues that the skeleton belonged to a child ( with typically oversized head ) or the body of a mummified child with a deformed head . such bodies have been turning up for years in the americas and identified as extraterrestrials , discovery reported last year . what 's more , no eyewitness at roswell in 1947 described aliens or even a flying saucer ; the first one there talked about something " made up of rubber strips , tinfoil , a rather tough paper and sticks " ( the us air force put it down to air balloons and radar detectors that crashed there ) . yet ufo proponents at the mexico city event stood firm : " analysis of the body ... suggested this is not a mummy and not a human , not a mammal and not a model , " says enthusiast richard dolan , reuters reports . a british defense official was less enthused , telling the mirror that " it could be a model , or it could simply be a fake image , dressed up to look like a forties slide .
