the bodies of those who succumb to the himalayan mountains likely stay on the slopes forever—it 's often too difficult , dangerous , and costly to retrieve them . that fact did n't stop steve aisthorpe of scotland from his recent mission on the nepal-tibet border : to get " closure " on the fate of kristinn runarsson and thorsteinn gudjonsson , friends and fellow climbers who vanished during a 1988 expedition with him . aisthorpe , who the guardian notes found out just a few weeks ago his friends ' bodies had been seen at the end of a glacier on pumori mountain , recalls on the church of scotland 's website how his group started as four climbers in october of that year , though one of the men fell ill early on and dropped out . aisthorpe , then 26 , came down with the flu , and so he climbed back down on oct. 16 , 1988 , to seek medical attention . when aisthorpe realized he was in no condition to attempt the climb , he sent a message back to runarsson and gudjonsson , both 27 and from iceland : " feel free " to go for the summit without him . the two men were never seen alive again after oct. 18 . when aisthorpe finally felt well enough to head back to the last camp where he 'd left his friends , " my calls echoed from the rocks and ice before fading . … the silence was palpable . " fast-forward 30 years , when an american climber spotted their bodies just last month ; a group of local climbers brought the remains down . among those at the cremation ceremony in kathmandu for the men was runarsson ’ s 30-year-old son ; runarsson ’ s fiancee had been pregnant when the father of her child was lost to pumori . more on their tale here . ( two highly experienced climbers died on el capitan over the summer . )
