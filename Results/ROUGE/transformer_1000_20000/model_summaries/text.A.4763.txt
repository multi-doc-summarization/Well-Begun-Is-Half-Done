tomorrow , wisconsinites will decide whether to keep gov . scott walker or boot him in favor of milwaukee mayor tom barrett , in what chris cillizza of the washington post is calling " the second most important and influential race of 2012 aside from the presidential , " with " absolutely massive " stakes . here 's what you need to know as the clock ticks down : two polls released yesterday show the race virtually tied—walker leads in each , but by thin margins . he 's up 50-47 in one , 53-47 in the other , but both are within the margin of error , reuters reports . it 's all about turnout now : " if democrats turn out in the numbers they did in 2008 , tom barrett will win a surprise victory . if they do n't , walker will survive , " the head of public policy polling says . the agency managing the election is predicting turnout somewhere between 60 % and 65 % —above 2010 's 49.7 % , but below 2008 's 69.2 % " if there 's any state that epitomizes what the permanent campaign feels like , it 's this one , " observes david catanese of politico . this will be the seventh time wisconsin has gone to the polls in the last 14 months , thanks to various recalls . all those campaigns are expensive : through may 21 , $ 110 million had been spent on political ads . president obama will be closely watching the results , because he 's counting on wisconsin in november , the new york times points out . " a republican victory here could set off a wave of adjustments in the lineup of swing states . " if scott walker wins , cillizza expects to hear presidential rumblings surrounding him . a lot is on the line for barrett , too ; this would be his third gubernatorial defeat , likely ending his statewide ambitions . organized labor has a lot to lose , too . a walker win would be both an affirmation of his anti-union policies , and a signal that unions have lost their political juice ; they opposed barrett in the primary , and lost there , too .
