republicans including paul ryan and marco rubio were quick to speak out against president trump 's comments tuesday that " both sides " were to blame for the violence in charlottesville , va. , over the weekend . but that was n't at all what the white house had planned . a memo of talking points sent to republicans and other allies tuesday called on them to declare trump was " entirely correct , " report cbs news and fox news , which both obtained a copy . " both sides of the violence in charlottesville acted inappropriately , and bear some responsibility , " the memo continued , noting trump 's comments reaffirmed that " we are equal in the eyes of our creator , equal under the law , and equal under our constitution . " the memo stressed that trump " condemned—with no ambiguity—the hate groups fueled by bigotry and racism " and is " taking swift action to hold violent hate groups accountable , " per business insider . after referring to trump as " a voice for unity and calm , " it called on leaders and the media to " join the president in trying to unite and heal our country rather than incite more division . " censure followed , however , from almost all sides . from republicans , it was " swifter and more widespread than perhaps at any point in his presidency , " reports politico . a standout tweet from rubio : " mr. president , you ca n't allow # whitesupremacists to share only part of blame . they support idea which cost nation & world so much pain .
