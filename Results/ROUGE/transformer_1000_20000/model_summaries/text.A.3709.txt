the us will formally recognize syria 's opposition as the country 's legitimate representative , barack obama announced today in an interview with barbara walters on abc . " it 's a big step , " obama said . " we 've made a decision that the syrian opposition coalition is now inclusive enough , is reflective and representative enough of the syrian population " to be recognized . the move allows the us to work more closely with the rebels , and opens up the possibility of sending them weaponsâ€”though one official said that was n't in the cards yet . " not everybody who is participating on the ground in fighting assad are people that we are comfortable with , " obama added . " there are some who i think have adopted an extremist agenda . " the announcement comes just ahead of a meeting of syrian opposition leaders and their supporters in morocco , the new york times observes . it also notes that the move does n't fully confer the legal authority of a state ; the opposition ca n't , for example , access syrian government money or take over the regime 's washington embassy .
