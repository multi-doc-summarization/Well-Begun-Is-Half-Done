president trump launched his push for tax reform wednesday in indianapolis , promising a " once-in-a-generation opportunity " and " revolutionary change . " " under our framework , we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that american companies and american workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again , " usa today quotes trump as saying . the new york times reports the proposed framework reduces the corporate tax rate to 20 % , doubles deductions for married and single filers to $ 24,000 and $ 12,000 respectively , and reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to three . the top bracket would see a reduced tax rate ; the lowest bracket would see an increased tax rate . overall , trump claims the plan represents the biggest tax cut in history : " there 's never been tax cuts like we 're talking about . " trump is promising the middle class will be " the biggest winners " of his tax plan , which will cause " jobs to start pouring into our country . " but the framework presented lacks details to show whether that would or would not be the case . ( cnn reports trump also claims the plan is " not good for me , " but that 's impossible to prove without his tax returns . ) the framework does , however , include details that will specifically benefit rich americans , for example by getting rid of inheritance taxes paid by the country 's wealthiest families . without further specifics , the head of the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget calls trump 's tax plan " nothing more than a fiscal fantasy . " trump says he wants to work with democrats to fill in those details , but republican leaders say they 'll likely use a special rule to pass tax reform without democratic support .
