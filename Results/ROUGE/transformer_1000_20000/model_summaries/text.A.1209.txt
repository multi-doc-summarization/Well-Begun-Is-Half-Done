an escaped lion , a taunting crowd , and an ill-prepared first-response team came together in kenya to cause what some are saying was the unnecessary , senseless death of the lion , the country 's star reports . mohawk , a 13-year-old lion who was one of nairobi national park 's most well-known creatures due to his trademark mane and rep as somewhat of a " ladies ' lion , " had escaped from an unfenced section of the park and ended up in the town of isinya , where he was promptly surrounded by a jeering group of men , the washington post reports . mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—kenya wildlife service officials tell the ap about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man , who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back . the wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene , but those rangers had only rifles , not tranquilizers . after mohawk pounced on the bystander , the rangers felt they could n't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the star says was nine bullets , leaving the animal " roaring and writhing in pain " as he died . " if the rangers had the right equipment , this lion would not have died , " a local resident tells the paper . " you ca n't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it . we blame them for this heinous act . " the shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media , including a # justiceformohawk hashtag , but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans . " this action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety , " the kenya wildlife service says , per cnn . a bunch of lions have busted out of the park lately , driven by what conservationists say is the noise from development projects , including a highway being built through the park . ( same ending , different means for cecil the lion . )
