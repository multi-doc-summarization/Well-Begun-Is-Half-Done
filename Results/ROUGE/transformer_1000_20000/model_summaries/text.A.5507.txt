a strange drama unfolded today at dutch national broadcaster nos , where a young man clad in a suit and wielding what appeared to be a pistol demanded air time before being arrested , reports the bbc . police later said the pistol was fake , reports abc news . authorities have identified the culprit only as a 19-year-old from the town of pijnacker near the hague . his apparent plan was to address the nation during the evening news broadcast , but reuters credits a " quick-thinking security guard " with leading him into an empty studio instead . video shows him pacing and complaining that " this is taking too long " before several officers enter the studio and arrest him without a struggle . while he was pacing , the man said , " the things that are going to be said ( pause ) those are very large world affairs . we were hired by the security service . " he also had a letter threatening the detonation of radioactive bombs if he did n't get on the air . a nos reporter said the man told him that he was from a " hackers ' collective , " without elaboration , reports ap . though he did n't get on the air , the man did manage to disrupt the national news . staffers fled the studio , and viewers instead saw a logo on their screens reading , " please be patient . " nos was off the air about an hour .
