alaska has experienced some unusual natural phenomena lately—including a burping volcano and a desperate need for snow—and it just took another turn into some more weather-related weirdness . per the alaska dispatch news , the mercury at an airport in southeast alaska registered at 71 degrees on thursday , which university of alaska fairbanks climate scientist brian brettschneider says set a record high for temps in march , beating out a peak of 69 degrees set in march 1915 . " the fact that it 's march—it 's pretty amazing , " a national weather service meteorologist in juneau says . " it 's a big deal . " what scientists say has brought on this thermometer-busting breach in klawock , which ktva notes is northwest of ketchikan on prince of wales island , is a high-pressure ridge that brettschneider tells the dispatch news is " basically [ like we ] had a june or july air mass move in in march . if we had june or july sun , it would have been 80 degrees , but we did n't . " other towns have similarly recorded record highs , and the warm weather is , as of now , anticipated to continue through may . ( alaska also just had the weirdest murder plot in a while . )
