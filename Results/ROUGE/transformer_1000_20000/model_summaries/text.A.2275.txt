a sea change in cvs policy : by october 1 , america 's biggest pharmacy chain will no longer sell any tobacco products , parent company cvs caremark announced today in what ceo larry merlo calls the " right thing for us to do . " " we ’ ve got 26,000 pharmacists and nurse practitioners who are helping millions of patients each and every day , " explains merlo . " they manage conditions like high blood pressure , high cholesterol , and diabetes—all conditions that are worsened by smoking . we ’ ve come to the decision that cigarettes have no place in an environment where healthcare is being delivered . " cvs is the first retailer ever to drop tobacco , forbes reports—a move that will cost the company $ 2 billion in annual sales . cvs , as well as other pharmacies , is looking to get more involved with healthcare ; it already offers flu shots and minute clinics , where nurse practitioners can prescribe medications . selling cigarettes just does n't fit with that plan for growth , merlo says . and cvs ' chief medical officer thinks that dropping tobacco will give cvs an advantage over rival pharmacies when making deals with healthcare providers . ex-smoker president obama wasted no time in supporting the move , the weekly standard reports : he " applauds " the news and calls it " a powerful example .
