" they went through a pure hell , no doubt , " says an arkansas sheriff 's detective about the ordeal two small children somehow managed to surviveâ€”all thanks to the eldest of them , a 3-year-old named kylen . the boy was found wandering alone on a state highway near camden , arkansas , on monday , cnn reports . he was scraped up and " extremely traumatized , " says ouachita county sheriff 's detective lt. nathan greeley , per cnn . it was upon trying to reconnect the child with family that they learned his mother , lisa holliman , had last been seen going to the grocery store on thursday ; she also had a 1-year-old son . a search led to holliman 's overturned car in a ravine , apparently the result of a single-car crash and not visible from the road . the infant was found strapped in his car seat alive ; holliman , 25 , had been ejected and was dead . " we 're still trying to determine the timeline , but the mother was last seen thursday , " greeley said . " this is one of the most remarkable things i 've ever experienced in my 11 years at this department . " holliman 's father , james , tells kark that kylen was able to unstrap himself and exit the car through the sunroof . " when he climbed out of that car , seeing his mother dead like that like she was , he tried to wake his mom up , " he says . the boys survived without food and water ; the temperatures were high and thunderstorms came through the area . " it 's nothing short of a miracle , " says greeley . but still , a tragedy : holliman 's family learned she was four weeks pregnant at the time of her death . the crash remains under investigation .
