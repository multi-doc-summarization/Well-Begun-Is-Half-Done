a 33-year-old british man who allegedly hacked into the fbi , nasa , and federal reserve and did millions of dollars worth of damage as a form of protest in 2012 and 2013 wo n't be stepping foot on us soil anytime soon . the high court of london decided against extradition on monday , with the guardian reporting that it agreed with the two arguments his lawyers put forth as part of love 's appeal against extradition : that he could be prosecuted in the uk , and that love , who has asperger 's and depression , could end up killing himself while in us custody . the ap reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in england , where family and friends would be accessible to him . the bbc and wired quote love as saying " the reason i have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country i have never visited , " but that he hoped his case set a " precedent so this will not happen to people in the future . ... i 'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity , whose brains are made up in a slightly different way . " wired notes that love would have faced up to 99 years and a fine of up to $ 9 million were he convicted in us courts . as for prospects of being tried on his own shore , the judges in their ruling " emphasize ... that it would not be oppressive to prosecute mr. love in england for the offences alleged against him .
