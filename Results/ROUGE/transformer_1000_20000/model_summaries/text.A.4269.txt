first fifa , now this ? yep , evidence has emerged of possible widespread match-fixing in the pristine world of professional tennis . according to documents obtained by the bbc and buzzfeed , investigators hired by the association of tennis professionals uncovered signs of corrupt betting syndicates and gamblers buying off well-ranked players—but little was done to fix the problem . " there was a core of about 10 players who we believed were the most common perpetrators that were at the root of the problem , " says mark phillips , an investigator in a landmark 2007 enquiry . " the evidence was really strong . " yet tennis officials shelved their conclusions , saying lawyers advised them that strict new rules could n't be applied to players retroactively . among the accusations : corrupt gamblers have contacted players in their hotels and offered them $ 50,000 or more to fix a match . gambling syndicates in russia and italy then placed " highly suspicious bets on scores of matches—including at wimbledon and the french open , " says buzzfeed . more than 70 players are suspected of taking part , but buzzfeed and the bbc decided not to print names because the suspects ' computer , bank , and phone records were n't available as conclusive proof . suspects include winners of grand slam singles and doubles titles , and eight players slated to play in the australian open starting monday . " there is an element of actually keeping things under wraps , " says an investigator . but nigel willerton , who heads the unit designed to police tennis , denies the accusations : " all credible information received by the [ tennis integrity unit ] is analysed , assessed , and investigated by highly experienced former law-enforcement investigators , " he says .
