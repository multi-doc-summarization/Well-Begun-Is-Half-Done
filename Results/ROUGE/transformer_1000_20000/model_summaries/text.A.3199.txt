one might expect students taking a class called " sports , ethics , and religion " to know better , but dartmouth college says that it 's uncovered widespread cheating in a class with that title , reports bloomberg . " i feel pretty burned by the whole thing , " says class professor randall balmer , who says he found 43 kids were using a clicker to answer questions for absent students . " i ’ ve never faced anything on this scale before . " after he made the bust , and reported it as an honor code violation , another 21 students came forward . the class was aimed at jocks , and many of those accused are student athletes , notes the valley news . laments dartmouth 's ethics institute director , the current generation was " raised with the notion that they are the best , not with the notions of integrity , responsibility , and self-sacrifice . it ’ s a difficult notion for an 18-year-old—self-regulation . " balmer opted to drop students by a letter grade rather than flunk them , in what gawker says is " the right thing to do , not that any of them would know it . "
