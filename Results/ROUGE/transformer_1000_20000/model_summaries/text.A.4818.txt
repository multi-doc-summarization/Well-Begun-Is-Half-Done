let 's just say this wouldn ’ t have happened to the real james bond . pierce brosnan , who played the iconic 007 agent in four flicks , was stopped at vermont ’ s burlington international airport on sunday attempting to carry a 10-inch hunting knife on board a flight , police say . tsa agents found the bone-handled blade stashed in his carry-on luggage and seized it , apparently to brosnan 's chagrin and anger , reports the telegraph . a source says brosnan—traveling with his 14-year-old son , paris—had to remove his belt for a pat-down , then was screened in a private area . he apparently told his son , " i ca n't believe they 're doing this . " tmz reports officials asked brosnan to surrender the knife or put it in his checked luggage ; he chose the latter . the burlington police department says officials then let the actor board a flight . or as the mail puts it , they chose to " live and let fly . "
