a reminder to those who like to buck authority : you should at least heed warnings related to great white sharks . a 42-year-old british expat had parts of both his legs bitten off in an attack in cape town today , after going for a swim though shark warning flags were flying , reports the telegraph . michael cohen was about 150 feet from shore at fish hoek beach when the great white struck ; he was apparently dragged out of the water by friends and airlifted to a hospital . " it repeatedly bit at both of his legs and caused serious wounds on both the right and left side , " said a national sea rescue institute rep. " when medical teams arrived , they found the swimmer with his right leg bit off above the knee and the left leg bit off below the knee . " witnesses say three great whites had been been spotted nearby just 90 minutes before cohen was attacked , and the beach was then closed . msnbc reports that cohen was the only swimmer in the water ; a shark spotter reportedly tried to get him out , but did n't get to him in time . a video of a shark was taken in the area just after the attack .
