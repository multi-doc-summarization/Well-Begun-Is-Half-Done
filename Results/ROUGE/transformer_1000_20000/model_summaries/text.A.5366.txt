they 're not quite working together , but american and cuban authorities are both looking into the theft of at least 70 artworks from a havana museum . in the first such heist reported since the 1959 cuban revolution , paintings worth a total of around $ 1.5 million were apparently cut from their frames while in storage at the cuban capital 's national museum of fine arts , reports cnn . the theft was uncovered after miami art dealer ramon cernuda bought a suspicious painting and alerted both the museum and the fbi late last month ; the museum then reviewed its archives and confirmed the theft . cernuda says art theft in cuba is extremely rare , and it is rarer still for stolen cuban art to be found in the us . " the theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of cuba , " he says . " to just get the art out of the museum is very complicated . " soon after the museum acknowledged the theft , cuba 's minister of culture was fired without explanation , the havana times notes . cernuda says he turned the stolen painting over to the fbi and he believes the agency will hand any recovered artworks back to havana despite poor us-cuban relations . " i am about certain it will go back , " he says . " stolen property is stolen property . "
