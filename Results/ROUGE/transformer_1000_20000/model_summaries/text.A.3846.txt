coty vincent 's car was smashed last week after a hit-and-run accident , so she lugged her twin boys to a rental car company , cnn reports . but the oklahoma mom did n't find only a vehicle at enterprise rent-a-car in tulsa : she also found a young man she says is " one of the most compassionate and caring people i 've ever met , " per her facebook post . she tells today that the car company sent 25-year-old employee john goodlett to her home to pick up her and the 11-month-old babies and bring them to the office . she did n't have a double stroller , so she asked goodlett to carry one of her sons in—and once inside , vincent figured he 'd hand the baby back to her and " let me fend for myself . " instead , he held onto his young charge and started working on her order on the computer . vincent was so touched that she took a photo of him holding the baby and posted it online , where the image quickly went viral ( it 's got more than 25,000 shares on her facebook page ) . there 's a reason goodlett may have felt a special kinship with the little ones : he has a twin sister . " just like any sibling , one moment we got each other 's back , one moment we 're yelling at each other 's throats , " he tells today . " but … it 's a natural love . " vincent , meanwhile , has started a # beajohn hashtag , noting , " this world would be a better place if we all would just be a john . " enterprise is doing its part : after getting wind of goodlett 's interaction with vincent , it bought the mom a double stroller and made a donation to the boys & girls club where goodlett spent time when he was a kid ( he turned down a gift card for himself ) . " i 'm still blown away , " he tells today . " it 's kind of shocking to see the world took it as such a big motion . i hope it helps get the message out that this is the way people are supposed to treat each other every day . " ( this mom has her hands full . )
