you know that person at the top of your contact list , the one most likely to get an unintended call from your butt ? well , if you 're the murderous type , make sure that number is n't 911 . this lesson comes too late for scott simon , who unintentionally dialed 911 while still frothing with rage over a late-night dispute at a waffle house in florida . in the recording , simon is heard saying that he intends to follow the man he was arguing with to his house and shoot him , the miami herald and south florida sun sentinel report . that man , nicholas walker , was indeed shot and killed mere minutes later , while he was pulling his car onto i-95 . simon was arrested tuesday over the may 5 incident , and while police do n't think he actually killed walker , he 's been charged with first-degree murder because they believe he orchestrated the hit . " this is a first for me , " a police spokesman said . " criminals say crazy things all the time , but i 've never seen anyone call a recorded line . "
