a new study on psychology research is essentially bashing all other psychology studies . the research area has gotten a bad rap recently thanks to retracted research papers , so psychologists set out to discover what was going on . when research is valid , others should be able to duplicate the study and come up with the same results . but when more than 250 scientists tried to re-create 100 studies from three respected psychology journals—working closely with original researchers—the results matched in just 39 cases . even among those , 83 % were found to have smaller effects than first reported , reports the verge . the studies covered topics like personality , relationships , learning , and memory , and were the kind trusted by therapists and educators , reports the new york times . a scientist argues the reproducibility issue could apply across other fields , too . " to see it so clearly , on such a large scale—it 's unprecedented , " adds another . " there is little known about the reproducibility of research in general , " says study author brian nosek . " and there has been a growing concern that reproducibility may be lower than expected or desired . " he adds that scientific journals tend to focus on new research , so those hoping to get published do n't waste time testing older studies . nosek does n't consider the results " negative or pessimistic , " but he hopes they 'll lead to self-correction and replication standards . so are these results reproducible ? " even this project itself is not a final word , a last word , a definitive word about reproducibility , " nosek says .
