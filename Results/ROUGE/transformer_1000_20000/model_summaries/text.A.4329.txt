spain 's prince felipe became king felipe vi at midnight as the abdication of his father , king juan carlos , became official . the occasion was fairly low-key , with no foreign heads of state present and no huge state banquet , which the palace says was " in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend , " the ap reports . the 46-year-old king was later proclaimed head of state in a parliamentary ceremony where he promised to be a monarch " who is ready listen and understand , warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times , " the bbc reports . the new king spoke of the need to " look ahead to the spain we are building together as i begin this reign , " reports cnn , which notes that while the monarchy remains popular in spain , the royal family has been accused of corruption and excess during the country 's economic crisisâ€”and juan carlos ' image suffered after he went on a luxurious elephant-hunting trip in the middle of the recession . felipe and his wife , who is now queen letizia , will be driven through the streets of madrid before appearing at the palace but they may find that many spaniards are n't in the mood for cheering : the country 's soccer team , which won the world cup in 2010 , crashed out of the tournament last night with a 2-0 loss to chile .
