sean spicer may have laughed off melissa mccarthy 's portrayal of him on saturday night live , but the white house is in fact " rattled , " reports politico , noting " it was spicer 's portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president 's eyes . " as one president trump donor puts it , " trump does n't like his people to look weak . " some say trump 's silence on the skit on twitter suggests it hit a little too close to home . and though spicer described it as " cute " and " funny , " sources say he actually found it upsetting . but " it does n't really matter what i think , " spicer tells politico . " i would much rather have the focus be on the president 's agenda and the success he 's having . that 's all i 'm saying on it . " steve bannon should perhaps prepare for a similar portrayal . after saturday 's skit , a fan on twitter suggested rosie o'donnell should dress up as trump to get under his skin , reports vanity fair . o'donnell responded that alec baldwin portrays trump and mccarthy does spicer , but she later agreed she 'd like to play bannon , whom mikey day has portrayed as the grim reaper on snl . " if called , i will be ready , " o'donnell tweeted . " i am here to serve . " the show has n't said if o'donnell is likely to appear , but support is growing on twitter , with one user suggesting such a skit would let o'donnell " have the last laugh on trump " after a decade-long feud , per the huffington post .
