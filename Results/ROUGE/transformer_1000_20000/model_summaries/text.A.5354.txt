michigan gov . rick snyder announced a new development wednesday in flint 's water crisis that " just adds to the disaster we are already facing " : specifically , a marked increase in cases of legionnaires ' disease that could be linked to the area 's tainted water , reports the detroit free press . from june 2014 to november 2015 , there were 87 cases in genesee county , 10 of them fatal , per the michigan department of health and human services . in the previous four years , legionnaires ' cases ran from six per year to 13 , cnn notes . and while the mdhhs is n't able to definitively tie the spike to flint 's water , it 's taking the news seriously , and a drinking water expert who 's been studying flint 's water tells the free press there 's a " very strong likelihood " that it played a role . mdhhs officials first observed the rise in legionnaires ' cases in the fall of 2014 , per the free press , and researchers found the bacteria to blame was proliferating in larger buildings , many with older plumbing . " our hypothesis is that something about the flint river and lack of corrosion control , plus big buildings , is creating these problems , " marc edwards , head of an independent virginia team looking into the crisis , tells the free press . speaking wednesday , snyder said he learned of the issue just " a few days ago " and appeared to place some blame on the state 's department of environmental quality , the paper notes . " we 're taking every action within reason , and going beyond reason to address this , " he said . state health officials say it 's ok for residents to shower and bathe , though they still ca n't drink the water . edwards ' team agrees , though he laments how it 's all been handled . " it 's a crisis of conscience in government , " he tells cnn . " there are just so many places where you wish people had done things differently . "
