" i 'm usually not surprised and i was surprised by this , " quest diagnostics expert john golobic tells koat , explaining that some samples yielded the " types of things you 'd find in " fecal matter , signaling a " degree of uncleanliness that would be somewhat disturbing " even if the beard matter probably wo n't make people sick . golobic says that similar results in a public water system would close it for disinfecting . he urges the bearded to keep their beards—and hands—clean , and " to keep your hands away from your face , as much as possible . " nick evershed at the guardian , however , notes that this was n't exactly a scientific study—and even if it was , the diversity of microbes found on human skin means it would n't have to be cause for concern . evershed checked out a few more serious studies on beard bacteria , which were conducted in hospitals , and found that while bearded workers do appear to shed more bacteria than others , even clean-shaven workers shed enough to show the importance of " face coverings for sterile procedures , regardless of your facial hair situation .
