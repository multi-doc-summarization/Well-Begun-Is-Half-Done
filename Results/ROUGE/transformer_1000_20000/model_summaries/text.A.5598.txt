john kerry says he has " high confidence " in us intelligence reports that syria used chemical weapons . vladimir putin has two much different words on the subject : " utter nonsense . " the russian leader used the phrase in urging the us to hold off on any military action until the un has completed its investigation , reports the bbc . the clock is ticking on that : un inspectors left syria today and will brief secretary-general ban ki-moon , but their full report to the security council might take a week or so to complete , reports cnn . kerry and obama have suggested that the us wo n't wait that long , in part because the un inspectors are charged only with determining whether chemical weapons were used , not who employed them . the us says it already is sure that bashar al-assad is the culprit . putin , though , told reporters that it would have been foolish for assad to order the aug. 21 attack because his troops have the upper hand in the war . " in these conditions , to give a trump card to those who are calling for a military intervention is utter nonsense . "
