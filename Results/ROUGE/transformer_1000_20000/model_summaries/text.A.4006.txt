john fisher has no beef with voters calling him on his personal phone , but please do n't call his 91-year-old mother . the michigan democrat , who 's running for a state house seat , is fired up after a gop campaign mailer was sent out this week telling people in the city of portage to call him and " tell him hard-working michiganders are being hurt by obamacare and the health care policies [ democrats ] support . " which would 've been fine , except the phone number on the mailer was the direct line to his mother 's room at a local nursing home , where she 's being given hospice care for congestive heart failure , fisher 's campaign manager tells michigan live . fisher did n't recognize the number when he got his hands on the mailer . " when i dialed it , it came up on my cellphone , and it said , 'mom , ' " he tells wwmt . meanwhile , isabel kramb fielded her son 's calls from her room , giving a stock answer of " i 'm sorry , he 's not here , i 'm his mother , " she tells the station . the michigan gop says it discovered the number online under fisher 's name and apologized " for any distress that was caused " by kramb receiving the phone calls . in a statement cited by michigan live , fisher railed on the campaign promo , noting that " to direct people to call a suffering woman who deserves peace and comfort is beyond the pale . " he also spoke about the mailer outside the nursing homeâ€”with his mother present . wmmt asked him if that was perhaps also in poor taste . " i do n't know how it could be underhanded to try to remind people not to call my mom , " fisher said .
