president trump 's controversies may be wearing thin on both sides of the aisle in the senate . two different outlets on monday have posts with a similar theme : new york times : " senate republicans , increasingly unnerved by president trump ’ s volatility and unpopularity , are starting to show signs of breaking away from him as they try to forge a more traditional republican agenda and protect their political fortunes .

" nbc news and the washington post , meanwhile , have stories explaining how the comey firing is the latest example of a surprise distraction taking away from the gop agenda in the senate , particularly on health care . " anytime you have something else come along when you ’ re debating legislation , while you ’ re trying to iron out something , it can—it takes some of the momentum away , " gop sen. mike lee said on fox news sunday . but , he added , " we ’ re going to get it done one way or another .
