" as such , he was lawfully acting in defense of himself or others . " the finding followed a five-month investigation and protests around california , including a " national day of action for andy lopez " organized by a statewide group opposing police brutality , cbs san francisco reports . andy was walking through rural sonoma county last october , holding a bb gun resembling an ak-47 , when deputies on patrol saw him and told him to drop the weapon . ten seconds later , gelhaus had put seven bullets in the boy . " the family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision , " said the lopez family 's attorney . " if there was ever a case where charges were warranted , it was this one . " but ravitch said her office pored over more than 1,000 pages of reports and spoke to numerous experts to consider " every interpretation of the facts . " now the lopez family 's civil suit , held up by the criminal probe , will " have to run through the legal process , " an official said . ( gelhaus , a firearms expert and instructor , had never fired on a suspect before . )
