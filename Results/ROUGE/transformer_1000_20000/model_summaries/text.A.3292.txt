planned parenthood got some good news from the supreme court on monday , as new justice brett kavanaugh joined the court 's more liberal judges—as did chief justice john roberts—in deciding not to hear a case involving the group . the upshot is that state court rulings will remain in place ; those rulings allow planned parenthood to contest laws in louisiana and kansas to defund the organization . if either kavanaugh or roberts had joined conservative justices clarence thomas , samuel alito , and neil gorsuch , the court would have taken up the case , turning it into the first major abortion test of the new court , reports politico . lawmakers in the two states sought to deny public funding to planned parenthood because the group provides abortions . however , federal law already prohibits medicaid funds from being used for abortions , notes npr . in his dissent , thomas blasted the decision . " what explains the court 's refusal to do its job here ? " he wrote . " i suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named planned parenthood . " he contended that the cases at hand " are not about abortion rights " but " about private rights of action under the medicaid act , " per cnn . still , usa today sees the court 's move as a setback for conservative interest groups who have been pushing for action on planned parenthood over the issue of abortion . ( abortion rights groups won a reprieve in iowa earlier this year . )
