president obama and john boehner gave dueling speeches last night , and the news was not good . here 's what the pundits are taking away from it all : if people—or markets—were looking for reassurance , “ they were out of luck , ” observes politico . instead , obama and boehner “ treated viewers to the unsettling spectacle of two leaders talking past , not to , each other , ” with obama even issuing a “ stunning ” plea for people to call their representatives . obama ’ s speech proved this isn ’ t a left vs. right debate . “ it ’ s center vs. right , ” argues ej dionne of the washington post . “ there was nothing remotely ‘ left ’ in this speech. ” with some deft rhetorical touches—like quoting ronald reagan— “ my hunch is that obama ’ s speech spoke more to middle-of-the-road americans. ” but william kristol of the weekly standard thought obama came across as condescending—especially when he said most americans had probably never heard of the debt ceiling . “ it would be nice to have a president who spoke candidly to his fellow citizens as adults , ” he writes . boehner , meanwhile , went “ full-tilt tea party crazy , ” writes joan walsh of salon . he acted as though he and obama had never discussed a deal at all , while demanding a balanced budget amendment—which is “ extraordinarily apocalyptic and insane , ” because boehner knows that can ’ t pass . “ hell , he probably doesn ’ t even want it. ” he ’ s just moving the goal posts on obama again .
