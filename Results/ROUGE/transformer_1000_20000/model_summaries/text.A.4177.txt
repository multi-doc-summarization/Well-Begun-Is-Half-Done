president obama slammed senate candidate richard mourdock 's rape comments on the tonight show last night . " i do n't know how these guys come up with these ideas , " obama said . " let me make a very simple proposition . rape is rape . it is a crime . " he noted " roe vs. wade is probably hanging in the balance " of the election , politico reports . mourdock 's comments that pregnancies from rape are " something god intended " are " exactly why you do n't want a bunch of politicians , mostly male , making decisions about women 's health care decisions , " obama said . " women are capable of making these decisions in consultation with their partners , with their doctors . " meanwhile , asked by anderson cooper whether he still supports mourdock , john mccain said it " depends on what he does , " the huffington post reports . " if he apologizes and says he misspoke and he was wrong and he asks the people to forgive him , then obviously i â€™ d be the first " to support him . mourdock has in fact issued an apology . mitt romney , for his part , still supports mourdock , though his campaign says he " disagrees " with the indiana republican 's comments : " we disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest but still support him . " the campaign says it has n't called on mourdock to withdraw ads featuring romney .
