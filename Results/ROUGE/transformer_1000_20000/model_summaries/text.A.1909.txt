each day , more than 3,000 children under age 5 die from preterm birth complicationsâ€”meaning that , for the first time ever , premature birth is the biggest killer of young children around the globe . a new study in the lancet finds that of the 1.1 million such deaths in 2013 , 965,000 of them were a direct result of being born too early , with the child dying within 28 days of birth . but another 125,000 deaths happened between the age of 1 month and 5 years , according to a press release . meanwhile , the overall mortality rate for children under 5 has declined since 2000 , as vaccines , antibiotics , and other advances have reduced deaths from pneumonia , measles , and other causes . " the success we 've seen in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases demonstrates that we can also be successful if we invest in prevention and care for preterm birth , " says a researcher . the first step , which is already underway with $ 250 million in new funding : figure out what causes preterm births . obesity , high blood pressure , and later-in-life motherhood are all risk factors , but the exact trigger for premature labor remains a " mystery , " the telegraph reports . the countries most affected are often poor : india has the highest number of deaths from preterm birth complications , followed by nigeria and pakistan . but even in the us , 28 % of under-5 deaths are caused by such complications , which is above the global average of 17.4 % ; the us has " one of the worst preterm birth rates of any high-resource country , " the press release notes . among the new research initiatives : identifying the electric signals that trigger labor and figuring out whether that process is initiated by the mother or the fetus .
