stephen allwine allegedly had no moral objection to sleeping with women other than his wife , but he was opposed to divorce—or , at least , his church was . it 's for that reason that he tried to arrange his wife 's murder through the dark web and finally killed her himself when no other killer appeared , prosecutors allege . at the start of allwine 's murder trial in minnesota this week , prosecutors claimed the united church of god elder began having affairs through the ashley madison website , which he learned about while counseling married couples at church , reports the minneapolis star tribune . since his church views marriage as a lifelong commitment , per the washington post , prosecutors believe the then-43-year-old allwine decided his wife should be killed and paid $ 6,000 in bitcoin to dark web site besa mafia , which claimed a link to organized crime . though law enforcement officials now suspect besa mafia was a scam , they warned the couple that user " dogdaygod " was plotting amy allwine 's death . stephen allwine then bought a gun , which was found next to his wife 's body in the couple 's cottage grove home three months later on nov. 13 , 2016 . prosecutors say allwine drugged amy , 43 , with scopolamine , shot her in the head , and staged the scene to look like a suicide—failing to erase gun residue from his hand and traces of blood leading from the scene . a computer search also linked him to " dogdaygod , " prosecutors say . allwine 's defense attorney , on the other hand , says the prosecution has only theories and alleges police contaminated the scene by moving the gun before photos were taken , per the pioneer press . " just because he had an affair does n't mean he killed his wife , " he says of his client , per the post .
