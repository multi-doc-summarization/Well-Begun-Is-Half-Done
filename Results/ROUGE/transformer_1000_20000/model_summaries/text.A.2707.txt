your instagram account may know you 're depressed before you do , according to a new study out of harvard and the university of vermont . the daily dot reports researchers taught a computer to analyze aspects of instagram photos , such as colors , brightness , and faces , then set in to analyzing nearly 44,000 posts from 166 people . the instagram users in the study took a clinical depression survey and were asked about any history of depression , according to fortune . cnn reports the computer program was able to correctly detect depression from a person 's instagram account 70 % of the time . that 's better than humans looking at instagram photos and better than the success rate of general practitioners diagnosing depression . researchers found the instagram posts of depressed people tended to be less saturated , darker , and more blue . depressed people tended to use the inkwell filter most often ( non-depressed people preferred valencia ) and got more comments on their posts ( non-depressed people got more likes ) . depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo . because the computer program was able to detect depression in instagram users before the were even diagnosed with it , researchers believe it could be a new way to screen people for depression before they start showing more serious symptoms and get them help earlier .
