you think stonehenge is impressive ? archaeologists in britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure , though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland . a henge is a circular earthwork , and the one in question is marden henge , which sits a few miles north of stonehenge in wiltshire . national geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres . the guardian writes that the henge was " far larger than the avebury or stonehenge circles , and too large for any imaginable practical use . " but over the ages marden henge 's berms have " slumped " and farmers have worked the land , and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking stonehenge . until now . jim leary of the university of reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site ; his excavations ( he worked at the site in 2010 , too ) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years . he hopes the berms will help explain the " insane , utterly unsustainable " construction boom that led to marden henge and four other nearby neolithic monuments , including stonehenge . " not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places , " says leary . so far he 's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside marden henge , per the bbc ; fancy arrowheads ; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs , suggesting a huge feast was held there . " for all the attention that has been lavished on stonehenge over the years , we may well find out that marden was where it was really at during the neolithic , " he says . ( there 's a giant " super henge " under stonehenge . )
