another fatal police shooting from last month is getting attention , and the police department involved released body camera video footage from the incident wednesday , the fresno bee reports . dylan noble , 19 , was killed in fresno , calif. , on june 25 after police responded to a 911 call about a man walking around with a rifle . while in the area , officers pulled over noble 's pickup ; they say noble was " peeling out " and continued to drive after they signaled him to stop . after pulling into a gas station , noble got out of his truck and walked toward the officers . the video shows him repeatedly ignoring officers ' commands to stop and to show both his hands . officers believed noble , who repeatedly reached toward his waistband , was armed ; they ultimately shot him twice after he yelled " i [ expletive ] hate my life " and continued toward them . after " pleading " with him to show both hands , officers shot him two more times while he was already on the ground . it was ultimately determined that what noble had in his hand was a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of clear plastic with something resembling gray clay inside ; the department of justice is analyzing it . fresno police chief jerry dyer says the department is investigating and that he will focus on whether the third and fourth shots were " absolutely necessary . " as the washington post reports , soon after noble 's death , people pointed out on social media that the shooting was n't getting as much attention as the deaths of alton sterling and philando castile , presumably because noble was white . ( at a vigil the day after his death , there were confederate flags and a " white lives matter " sign present . ) now noble 's father tells the guardian the new video shows police were " trigger-happy , " and his mother has started the process of suing the city , the bee reports . in addition to the internal investigation and the doj , the county da 's office and the fbi are also investigating .
