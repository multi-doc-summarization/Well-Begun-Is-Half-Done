few things are more italian than baking pizza in a perfectly smoldering wood-fired stove , so san vitaliano 's move to ban the beloved practice comes as a surprise . the town of 6,000 north of naples has some of the worst air pollution in italy—il mattino says its air quality is worse than beijing 's , while naples is " a perfumed garden " in comparison—but environmental tests have failed to identify the source . in an effort to " take maximum precautions to ensure the problem does n't deteriorate , " mayor antonio falcone has banned " agricultural , artisanal , industrial , and commercial producers … from burning solid biomass such as wood , woodchips , coal , and charcoal , " unless filter systems are in place to eliminate 80 % of pollutants , reports the local . the rule will be in place until at least the end of march , reports the bbc . the local reports the plan is to relieve the rule in july , august , and september—the situation is poorest in winter , falcone says—but most pizzerias and bakeries will be forced to change their fuel sources , buy expensive filters , or face fines up to $ 1,100 . " shocking , it 's so ridiculous , " a rep from a local pizzeria tells il mattino . " we make about 34 pizzas a day , how do they think we are responsible for the pollution problems around here ? " " we ca n't be the cause of the smog , " a local who protested outside san vitaliano 's town hall on sunday adds , per corriere della sera . " naples has many more pizzerias than san vitaliano but does n't have the same pollution levels . it 's clear that they do n't want to pinpoint the real cause . this order is a very costly mistake for us . " the bbc reports san vitaliano residents saw 114 days of unsafe air levels in 2015 , compared to naples ' 86 .
