if someone tries to sell you unmarked or homemade skin cream , just walk away . that 's the message the california department of health is sending to consumers , after identifying at least 60 cases over the past four years of state residents getting mercury poisoning from such creams , the san francisco chronicle reports . in a public health advisory yesterday , it revealed that analysts had found creams from mexico designed to lighten skin , fade blemishes , and treat acne contained as much as 200,000 times the legal limit of mercury . the problem is n't a new one . the fda and various state health departments have in recent years issued similar warnings , sounding the alarm about creams not just from mexico , but from many countries . it warned customers to look for ingredients like " mercurous chloride , " " calomel , " " mercuric , " " mercurio , " or plain old " mercury . " the products use mercury , health canal explains , because it suppresses the production of melanin in skin , lightening it . but it takes a long time for absorbed inorganic mercury to leave the body , so repeated use can raise the risk of harmful effects . indeed , the chronicle notes that a 16-year-old who used one such cream to treat his acne ended up in intensive care for nearly a month due to poisoning .
