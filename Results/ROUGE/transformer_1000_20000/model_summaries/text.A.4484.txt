matt white was grocery shopping in memphis , tenn. , when 16-year-old chauncy jones asked if he could carry white 's groceries to the 30-year-old 's car in exchange for a pack of doughnuts . little did chauncy know that he was about to change his life . he told white that he had taken a bus to the " rich people 's kroger " in the hope of getting some food , since his own fridge was empty . " he looked ashamed , hungry , and broken , " white writes on facebook . so instead of buying him doughnuts , " i went on a shopping spree " for cereal , pizza , milk , soap , toothbrushes , and more . but when he drove the boy home with the haul , he discovered chauncy and his disabled mother were truly living with " nothing , " he writes , per fox 13 . " they did n't even have beds or furniture . they were sleeping on pads made out of sleeping bags , they had two lamps and nothing in their fridge . " white decided to help the family even further . chauncy " is a straight a student who is doing his best to make it in a world with no money and very few resources . he wants to work and help his mother financially , " he writes on a gofundme page he set up to raise $ 250 so chauncy could buy a lawn mower and start mowing lawns for money . two weeks later , more than $ 273,000 has been raised . " i did n't know this much love could exist in one place , be aimed in one direction , but seen and felt and empowered by so many people , " white says , per usa today . the money will be put in a trust for chauncy 's education and perhaps a new home . mother and son are now living in a hotel over security concerns , but are " getting better now , " chauncy tells wmc news . " something told me to go to kroger . god told me to go to kroger . " ( the internet rallied for this veteran scammed out of his life savings . )
