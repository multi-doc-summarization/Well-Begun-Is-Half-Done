a man in algeria apparently picked a terrible way to get attention on social mediaâ€”and now he 'll pay for it in prison . on monday an algerian court sentenced the unnamed man to two years after he posted to facebook a photo of himself dangling a baby out of a 15th-story window in an attempt to get " likes , " reports al arabiya english . the photo shows the baby being held by a single hand outside the apartment building in the capital city of algiers over the caption " 1000 likes or i will drop him . " the bbc reports that other social media users quickly denounced the photo , and police charged the man with endangering the life of a child when they arrested him on sunday . the man , who is a cousin of the baby 's , swears the whole thing was a misunderstanding . the independent reports he told algeria 's ennahar tv the photo was manipulated by facebook users to make it look worse than it actually was , claiming the " protective barriers " that were present were digitally removed . the boy 's father also said he believed the man was just being playful and asked the court for mercy . last week another man was jailed over photos shared to facebook .
