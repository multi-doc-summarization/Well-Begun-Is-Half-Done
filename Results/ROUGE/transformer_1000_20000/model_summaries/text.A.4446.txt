kanye west is , apparently , $ 53 million in debt , but he should be able to pay that off in no time thanks to a gofundme campaign started by 36-year-old minnesotan jeremy piatt , cnet reports . " recently , kanye let us in on his personal struggle . he is 53 million dollars in debt and it does n't look like he 's going to get mark zuckerberg 's help that he desperately needs , " piatt writes . " we must open our hearts and wallets for kanye today . sure he is personally rich and can buy furs and houses for his family , but without our help , the true genius of kanye west ca n't be realized . " so far , after just a single day of fundraising , $ 603 has been raised for kanye ( along with a lot of comments like , " how about you get a job ? " ) . piatt tells mashable that he 's spoken to gofundme , and only kanye or his team will be able to access any money raised . as for zuckerberg—west specifically asked him , as well as larry page , to donate money to the kanye cause when he went on his twitter rant , and then went on to imply that he knows other tech giants who should help him . " all you dudes in san fran play rap music in your homes but never help the real artists… , " he tweeted , followed by , " all you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help… . " the guardian did a little investigation into how many " tech guys " kanye actually knows , and found that he really does have something of an ongoing relationship with facebook and apple ; has had meetings with investors in silicon valley and even had some of them at one of his parties ; has had interactions with an instagram co-founder , the dropbox chief executive , a co-founder of rap genius , and elon musk ; and is good friends with venture capitalist ben horowitz . ( here are some of the dumbest gofundme campaigns ever . )
