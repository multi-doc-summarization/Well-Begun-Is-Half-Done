the latest strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to give researchers sleepless nights are n't the most common—or even the most antibiotic-resistant—but they have an ability that could make them a serious danger to public health . they contain enzymes known as " oxa-48-like carbapenemases " that can break down antibiotics and transfer that ability to normal bacteria in the body through mobile pieces of dna , reports the washington post . and live science . the enzymes have been nicknamed the " phantom menace " by researchers because they can be tough to detect . in a report issued this week , the cdc says it identified 43 cases in the us involving the superbug between june 2010 and august of this year , mainly involving people who had traveled overseas , though some cases are thought to have been transmitted in the us . " this is a tricky drug-resistant bacteria , and it is n't easily found , " cdc director thomas frieden tells the post . " what we 're seeing is an assault by the microbes on the last bastion of antibiotics . " the number of cases is small but rising , frieden says , warning that what has been detected so far could just be the " tip of the iceberg . " an infectious disease specialist tells live science that while the bacteria should n't be a major worry for the general public right now , doctors and patients should be aware that the best way to combat antibiotic resistance is to try to be more sparing in the use of antibiotics . ( a mutation spreading in china has prompted warnings of an " antibiotic apocalypse . " )
