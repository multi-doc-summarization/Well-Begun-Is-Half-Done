in what appears to have been a spelling error and not a play on words , donald trump slammed china 's " unpresidented " seizure of a us underwater drone in a tweet saturday morning . " china steals united states navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to china in unpresidented act , " he tweeted . he eventually corrected the spelling to " unprecedented . " the ap , which describes the thursday incident in the south china sea as one of the most serious encounters between the us and chinese militaries in years , reports that china announced earlier on saturday that it is in talks with the us about " appropriately handling " the issue . pentagon spokesman navy capt . jeff davis told reporters friday that the drone was seized while collecting scientific data near the philippines . " it is ours . it 's clearly marked as ours . we would like it back , and we would like this not to happen again , " davis said . the guardian reports that in his friday press conference , obama warned trump against letting relations with china enter " full conflict " mode with a belligerent stance on taiwan and other issues . " the idea of 'one china is at the heart of their conception as a nation , " obama said , " and so if you are going to upend this understanding , you have to have thought through what are the consequences .
