richard grenell 's first day on the job may not have gone exactly how he imagined it . the brand new us ambassador to germany arrived in berlin on tuesday , and in the span of little more than an hour , three things occurred : grenell handed his credentials to germany 's president , president trump announced the end of america 's participation in the iran nuclear deal , and grenell raised some german ire . it 's all due to this tweet , made shortly after trump spoke : " as @ realdonaldtrump said , us sanctions will target critical sectors of iran ’ s economy . german companies doing business in iran should wind down operations immediately . " reuters notes grenell has himself long-opposed the nuclear deal . that sentiment aligns with the white house's—indeed , grenell , a former fox news contributor who page six notes had an " a-list " going away bash , subsequently tweeted that he directly lifted the language from documentation provided to him by the administration . but the washington post observes that " the timing and tone struck some german politicians , journalists and businessmen as offensive and inappropriate . " it characterizes the tweet as coming off as a threat and rounds up plenty of reaction , including this from the leader of the country 's social democratic party : " it ’ s not my task to teach people about the fine art of diplomacy , especially not the us ambassador . but he does appear to need some tutoring . " grenell , the administration 's top-ranking openly gay official , fills an ambassadorship that has been empty for 16 months .
