now that former nazi prison guard jakiw palij is out of the us , the new york times explores how he got in , and it was n't through his efforts alone . as nazi records of his ss membership were n't uncovered until the 1990s , palij successfully applied for a visa under the displaced persons act at the american consular office in schweinfurt , germany , in june 1949 alongside jaroslaw bilaniuk , whose ss identification number turned out to be only one digit away from palij 's , says peter black , a former justice department historian who worked on nazi deportation cases . both claimed to have worked in germany during the warâ€”palij as a factory worker , bilaniuk as a farmhand . mykola wasylyk , who also served with the men at the trawniki labor camp and who 'd already arrived in the us after securing a visa , vouched for both . the records suggest palij and bilaniuk were n't coerced into joining the ss as palij later claimed , but volunteered together in february 1943 . together with wasylyk , they guarded prisoners who made uniforms and brushes at trawniki , says black , a camp known for having executed 6,000 jews in a single day in november 1943 . upon their arrival in the us , palij and bilaniuk settled 100 miles from wasylyk in queens , ny . bilaniuk and wasylyk would each die in the us , even after officials uncovered their true past . deported to germany this week at president trump 's direction , per reuters , palij is unlikely to face charges .
