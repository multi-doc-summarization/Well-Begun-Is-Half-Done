if everything goes to plan with china 's space program—which so far everything has since the country launched its first astronaut in 2003—it will become the first country to land a probe on the " dark side of the moon , " the ap reports . this week , zou yongliao of the chinese academy of sciences announced plans to send a probe designated chang ' e 4 to the moon 's far side by 2020 , according to the asia times . " china will be the first to complete the task if it is successful , " zou said . in 2013 , china became the third country to land a probe—chang ' e 3—on the moon , following the united states and soviet union . china plans to study the geology of the far side of the moon—which is never visible from earth—in order to put a radio telescope there . the dark side of the moon would be ideal for studying radio waves because the moon itself blocks any interfering waves coming from earth . however , that also makes landing a probe on the moon 's far side more difficult , according to the international business times . without radio signals from earth , china will require additional satellite technology to communicate with the probe . in the meantime , the ap reports that china will be sending an unmanned spaceship to and from the moon to collect samples in 2017 . ( nasa recently captured an amazing shot of the far side of the moon . )
