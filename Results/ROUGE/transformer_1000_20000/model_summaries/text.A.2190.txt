the new york times has a deep dive on how walmart bet big on its business by investing in its employees . in 2015 the retailer quietly implemented a new focus on employee welfare , increasing pay across the board and developing programs to make the management track more accessible to employees . although the program has n't helped walmart 's struggling stock price , it has allowed walmart to increase sales , increase employee satisfaction , and claw back some trust and loyalty from consumers . according to its official fact sheet , walmart pledged $ 2.7 billion over two years to increasing employee pay and benefits . the nyt reports that so far , the initiative has raised the average pay for a full-time non-managerial employee to $ 13.69 an hour , a 16 % increase since 2014 and above average pay for retail employees . however , some business leaders and analysts remain skeptical . writing for bloomberg , columnist megan mcardle notes that for a large , publicly held company like walmart , profitability looms above all . if the company 's renewed focus on worker welfare does n't start paying real , quantifiable dividends , shareholders will push for it to return to a cheaper business model , even if that means relying on fewer workers .
