if you had to name two banks guilty of selling lousy mortgage packages during the financial meltdown of 2008 , it 's doubtful you 'd tick off the names nomura holdings of japan and the royal bank of scotland . but as reuters reports , a federal judge yesterday declared that both lied through their teeth when selling their deals to the government-owned entities of fannie mae and freddie mac . us district judge denise cote of manhattan , who decided the case on her own , framed it in straightforward terms in a line that wall street critics will love : “ the magnitude of falsity , conservatively measured , is enormous. ” other banks such as goldman sachs and bank of america opted to settle rather than go to trial , with nomura and rbs the first two to do so . legal experts tell the new york times that they might have been less worried about their reputations taking a hit in the us because they were foreign banks . nomura plans to appeal , with no word yet from rbs . the ruling puts the banks on the hook for about $ 500 million in penalties , though that 's only about half of the original claim by the government , reports bloomberg .
