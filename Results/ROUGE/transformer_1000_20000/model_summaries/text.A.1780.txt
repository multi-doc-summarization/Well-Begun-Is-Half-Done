not long after 12-year-old tamir rice was killed by police in cleveland in november , a group of students in nearby akron decided protests were n't enough . so the akron peacemakers , an anti-violence youth group , brainstormed with the local pd to come up with a double-sided crib sheet of tips for kids to follow when interacting with cops , npr reports . the " you and the law " cards , set to be doled out to all akron middle school and high school students—and possibly to adults , and internationally , in the future—feature 15 bullet points outlining " basic rights and responsibilities , " as well as suggestions to ensure safety during an encounter . " do not 'bad-mouth ' or walk away from the law-enforcement officials , " " control your emotions , " and " do not resist arrest for any reason " are some of the tips . the top of each card mentions the " easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble . " the cards have sparked a debate over whether the police are escaping their own responsibility in confrontations , npr notes . but the kids involved say the point is to de-escalate the situation , not let cops off the hook—and there are phone numbers on the back to report police misconduct . " instead of cussing [ a police officer ] out , i can just say , 'ok . let me calm down , ' and then at a later time , call the police station , " one student tells npr . akron mayor don plusquellic says the cards serve as a common-sense refresher . " some people do n't think about 'oh , what happens when i reach in for my license , ' " he said at a presentation of the cards , per cleveland.com . billy soule , whose son was stopped by cops years ago with a toy gun , works with the youth group as a city rep. " officers surrounded the boys with guns drawn and told them to go down to the ground , " he says , per the site . " my son is alive today because he listened . "
