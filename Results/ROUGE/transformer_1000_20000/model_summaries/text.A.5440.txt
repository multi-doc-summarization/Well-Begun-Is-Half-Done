the " heinous act " of leaking the draft of pope francis ' long-awaited environment encyclical may have been designed to steal some thunder from thursday 's official launch , vatican observers say—and some think it may have been masterminded by vatican insiders , the ap reports . what the news agency is calling " something of a whodunit " is transpiring inside the holy see after italian mag l'espresso published a 190-page-plus draft of the pontiff 's " laudato si " ( " be praised " ) letter on its website yesterday , confirmed by the vatican to be a draft of the real deal . today the vatican called the posting of the draft " incorrect " and suspended the press credentials of sandro magister , the magazine 's longtime vatican reporter and " most reliable and revered vaticanisti , " per his own chiesa website . however , magister claims he 's not the one who obtained or leaked the document—his editor is , he tells the ap . " i just wrote the introduction , " he texted , confirming that he had promised the vatican his lips were sealed about the encyclical , which features francis hitting global warming as being predominantly caused by humans and our insistence on burning fossil fuels . who is under the microscope , according to some observers : vatican conservatives who wanted the pope to keep his nose out of science and stick to church doctrine . the ap cites la stampa , an italian daily , as saying that those old-school conservatives do n't appreciate the pope 's attempts at reform . some commentators say the leak may have been planned to devalue thursday 's launch , which will be assisted by decidedly non-church-affiliated professionals , including an atheist scientist and an economist , per the ap . ( this is n't the first ugly vatican leak . )
