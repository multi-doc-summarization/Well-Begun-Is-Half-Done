when harvard suspended its men 's soccer team last week for the rest of the season due to an " appalling " system of ranking female players , one of the reasons the school gave for its harsh punishment was the fact that team members were n't exactly communicative and cooperative at first ( the team as a whole has since apologized ) . per inside higher ed , the men on the school 's cross-country team were obviously paying attention to the smackdown : now members of that roster have come forward to admit to their own past spreadsheets ( some containing " sexually explicit " remarks ) describing female athletes and compiled each year before a dance held with the women 's cross-country team , the harvard crimson reports . the cross-country team 's documents included speculation as to which guys would get an invite to the dance from which girls , with some comments referring to the women 's weight or other physical attributes . and per correspondence between alumni seen by the crimson , even former and current team members acknowledge how bad past spreadsheets were , with one noting , " hahaha dude 2012 was the absolute worst . " team captain brandon e. price , who on saturday emailed the team to " come clean " about any female rankings , says the team has tamped down the lewdness since a 2014 spreadsheet the team was " particularly ashamed of . " the school 's athletic director says in a statement : " harvard athletics does not tolerate this sort of demeaning and derogatory behavior , and we will address any credible information we receive . " ( a response from some of the former female soccer players . )
