" the real wife of the 57 year-old actor is easily at least 50 . but this f -- -er wants to be tv married to a 38 year-old -tops , " she wrote , adding that the characters involved are in a first marriage , so no , this is n't a situation where the female character is a " re-wife . " per e ! news , she refused to name the actor , but did say he 's considered an " american treasure . " ( this situation is not a first . )
