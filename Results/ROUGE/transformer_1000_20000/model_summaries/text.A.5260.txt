though one of the most well-known dinosaurs , tyrannosaurus rex is actually somewhat of a mystery , having suddenly emerged as a fearsome beast some 80 million years ago . as a 20-million-year gap in the fossil record preceded t. rex , paleontologists have known little about its evolutionary path—until now . the discovery of 90-million-year-old fossils belonging to a previously unknown relative shows t. rex likely developed brains before size , reports new scientist . discovered in uzbekistan in 2012 , timurlengia euotica 's large brain and ears used for balancing and hearing low-frequency sounds were " almost identical to t. rex , " which also shared certain bone features , researcher stephen brusatte tells the bbc . yet timurlengia was only " the size of a horse " and weighed less than 500 pounds . " only after these ancestral tyrannosaurs evolved their clever brains and sharp senses did they grow into the colossal sizes of t. rex , " weighing over five tons , brusatte tells the telegraph.timurlengia was " evolving features that would eventually allow t. rex to become this super-dominant top-of-the-food-chain animal , " he adds . " tyrannosaurs had to get smart before they got big . " researchers still do n't have a full picture of timurlengia after uncovering 25 sections of its skeleton—they do n't know the length of its arms , for example—but say the " nimble pursuit hunter " had long legs and was a fast runner . timurlengia also had " slender , blade-like teeth suitable for slicing through meat " and " probably preyed on the various large plant-eaters , especially early duck-billed dinosaurs , " an expert says . ( one creature alive today has teeth like t . rex . )
