much-maligned black rats and their fleas have long been blamed for spreading the black death that claimed millions of lives in europe over the course of a few hundred years , but scientists now have a new critter they think was at fault . by studying tree rings to learn about precise climate fluctuations during the multiple epidemics from 1347 into the 1700s , a team out of the university of oslo is reporting in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that giant gerbils in asia were the more likely culprit . the working theory is that wet springs followed by warm summers in asia prompted gerbil populations to soar , and that within a few years plague bacteria would show up in harbor cities in europe , sweeping the continent from there . " if we 're right , we 'll have to rewrite that part of history , " a researcher tells the bbc . " suddenly we could sort out a problem , " the researcher continues . " why did we have these waves of plagues in europe ? we originally thought it was due to rats and climatic changes in europe , but now we know it goes back to central asia . " next up : sequencing plague bacteria from skeletons across europe . if there 's considerable genetic variation in the disease , this will support the theory that new strains kept arriving from asia , as opposed to persisting in rat reservoirs in europe . though not what it once was , hundreds of cases of the plague are still reported annually , with 126 deaths in 2013 , reports the world health organization . ( check out what some researchers call the plague 's silver lining . )
