vladimir putin got to sound off against the us in a new york times op-ep this week , so now a russian news site is offering the same opportunity to john mccain . joking about putin 's op-ed on cnn last week , mccain said , " i would love to have a commentary in pravda . " foreign policy asked pravda for comment . " if john mccain wants to write something for us , he is welcome , " says the english editor of the website pravda.ru . " mr. mccain has been an active anti-russian politician for many years already . ... but we would be only pleased to publish a story penned by such a prominent politician as john mccain . " mccain says he really would like to write something for pravda , and will get in touch . but slate suggests that mccain should actually check out the news outlet he has agreed to write for . there are two pravdas : pravda the newspaper , a soviet-era relic which mccain probably remembers from the cold war ; and pravda.ru , a tabloid news site that features headlines like " russian children get gay love books from the west , " and " sos signal from ufo sows panic in siberia . " so ... not quite russia 's answer to the new york times after all .
