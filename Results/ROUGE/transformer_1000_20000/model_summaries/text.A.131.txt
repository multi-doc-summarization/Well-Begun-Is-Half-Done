potential homeland security chief kris kobach has a thing to learn about keeping his own documents secure : the kansas secretary of state was photographed with his " department of homeland security kobach strategic plan for first 365 days " clearly visible before a meeting with donald trump on sunday , the ap reports . the parts of the plan that were visible included a revival of the national security entry-exit registration system , or nseers , for people from high-risk nations , which he helped create in 2002 . " all aliens from high-risk areas are tracked , " states his hard-line plan , which also includes " extreme vetting questions for high-risk aliens " on subjects like sharia . his plan also calls for the us to stop accepting syrian refugees . the visible parts of the plan suggest that kobach 's vision for homeland security matches donald trump 's campaign rhetoric , including a " rapid build " of the border wall , politico reports . kobach has been advising trump on issues like immigration , and the transition team says they met sunday " to discuss border security , international terrorism , and reforming federal bureaucracy , " the topeka capital-journal reports . it 's not clear whether his carelessness with his documents will affect his chances of heading homeland security . " that 's the height of irony if he 's wanting a job in homeland security and you 're able to see in a photograph what should be confidential information , " says kansas senate minority leader anthony hensley . ( trump has told the british that he thinks nigel farage would be a great ambassador to the us . )
