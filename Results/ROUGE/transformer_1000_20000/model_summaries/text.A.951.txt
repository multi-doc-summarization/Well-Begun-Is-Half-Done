like low-status neanderthals , contemporary men who are n't exactly winners—literally , when it comes to playing video games—are more likely to harass women online , new research cited in the washington post finds . scientists who conducted the study published in plos one played 163 games of halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players ( 82 female , 81 male ) with remote teammates and opponents . the study gauged a remote player 's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths . researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male , and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts . but lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent , caustic comments . a lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior : after all , the post notes , players can remain anonymous , they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again , and it 's a significantly male-biased recreation . females threaten gamers ' " pre-existing social hierarchy " ; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest . " as men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status , the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female 's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank , " the study notes . such gamer communities mirror male-dominated industries—such as engineering or the tech field—and may promote sexist actions in real life , scientists warn .
