after a social media campaign—and an avalanche of bad publicity—a drug company has done a u-turn and agreed to give a dying 7-year-old boy an experimental drug that could save his life . the fda allows " compassionate use " of unapproved drugs in such cases , but the chimerix pharmaceutical company had insisted that giving the drug to josh hardy , who developed a bone marrow disorder after cancer treatment , would delay efforts to get it to market , cnn reports . chimerix president kenneth moch says josh will be the first patient in a pilot trial for the drug . " being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating , and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make , " says moch , who tells the fredericksburg lance-star that he and his employees have received death threats amid a flood of pleas to help the virginia boy . josh is expected to receive the drug within 48 hours , though his mother fears he is running out of time . " even though he is frail , he has a very strong will about him , " she tells fox news . " but things just keep stacking against him , and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery . "
