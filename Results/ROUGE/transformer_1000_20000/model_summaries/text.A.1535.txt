the daughter of the man seen as second only to adolf hitler in nazi germany has died at age 88 . gudrun burwitz , the oldest child of heinrich himmler , was famous in her own right , however . when she was a child , himmler frequently brought her to public events " as a blond , blue-eyed symbol of aryan youth , " in the words of the washington post . in her later years , she was believed to have been a member of the group stille hilfe ( silent help ) , which provides assistance to former ss members and their families . gudrun , who was detained temporarily after the war and testified at the nuremberg trials , never denounced her father or the nazi regime , reports the bbc . with her death , the german newspaper bild has uncovered a nugget that has caused a stir in germany : for about two years in the 1960s , gurdrun worked for what was then west germany 's spy agency . " the bnd confirms that ms burwitz was a member of the bnd for a few years until 1963 under an assumed name , " says an official with the agency . she worked there while the agency was run by a former nazi military intelligence commander . the bnd still exists as the unified germany 's foreign intelligence agency , and deutsche welle notes that its use of former nazis in eastern europe after the war remains controversial . one item in wide circulation in gudrun 's obituaries is a diary entry she wrote at the age of 12 after her father took her to the notorious dachau concentration camp . " we saw everything we could , " she wrote . " we saw the gardening work . we saw the pear trees . we saw all the pictures painted by the prisoners . marvelous . " ( himmler 's own diaries were found a few years ago . )
