seth owen was over the moon when he received what appeared to be the path to his " life goal " of going to college : an acceptance letter from georgetown university . but the florida 18-year-old , who was the co-valedictorian of his senior class , had his hopes dashed when he later received his financial aid package from georgetown , which had been based on the expected contribution from his family . the problem : he 's estranged from his southern baptist parents , and was essentially forced out of his home , because he 's gay , nbc news reports . owen says his parents found out he was gay when he was a sophomore , made him go to christian-based conversion therapy , and eventually told him he had to keep going to their church—which owen says bashed the lgbt community—or leave . and so in february , he did , crashing with friends instead . he says he was " devastated " when he realized he could n't afford the tuition for his first year at georgetown—annual tuition and fees comes to around $ 70,000 , and owen would have to pay about $ 22,000 of that , per the advocate—let alone for all four years . enter jane martin , owen 's former bio teacher , who says owen always " stood out to me . " martin , who 's also gay , set up a gofundme for her ex-student , who also served as the ring bearer in her wedding . she explained she wanted to " help … bring a rainbow in the midst of seth 's storm " and " make the impossible possible . " the gofundme has so far raised more than $ 82,000—and if georgetown eventually acquiesces and adjusts owen 's financial aid package , martin and owen say they 'll use leftover donations to set up a scholarship fund for other gay teens . owen plans on studying to become a criminal defense lawyer for teens , per wjxt .
