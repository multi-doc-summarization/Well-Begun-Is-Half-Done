if you 're on the hunt for children 's headphones—so-called because they limit the volume of sound that they emit to protect children 's ears—experts are issuing a stern warning : they 're not necessarily safe , even if they purport to be . the wirecutter , a product recommendations site , has just tested 30 sets of children 's headphones and found that half of them in fact do not cap volume at a promised limit , and that the worst of the bunch emit such high volumes that damage can occur in a matter of minutes . " these are terribly important findings , " one pediatric audiologist not involved in the testing tells the new york times . " manufacturers are making claims that aren ’ t accurate . " meanwhile , the wirecutter 's headphones editor tells good morning america that there is n't even a governing board that oversees this . the world health organization has deemed sound below 85 decibels to be safe for up to eight hours , but half the headphones went above this level , and in some instances children can even remove the volume limiter . meanwhile , one in five teens suffers from hearing loss , according to a 2010 report in the journal of american medical association , and some docs blame headphones . " we ’ re really talking about listening to a rock concert on a daily basis , " one otolaryngologist tells abc news . so which headphone set came out on top ? the wirecutter recommends puro bt2200 , which are bluetooth wireless headphones that 'll set you back $ 100 . ( back in 2008 , researchers predicted an 'epidemic ' of hearing loss thanks in part to headphones . )
