charlie sheen 's hiv diagnosis was joked about in an email exposed , but never publicized , during last year 's sony hack , the washington post reports . the email from a sony exec was joking about the fact that sheen was n't showing up to work on anger management , his fx series . " i think i will win the 90/10 bet on the over under on this … it 's hard to to be a drug addict and be hiv positive and do 40 eps a year , " the email reads . it 's always been available on the wikileaks sony hack page , but had n't been released to the larger public until now . the email was referring to a deal that stated if 10 episodes performed well , fx would order 90 more ; the series , which premiered in june 2012 and ended in december 2014 , was supposed to film 100 episodes in two years , enough to send it into syndication—and it did end up filming exactly that many . as the post notes , the email illustrates the fact that some in the industry were very much aware of sheen 's diagnosis before he revealed it publicly . deadline notes that sheen is currently looking to do another tv series .
