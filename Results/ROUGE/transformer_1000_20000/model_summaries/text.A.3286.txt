the zika virus ' apparent effect on fetuses is on shocking display in a new study in the new england journal of medicine that was rushed to publication given the virus ' spread . though it offers no definitive link between zika and fetal abnormalities , the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and " the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development , " reports the verge . the study centers on a 25-year-old slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in brazil in february 2015 . she developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy , but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues . when she returned to slovenia in october , however , doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted , per nbc news . an autopsy found the full genome of the zika virus exclusively in the fetus ' unusually smooth and scarred brain , suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue , per reuters . the mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects . " you have a mother who 's infected , a fetus that 's abnormal , and in the fetus , you have the genetic signature of the virus , " says an infectious disease expert . " this is clear data showing zika can infect the fetus . " an epidemiologist adds " it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly . " scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks , leading one doctor to suggest that zika , like other viruses linked to birth defects , may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy . ( the virus has been linked to other health problems . )
