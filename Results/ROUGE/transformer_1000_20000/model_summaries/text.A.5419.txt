golf may be " a good walk , spoiled , " but at least it does n't spoil your life expectancy . in fact , a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket , reports the wall street journal . researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports , and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled , shot guns , played cricket , or golfed . " engaging in cycling and rowing ( high cardiovascular intensity ) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket ( low cardiovascular intensity ) , " says the study . one theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise . " over time , this will result in an accumulation of damage , which can be explained as a form of aging , " says a study author . you can read the original bmj article here .
