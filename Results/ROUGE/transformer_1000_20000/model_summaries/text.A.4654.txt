new york city terror suspect sayfullo saipov was allegedly quick to reference isis , while the militant group stayed mum . that 's changed . reuters reports the islamic state claimed responsibility thursday in its own al-naba paper for the attack , saying that the 29-year-old is " one of the caliphate soldiers . " although investigators are still looking into saipov 's background , the criminal complaint against him says he told officials he was glad he 'd carried out the attack , gained inspiration for it by viewing isis propaganda clips on his phone , and wanted to put up an isis flag in his room at bellevue hospital , where he 's recovering after being shot in the abdomen by nypd officer ryan nash . cnn reports that isis did n't use saipov 's name in its claim and offers no evidence to back that claim up , including any showing that isis helped plan the attack or even knew about it beforehand . the site notes the wording is similar what it used after the pulse orlando shooting and a 2016 attack in nice , france . cnn adds this is the first time isis has posted such a claim first in its newspaper rather than via its amaq news agency . per abc news , the isis statement also mentioned that the attack took place " close to the monument for the 9/11 raid " and , oddly , claimed that " 60 crusaders " were killed or injured in the halloween attack ; the official count so far is eight dead , around a dozen wounded .
