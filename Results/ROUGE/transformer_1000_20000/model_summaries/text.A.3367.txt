yellowstone national park usually sees about one bear attack a year , though until this week there had n't been one since 2015 . that changed thursday , after a 10-year-old was charged at by one , though thanks to his parents ' quick thinking and a canister of bear spray , it appears he 'll be ok. that 's per a press release from the park , which details how a family of four was walking along a trail southeast of old faithful thursday morning when a bear emerged from the vegetation and barreled after the boy as he started to run away . the bear caught up and knocked the boy down , at which point his parents " deployed bear spray about 5 feet from the bear 's face . " the bear then " shook its head " and retreated . the boy was taken to a local clinic , then to montana 's big sky medical center , where he was treated for wounds to his buttocks , a hurt wrist , and puncture wounds on his back . park officials say they 're trying to figure out what type of bear attacked him , with fox news noting both black bears and grizzlies live in the park . the casper star-tribune reports there have been a handful of other animal attacks at yellowstone this year , including by bison and cow elk . ( a man caught on video taunting a bison at yellowstone just got jail time . )
