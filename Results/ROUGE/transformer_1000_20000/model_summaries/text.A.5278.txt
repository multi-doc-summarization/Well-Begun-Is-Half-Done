the details of the story are hazy , but what 's certain is this : an 11-year-old was suspended from school in virginia after school officials in late september found what they believed was a marijuana leaf in his backpack , along with a lighter . ( a suit filed in the case alleges the assistant principal found " crumpled leaves . " ) the boy , identified only as rmb , was suspended for 364 days for alleged " possession of marijuana , " and he faced charges in juvenile court . turns out , however , that three tests found the leaf was n't pot at all , and the juvenile charges were dropped , the roanoke times reports . but things with the school were n't so simple : only now , six months after the case began , has rmb been able to return to class at a different school , and he remains on probation . that time away has taken a toll . the son of bruce and linda bays of bedford county , both teachers , used to be an easygoing , upbeat child . now he gets panic attacks , suffers from depression , and fears authority figures . after a disciplinary hearing , his mother tells the times , " he just broke down and said his life was over . he would never be able to get into college ; he would never be able to get a job . " he 's being treated by a psychiatrist , and his parents have launched a federal lawsuit against bedford county schools and the county sheriff 's office . but the suit could face a hurdle when it comes to school drug policy : it also bans " imitation controlled substances , " defined as a " pill , capsule , tablet , or other item which is not a controlled substance . " in the meantime , it remains unclear how the leaf got in rmb 's bag . the inquisitr points to concerns about " zero tolerance " school policies , noting that this month , a 6-year-old was suspended for shaping his hand like a gunâ€”and it was n't the first such suspension .
