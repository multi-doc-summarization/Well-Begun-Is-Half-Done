it 's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms : how long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the earth to the other ? the new answer : 38 minutes and 11 seconds , reports science . the result is courtesy of mcgill university graduate student alexander klotz , whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the american journal of physics . the reason for the shorter time ? unlike previous calculations , klotz 's take into account that the earth 's layers have different densities , and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man , notes phys.org . " the way the earth is structured , the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core , to about 110 % of its surface value , before getting weaker as you move through the core , reaching zero at the center , ‚Äù says klotz , as quoted in forbes . ( if it 's all a little too hypothetical , try physics-inspired pasta instead . )
