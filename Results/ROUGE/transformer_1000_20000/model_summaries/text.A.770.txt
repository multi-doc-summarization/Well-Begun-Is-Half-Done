the push for a higher minimum wage just got a major boost courtesy of los angeles . the city council has approved raising it to $ 15 an hour by 2020 , reports the los angeles times . under the plan , the rate will rise from $ 9 to $ 10.50 in july 2016 , then tick up annually to $ 12 , $ 13.25 , $ 14.25 , and $ 15 . businesses with 25 or fewer workers will get an extra year to phase it in . though a handful of other cities have voted for a $ 15 rate , including seattle , los angeles is the biggest city to do so . the move does n't become official until the city attorney 's office drafts an ordinance and sends it back to council members for their approval , but once it does , it 's going to affect a lot of people , notes the new york times . the newspaper cites one study showing that about 40 % of workers in the city make less than $ 15 an hour . the city 's chamber of commerce predicts layoffs as a result . " it 's simple math , " says one official . " there is simply not enough room , enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time . " but one longtime mcdonald 's worker , a mother of two now making $ 9.05 an hour , tells the guardian that the move is overdue . “ my life would be completely different if i were paid $ 15 an hour , " she says . " i could afford groceries without needing food stamps , my family could stop sharing our apartment with renters for extra money , and i ’ d be able to provide my daughters with some security . ”
