the us speedskating team is still without a medal after an awful start in sochi , and the squad hopes it can turn things around by changing suits . the team has officially sought permission from the olympic powers-that-be to ditch their fancy " mach 39 " suits made by under armour and revert to older suits when competition resumes tomorrow , reports the wall street journal . the mach 39 suits , never before used in competition , were supposed to have a whiz-bang design that would boost speeds , but now many think they 're actually slowing the skaters down , reports the chicago tribune . the blame-the-suit sentiment apparently is n't unanimous among team members , but if the switch is made , all members would have to abide . the official word from us speedskating chief ted morris avoids blaming under armour but suggests the issue is in skaters ' heads : “ we don ’ t think ( the suits ) are having any impact but at the same time we want to make sure when our athletes get on that start line they have confidence and are ready to go . " under armour , meanwhile , can at least take solace in that it also makes the older suits .
