al jazeera america launches this afternoon , and while some analysts believe the channel 's entry to cable line-ups is a development as important as the launch of cnn or the fox news channel , others wonder if the new channel and its formula of serious , in-depth news will ever be able to attract more than a handful of viewers . the channel has decided to focus heavily on us news , and its " seemingly limitless financing " from the qatari government may be " its biggest strength and its most remarked-upon weakness , " writes brian stelter at the new york times . with 900 staff , it is " one of the most significant investments in tv journalism in modern times , " he notes . the channel has bureaus in new york city ; washington , dc ; los angeles ; san francisco ; dallas ; detroit ; chicago ; denver ; miami ; seattle ; nashville ; and new orleans . the channel 's chief executive has promised " less opinion , less yelling , and fewer celebrity sightings , " reports the guardian , which notes that its 16-person investigative team sets it apart from peers like cnn , which recently ditched its entire investigative team . advertisers , however , seem wary , and aja will start out with just six minutes of commercials per hour . former al jazeera english reporter dave marash believe aja 's focus on solid news will help it make its mark . " almost all of their hires are respectable people with real careers and real records , " he tells the ap . " several are flat-out outstandingâ€”sheila macvicar is outstanding . i 'm optimistic . " other major hires include john seigenthaler , joie chen , and antonio mora . but the new channel faces plenty of hurdles : it will be available in fewer than half of us homes ; and like current tv , which it replaces , cable systems have given it high-numbered channels unlikely to draw in many channel viewers . some americans are still suspicious of the al jazeera name , as well .
