charles darwin 's finches of the galapagos islands—renowned as a poster child for speciation ( that 's " the process by which new species arise , " explains smithsonian ) —may not be able to evolve fast enough to stave off extinction , according to a study published last week in the journal of applied ecology . the medium ground finches of santa cruz island are having their newly hatched babies decimated by philornis downsi , a parasitic nest fly humans brought to the islands half a century ago . the flies lay their eggs inside the birds ' nests , and the hatching maggots feed on the young birds . " this is like a really bad horror flick , " study author dale clayton says . " the babies ca n't withstand even one night with these parasites . " according to discovery news , the flies were first spotted in the finches ' nests in 1997 . since then , the population has been growing , and none of the galapagos islands is free of the flies . researchers looked at five years of field research on the medium ground finches specifically on santa cruz and came up with three scenarios—good , bad , and neutral—based on breeding , weather , and food supplies , discovery news reports . in both the bad and neutral scenarios , the finches have less than 100 years before they 're extinct . according to smithsonian , the same fate is likely facing some of the other 14 species of darwin 's finches . " if darwin 's finches go extinct , it will be because people brought this fly to the islands , " clayton says . " if the fly had gotten to the island more gradually , perhaps , maybe the birds would have had more time to adapt . " researchers believe a 40 % reduction of nest infestations could save the finches and are looking at options to accomplish that , discovery news reports . ( a frog named for darwin has already gone extinct . )
