in a season of seemingly endless snow , new jersey towns are running out of rock saltâ€”and 40,000 tons of the stuff is supposed to be on its way . trouble is , the shipment is stuck in maine because the vessel that would carry it does n't have an american flag , as is required by the 1920 federal maritime act , which states that any shipment from one us port to another must be on a us-made ship piloted by a us crew , to help ensure a thriving merchant-marine fleet , new york times reports . " we were pursuing a waiver " to the law , " but we 've been advised we would n't get one , " a rep for new jersey 's transportation department tells the washington free beacon . the maine shipment may now arrive in several installments , the transportation spokesman says . one possibility would see a pair of barges carrying the salt in a weeks-long process , says the head of the department , per new jersey 101.5 . meanwhile the east coast has been hit by three winter storm systems in one week , and new jersey officials have barely enough salt for one more storm , the morning call reports . the situation is " as frustrating as frustrating can be . people are n't getting the services they need , " jersey city 's mayor tells the daily news . " we need salt and some help with mother nature . "
