the us intends to step up its " non-lethal " aid to the syrian opposition , john kerry announced after a meeting of the " friends of syria " group in rome today . the obama administration will ask congress for $ 60 million in aid , along with food rations , and medical supplies , the bbc reports . " the us decision to take further steps now is the result of the brutality of superior armed force propped up by foreign fighters from iran and hezbollah , " kerry said . but the move does n't go as far as reports yesterday indicated it might , npr points outâ€”there was no mention of body armor , armored vehicles , or military training , for instance . us officials say the opposition has brought up " other needs , " and that it is " keeping that under review . " in the meantime , britain and other nations are likely to provide such equipment , the washington post reports . but despite the caution , one syrian leader expressed optimism , reuters reports . " we heard today a different kind of discourse , " he said .
