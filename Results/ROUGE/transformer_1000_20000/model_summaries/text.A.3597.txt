citing interviews with four anonymous sources , bloomberg reports russian hackers broke into dow jones & co. servers a year or so ago and stole stock information before it was public . dow jones , which is part of news corp and owns the wall street journal , claims it 's unaware of any such hack , despite the fbi confirming the incident to both bloomberg and cnbc . " we are looking into whether there is any truth whatsoever to this report by a competitor news organization , " dow jones says in a statement released to cnbc . the fbi and securities and exchange commission have spent months trying to figure out how hackers could profit from what they stole , concluding they were likely looking for stock tips contained in embargoed information and unpublished stories , bloomberg reports . dow jones admitted to another cybersecurity breach last week in which hackers tried to get contact and payment information from around 3,500 customers . according to bloomberg 's sources , this new hack is more serious than the one dow jones addressed publicly . it 's unclear if the two incidents are related .
