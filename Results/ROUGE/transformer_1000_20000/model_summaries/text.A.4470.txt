long lines at polling sites in arizona 's march 22 primary led phoenix mayor greg stanton to call the night a " fiasco " —and the justice department to now investigate whether there were civil rights violations regarding what stanton called " unacceptably disparate distribution of polling locations , " reuters reports . the doj 's civil rights division penned a letter friday asking maricopa county , the state 's most populous , to determine if federal law was violated regarding , among other things , the number and location of polling sites ( the county cut them from 200 to 60 in 2012 in an apparent bid to save money ) . the justice department 's reason for this request : reports of " disproportional burden in waiting times … in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations , " the letter noted . those waiting times were incredibly inconvenient : the ap notes that some voters waited nearly six hours , with the last vote cast at almost 1am at one site ; polls had closed at 7pm , but voters already in line at that point were allowed to cast ballots . poll workers even reportedly brought pizza to hungry voters . maricopa county has until april 22 to respond to the doj 's letter , which included 10 specific requests for information , including polling locations , procedures , and response to public backlash , the arizona republic reports . " we are going to gather the information … and we will make it public , " the county elections director says . despite these issues , arizona 's secretary of state certified the primary results on monday , calling it for donald trump and hillary clinton , per the ap . ( here 's hoping wisconsin 's big night tuesday goes more smoothly . )
