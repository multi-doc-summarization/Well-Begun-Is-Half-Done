if convicted again of murder , amanda knox says she wo n't willingly return to italy to face punishment ; instead , she told an italian journalist , " i will be—how do you put it ? —a fugitive , " the guardian reports . the reporter , meo ponte , who interviewed her over skype , has previously called knox innocent of the murder of former roommate meredith kercher ; he says her " fugitive " comment was likely a joke , the daily beast notes . but in a statement to the today show , knox was clearer : " ( if convicted ) , legally i 'll be defined a 'fugitive , ' but i will continue to fight for my innocence , " she said . " i will not willingly submit myself to injustice . " such a verdict would need to be upheld by the country 's top court , and even then it 's not clear whether italy would ask the us to extradite her , or how the us would respond ( double jeopardy could be at play , but it 's complicated ) . still , such a comment may not serve her well , the daily beast points out : us officials may now have to keep her on their radar in case she is found guilty . the verdict is due jan. 30 .
