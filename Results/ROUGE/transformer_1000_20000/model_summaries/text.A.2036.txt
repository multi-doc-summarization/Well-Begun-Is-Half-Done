a new alternative to cow milk comes from a source you would n't expect : peas . ripple foods is about to roll out the product nationally , first at whole foods and then at target , reports vegnews.com . " it 's creamy , sweet , and—do n't worry—tastes nothing like peas , " says a post at co.exist . the idea is attracting plenty of buzz because of a slew of positives , the notable one being that the drink has 8 grams of protein per serving , the same amount as milk from cows and eight times the amount of almond milk . " as many non-dairy beverages lack protein , this fact alone may draw consumers , " observes a post at berkeleyside.com . it also has 50 % more calcium than dairy milk , and a much smaller carbon footprint than either dairy or almond milk . " the primary challenge is one of flavor , " says ripple co-founder adam lowry . " if you just make pea milk the way that you make almond milk , with regular yellow peas , you can get a very high-protein beverage , but it frankly tastes terrible . " the company says it has patented a system to keep the nutrients but ditch the pea flavor and color , a method that involves blending it with water , sunflower oil , and stabilizers . if this system proves legit , it could open up all kinds of plants to the process and " disrupt an already disruptive plant-based dairy industry , " notes a post at food dive . consumers can get their first taste at whole foods starting may 2 , with a price of $ 4.99 for a 48-ounce bottle . ( one judge says skim milk is n't really milk . )
