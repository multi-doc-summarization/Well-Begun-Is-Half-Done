nearly 250 years after the boston tea party , we could have a salem coffee party on our hands . the oregon legislature is weighing a tax of 5 cents per pound on wholesale coffee , including coffee beans and ground coffee . koin reports that no revenue projection was given in house bill 2875 , but the willamette week 's math suggests it could bring in about $ 2 million a year . ( the state 's budget gap stands at $ 1.8 billion . ) the money would be earmarked for the oregon national guard youth challenge program , alternative high school programs , and primary school reading programs . willamette week sees a disconnect there , reporting that lawmakers typically try to " establish a clear connection " between the tax and what the revenue will do , like property taxes paid by homeowners covering fire services . " the relationship between coffee consumption and alternative education is less clear , " it writes . that said , the bill will go into effect on july 1 , 2018 , if it receives a three-fifths majority in the state house and senate . a rep for house republicans says " a tax on coffee is clearly not a proposal oregonians would support , and we hope democrats will disavow it just as quickly as they introduced it .
