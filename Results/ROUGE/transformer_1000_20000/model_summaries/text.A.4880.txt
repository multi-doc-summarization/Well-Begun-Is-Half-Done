australian power company sp ausnet has n't officially accepted responsibility for a wildfire that killed 119 people near melbourne in early 2009—but it has agreed to pay $ 470 million to survivors in the biggest class-action settlement in the country 's history . some 10,000 plaintiffs accused the firm of negligence after investigators determined that the fire began when an electricity line failed between two poles , causing a live conductor to ignite vegetation , the bbc reports . the ensuing fire was one of several wildfires that killed a total of 173 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes on february 7 , 2009 , which became known as black saturday . the company says the settlement , which still needs court approval , is not an admission of liability , the ap reports . " the conductor which broke and which initiated the fire was damaged by lightning , compromising its fail-safety design in a manner which was undetectable at the time , " it said in a statement . " it is a tragedy that the conductor eventually failed on one of the worst days imaginable . " a lawyer for the plaintiffs says the settlement will bring " a measure of justice and some real compensation to help ease the financial burden of their suffering . " after the deadly fires , rescued koala sam became a symbol of hope—though he died of chlamydia later that year .
