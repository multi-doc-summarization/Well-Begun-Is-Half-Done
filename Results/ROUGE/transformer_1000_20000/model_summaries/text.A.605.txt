a 31-year-old texas man has died from flesh-eating bacteria , the third reported victim to be infected with the rare bug linked to hurricane harvey . josue zurita , a carpenter helping repair flooded homes , died on oct. 16 , six days after he went to the hospital with a serious infection to his upper left arm , khou reports . necrotizing fasciitis had already claimed the life of a 77-year-old houston-area woman ; a man who 'd kayaked through floodwaters to check on neighbors and contracted the bacteria survived , per cnn . dr. philip keiser , the local health authority for galveston county , which announced zurita 's death on monday , says the risk of contracting necrotizing fasciitis is " well within what we would expect " given the amount of construction and resulting injuries after the storm . " you get some kind of break in the skin , and ... it 's a fairly open space where the bacteria can grow , " he notes . the infection can " spread over hours , " keiser adds . several types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis , which kills the body 's soft tissue . the risk of disease following a flood is usually short-lived , per the washington post . but to prevent infection , it 's important to treat even minor wounds by cleaning them thoroughly , then covering them with clean , dry bandages . tetanus shots can prevent infection . zurita was remembered in an obituary as a " loving father and hardworking carpenter " who moved to the us from mexico to support his wife and daughter back home . " he 's a very caring person , " a relative tells khou . " he was very young and always smiling . " ( sewage in floodwaters was a prime culprit for spreading infection . )
