late rapper tupac shakur apparently had plenty of time to reflect while in jail in early 1995 : he wrote a letter to ex-girlfriend madonna explaining the reasons for their breakup , which he said happened partly because she was white , tmz reports . " for you to be seen with a black man would n't in any way jeopardize your career , if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting , " tupac writes in the letter , which can be seen here . " but for me at least in my previous perception i felt due to my 'image ' i would be letting down half of the people who made me what i thought i was . " madonna did n't reveal until 2015 that she used to date tupac , who was killed in a drive-by shooting in las vegas in 1996 , mashable reports . in the letter , tupac tells madonna he never meant to hurt her , saying , " i must apologize to you because like you said i have n't been the kind of friend i know i am capable of being . " he says he has " grown both spiritually and mentally " since their relationship . he also tells her he was hurt by an interview in which she said , " i 'm off to rehabilitate all the rappers and basketball players . " auction site gottahaverockandroll.com plans to auction the letter off later this month , with $ 100,000 as the starting bid . ( another tupac letter from jail sold for more than $ 170,000 two years ago . )
