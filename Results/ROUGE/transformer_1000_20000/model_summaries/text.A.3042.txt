an ice " sensitive locations " directive says federal agents should n't try to enforce the law at such locations except under " exigent circumstances . " but the family of rosamaria hernandez , a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who had gallbladder surgery at a hospital in corpus christi , texas , says ice agents stalked her at the hospital , then took her to a san antonio detention center for migrant kids—all while her parents , also illegal immigrants , are at their home in laredo 150 miles away . arresting a minor already living in the us , especially one with a medical issue , is a move the new york times is calling " rare , if not unheard-of . " it 's also one that 's prompted rep. joaquin castro to issue a challenge to president trump and elaine duke , the acting secretary of homeland security . " show that this enforcement operation is prioritizing a dangerous criminal , " castro says in a statement . this all started when rosamaria—brought to the us from mexico as an infant by her parents , who hoped to get better treatment for her cerebral palsy—was rushed by ambulance from a laredo medical center to driscoll children 's hospital for the emergency procedure . the corpus christi caller-times notes rosamaria was with her cousin , a us citizen . the trip tuesday meant the ambulance passed a border patrol checkpoint , and while agents let the ambulance go , they followed it , her family says . ice agents hovered outside rosamaria 's room until she was released , then took her to the san antonio detention center , leticia hernandez , an attorney for the family , tells newsweek . now , while rosamaria 's family and lawyers vie for her release from the center , only us citizens can visit her , per newsweek . " the only thing this child wants is her mom , " hernandez says .
