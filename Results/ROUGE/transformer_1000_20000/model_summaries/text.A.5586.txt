a canadian woman looking for her missing daughter since she went missing as a toddler almost 40 years ago received a facebook message in early august that may change her life , the ottawa citizen reports . the private message sent to liliane cyr , who maintains a facebook page dedicated to finding her daughter yohanna , who disappeared from their montreal apartment in 1978 , was from a us woman who started off asking a very specific question about a birthmark on yohanna 's finger , followed by this : " i 'm not 100 % sure , but i think i might be your daughter . " the woman told cyr that the discovery that her birth certificate was a fake , an odd lack of early childhood photos , and fuzzy memories of a plane ride led her to suspect something was amiss in her past . the montreal gazette tells the story of what happened the week yohanna disappeared , with 20-year-old cyr leaving 18-month-old yohanna in the care of aaron lewis guay , her us boyfriend at the time , while she was out of town for work . guay met up with cyr a few days later without the baby , first telling cyr his mom was watching yohanna , then saying the toddler had drowned in the tub and he 'd buried her . guay was charged with kidnapping , but he denied his original story and a judge ruled there was n't enough evidence to go on with the case ; he was released and disappeared . cyr says she 's trying not to get her hopes up , but she notes that photos of the woman resemble yohanna . dna tests are in the works . ( two teens missing for two years were found on a minnesota farm . )
