" after a thorough review , it became clear we had built clubs in some locations that impacted other clubs , and where population had not grown as anticipated , " wrote sam 's club ceo john furner in a company email . it was n't immediately clear how many people would lose their jobs . " we will work to place as many associates as possible in new roles at nearby locations , and we 'll provide them with support , resources , and severance pay to those eligible , " wrote furner .
