" a youcaring fundraising page for the girls explains that they were given just a 20 % chance of survival when their parents learned about their condition at an ultrasound on jan. 13 , 2014 ; the girls were born early , at 31 weeks , weighing an estimated 3 pounds , 7 ounces each . " you ca n't have hope without faith , and you ca n't have faith without hope , " mom elysse told khou last year , explaining their names . " and if one baby would have gone , the other would , too . and so right away i knew you have hope and faith . " now she says , " we are so grateful to all the surgeons and everyone who cared for our daughters and gave them the incredible chance to live separate lives .
