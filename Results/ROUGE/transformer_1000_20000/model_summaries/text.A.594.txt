russia is staging war games in belarus in september , but us officials and us allies in the area are concerned the country 's real aim is to bring military equipment into the country and leave it there . " people are worried this is a trojan horse . they say , 'we 're just doing an exercise , ' and then all of a sudden they 've moved all these people and capabilities somewhere , " the head of us army forces in europe tells reuters . he says nato officials will be watching the zapad 2017 exercise closely for that reason . some allies think the exercise will involve nuclear weapons training and could utilize more than 100,000 troops , which would make it the largest such exercise since 2013 , the guardian reports . the official did note that there are no indications russia really is planning such a " trojan horse , " but called for more transparency from the country as to the size and scope of the war games in order to ease concerns . a senior russian diplomat says moscow has no plans to leave military equipment in belarus , and says the concern from nato is just " artificial buffoonery " over routine war games that is " aimed at justifying the sharp intensification of the nato bloc ( activities ) along the perimeter of russian territory . " nato is also keeping a close eye on war games in the baltic sea taking place july 24-31 ; chinese warships were to join the russian navy there friday .
