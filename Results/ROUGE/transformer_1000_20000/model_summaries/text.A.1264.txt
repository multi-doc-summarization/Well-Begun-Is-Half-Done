a mother in chile claims a local hospital is keeping her away from her newborn daughter simply because she smoked marijuana a few days before giving birth , the ap reports . " they have violated my rights as a mother , " the bbc quotes sindy ortiz . " i use this drug only for the pain in my arms , it was recommended by a medical professional to me , and i am absolutely not a drug consumer . " according to the ap , ortiz says the hospital is only letting her see her infant for two hours per day and wo n't allow her to breastfeed her . this is all standard protocol , according to the hospital . the hospital states it was required to alert a local court when ortiz tested positive for substances that could be harmful to her baby , the ap reports . the hospital is maintaining custody of ortiz 's daughter , at least until a hearing scheduled for thursday . according to the bbc , chile 's congress easily approved a bill to decriminalize the personal use of marijuana earlier this year . but it could still be years until the law is put into place .
