" hey i just wanted to tell you and mom i met a really great guy and we â€™ re running away together , " one message to her father said . " i love him and we 're leaving tonight i 'll call you later when we get to where we are going . " " he showed it to me and i immediately knew that it was someone else , " mother sharon gold tells action news jax . " we text each other all day ... and this was not from my daughter . " says father daniel gold , " the spelling was all whacked out . " after gold 's car was found in the restaurant 's parking lot with a slashed tire and her purse still inside , authorities identified manager lee rodarte , 28 , as a suspect because of inconsistencies in his story . police say rodarte , who was in an on-again , off-again relationship with gold , eventually admitted killing her and led them to her body , which he had dumped in a lake . investigators believe rodarte was the one who sent the text to gold 's parents . her parents say after the disappearance , he told them he was worried about her and even helped hand out missing-person flyers . he has been charged with murder and evidence tampering and is being held without bond .
