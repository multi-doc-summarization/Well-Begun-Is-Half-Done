on at least one aspect of health care , the world 's most advanced nations can now take a back seat to cuba . the world health organization says cuba has become the first country to eliminate mother-to-baby transmissions of hiv , reports nbc news . the same holds true for syphilis . cuba did so not through some experimental treatment but through rigorous prenatal screening of pregnant women . those who tested positive were given hiv drugs before and after giving birth , and their newborns were treated as well . when that happens , the percentage of infected babies falls to under 1 % . " eliminating transmission of a virus is one of the greatest public health achievements possible , " says who chief margaret chan . " this is a major victory in our long fight against hiv and sexually transmitted infections , and an important step towards having an aids-free generation . " cuba 's policies did n't completely wipe out such transmissions—two babies were born with hiv in 2013 , and five with syphilis—but the numbers met who 's criteria for certification , reports reuters .
