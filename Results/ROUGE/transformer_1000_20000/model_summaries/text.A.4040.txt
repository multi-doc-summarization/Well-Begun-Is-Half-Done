microwave weapons ? that 's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the american embassy in cuba . but now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea—based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect—is bogus . kenneth foster is a professor of bioengineering at penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study . at scientific american , he assesses what 's known about the cuban ailments and lays out why it 's " wildly implausible " that microwaves are to blame . for one thing , any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims , too , and that did n't happen . instead , foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely . " it is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices , possibly even spytech , but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel , " he writes . foster cites this earlier investigation from the ap revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard , and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other . it makes sense to him that the cubans might have been trying to listen in on americans with these relatively common gizmos . " the incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 us election , and the cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about us intentions . " a cuban scientist , meanwhile , agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched . " first , it was sonic weapons , now microwave , " he told cnn . " what 's next , kryptonite ? "
