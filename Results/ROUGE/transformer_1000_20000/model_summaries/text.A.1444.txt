it 's been 43 years since gilbert hyatt applied for a patent on a machinery-control system , and 35 years since he sought a patent related to liquid crystal displays . it takes an average of about two years to get patent approval—but hyatt has n't received it on either invention , bloomberg reports , meaning his could be the oldest pending applications in existence . the 76-year-old inventor filed a lawsuit in january to push for official action . the problem , according to an outside patent lawyer : the patent office fears embarrassment . officials worry they " might issue a broad patent that would have a sweeping impact on the technology sector . rather than be embarrassed , they ’ re just bottling it up . " it 's unclear how much such patents could cost technology companies . a previous patent hyatt received—which took a mere 20 years to be granted—shocked the tech industry by initially offering him a claim on most microprocessors . the patent was later partially revoked , but hyatt still made a likely $ 150 million after a deal with dutch firm royal philips nv to license that and other patents , bloomberg notes . now he says he 's getting the " runaround " from the patent office . at the huffington post , an economist puts him among " the fathers of the microcomputer " and calls him a prime example of the challenges faced by independent inventors . but a tech historian notes that " innovations are more than ideas ... if gilbert hyatt had never existed , i believe the microprocessor would have developed in the same way that it did .
