" she ca n't go to a beauty parlor , she ca n't go shopping to a department store , she ca n't go to a restaurant , she ca n't even go to mcdonald 's . she ca n't do anything . " the orlando sentinel notes that mason says anthony does n't live alone , and is n't romantically involved with anyone . anthony—who accused her father of sexually abusing her— " does not have any blood family anymore " and the family she has now consists of members of her defense team . mason says he thinks she " wants to speak out " ; anthony declined cnn 's request for an interview , however . " i know she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her . i also know she 's very saddened by her loss and she will never forget her daughter caylee , ever , " mason says . his book , justice in america : how prosecutors and the media conspire against the accused , will be released this summer . mason—the third attorney associated with the case to write a book—says it will include information never revealed before , and will go beyond the anthony case to explore broader legal issues .
