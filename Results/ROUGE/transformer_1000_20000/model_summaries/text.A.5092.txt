authorities are swarming the small upstate new york town of willsboro to find the two convicted killers who escaped from prison last week , reports the wall street journal . a motorist spotted two men walking on a " very rural " road last night , and they took off into the fields when he stopped , say police . willsboro is about 35 miles from where richard matt and david sweat busted out of the clinton correctional facility . more details are filling in on the great escape , too . the leading theory is that a female employee of the prison who worked with the two men in its tailor shop smuggled in a small electrical saw and perhaps other tools such as a sledgehammer , reports the albany times union . the woman also may have provided access to a cell phone after striking up a relationship with matt . the men reportedly used the saw to cut holes in the metal walls of their cells , and the holes " led to a cavernous utility bowel inside the prison where the men spliced an electrical cord into a light fixture to power the saw they then used to cut a large hole in a 24-inch steam pipe that led to a sewer outside the prison , " the albany paper reports . the final barrier to freedom was a lock on the inside of a manhole cover , which they bashed with a sledgehammer . authorities say the woman or someone else might have had second thoughts and scrapped a plan to pick them up friday night . this is matt 's third escape attempt , his son tells the buffalo news . the first was from a prison near buffalo in 1986 ( he climbed a wall and remained free for five days ) and the second was in 1997 after he got captured in mexico . â€œ he said he made it up to the roof of the prison and got shot in the shoulder , " says his son , who adds that his father has a " genius iq .
