the " special relationship " between the us and the uk is still back-slappingly good , according to david cameron . president obama has said " the special relationship is stronger than it has ever been privately and in public and i agree , " the british prime minister tells the daily mail , revealing that obama sometimes calls him " bro " when they talk on the phone . the term is more commonly associated with frat boys than world leaders , but the independent has decided it 's still " a step forward " from george w. bush 's " condescending " greeting for tony blair : " yo , blair ! " in the mail interview , cameron , who faces a tough election battle in may , also discusses gay marriage—he 's proud of introducing the legislation and says he will probably attend a same-sex wedding soon—and his own marriage . he says samantha cameron is the first person he turns to for advice on difficult decisions like sending in special forces to rescue hostages . " if she 'd organized napoleon ’ s march on moscow , they would have reached vladivostok in good time , " he says .
