wednesday saw what could be the world 's largest-ever pearl ; thursday , a massive gold nugget weighing in at around 9 pounds . found in central victoria 's golden triangle in australia by an explorer who wishes to stay anonymous , per abc.net.au , the gleaming chunk of precious metal , estimated to be worth up to $ 190,000 , was found 12 inches below the surface using what gizmodo australia calls a $ 7,600 minelab metal detector known as the " next level of gold detection . " " i thought it was rubbish at first , maybe an old horseshoe , " says the prospector , who 's been scouting for buried treasure in his spare time for 10 years with a group of friends , per 9news . but as he dug deeper , the finder of the nugget now being called " friday 's joy " realized he had n't just stumbled across some junkyard-worthy detritus . the prospector , who had found a 9-ounce gold nugget the previous day , initially was n't sure what to do with this substantially larger find—discovered , incidentally , in a location that had already been " worked over , " a minelab rep tells australiamining.com—so he rinsed it off with water , wrapped it tinfoil , and stuck it in his oven for the night . for now , the gold piece remains secure in a bank vault until it can be sold at auction , and the prospector , who has promised to split the proceeds with his metal-detecting group , is planning to use his share to buy a van so he can travel around his home continent . his lucrative new lucky charm is still far from being the world 's biggest : per the discovery channel , that honor goes to the 158-pound " welcome stranger " nugget found in dunolly , victoria , in 1869 . ( once found in a plane toilet : 32 gold nuggets . )
