" the risk increased by 11 % for every 10 grams a day of intake , about six drinks per week , " the study 's author says . previous research has suggested the alcohol-cancer link , and that waiting to have kids could increase your risk . but this is the first study to focus on alcohol in the pre-pregnancy period . breast tissue is especially vulnerable to carcinogens during that window , science codex explains .
