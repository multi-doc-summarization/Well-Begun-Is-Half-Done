going scuba diving specifically to spot great white sharks maybe already did n't sound like a super safe idea , and after watching the terrifying video captured by a california man on vacation in mexico , you may take it off your bucket list once and for all . the man captured the moment a great white shark managed to break into , and then quickly out of , a cage that had a diver inside at the time . the diver emerged unscathed , and the man who shot the video explains to abc news that the shark was not being aggressive . " these awesome sharks are biting at large chunks of tuna tied to a rope , " he explains . " when a great white shark lunges and bites something , it is temporarily blinded . they also can not swim backwards . so this shark lunged at the bait , accidentally hit the side of the cage , was most likely confused and not able to swim backwards , it thrust forward and broke the metal rail of the cage . " so go ahead and put shark viewing back on your bucket list , we guess .
