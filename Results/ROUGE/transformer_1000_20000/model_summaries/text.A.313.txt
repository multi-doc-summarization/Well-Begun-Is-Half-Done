last night was derek jeter 's last all star game , and it went beautifully , as the yankee captain went 2-for-2 with a double . there was just one problem : that double might have been a gim me . after he left the game , adam wainwright said that he was n't exactly gunning for jeter . " i was going to give him a couple of pipe shots . he deserved it , " wainwright said . " i did n't know he was going to hit a double or i would have changed my mind . i thought he was going to hit something hard to the right side for a single or an out . i probably should have pitched him a little bit better . " jeter laughed off the comments . " if he grooved it , thank you , " he said . wainwright backed off the remarks before the game was even over , saying he was joking . " i feel terrible about this if anyone 's taking any credit away from derek jeter , " he told fox sports reporter erin andrews . " it was mis-said . â€¦ i hope people realize i 'm not intentionally giving up hits out there . " the cardinals ace is still sure to come under fire this week anyway , jerry crasnick at espn predicts , though he thinks wainwright did baseball a favor " by exposing the massive problems inherent with what the all-star game has become in recent years . if there were any doubt , commissioner bud selig 's 'this one counts ' initiative has outlived its usefulness . "
