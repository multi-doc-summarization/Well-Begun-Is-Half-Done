eliot spitzer is back on the political scene—just like mark sanford and anthony weiner—and apparently tearing up over his past transgressions this morning on morning joe . which makes politico wonder : what makes these guys tick ? the simple answer , from washington insiders , is egomania . " the essential thing that these politicians all have is an absence of shame , " says journalist sally quinn . " this is strictly about ‘ me , me , me , ’ and it ’ s a neediness that i don ’ t understand but we see all the time in washington . " a political psychologist agrees , saying the new runs for office are attempts to redeem bruised egos : " it ’ s not that the public needs ... them back in office . it ’ s much more that they need to be back in office . " how some are reacting to spitzer 's run for comptroller : whether or not spitzer stands a chance , wall street wo n't want to see him back again , politico notes . " he ’ s had these legendary duels and battles with a number of people in the sector , ” says an industry official . “ should he be elected , you ’ ll just have another official who ’ s antagonistic towards the sector . " indeed , as a financial manager for new york city , he 'd have a powerful weapon against corporate heavyweights . spitzer 's own argument is that he 's a gutsy progressive ; he notes his backing for gay marriage in 1998 . " i ’ ve been ahead of the curve . i ’ m not a traditional politician . i am not one who takes the measure of a political issue and calibrates to the public opinion , " he tells politico . " i ’ m tough enough to stand up and do what needs to be done . " adds a former bush administration official : " when people say his name , it ’ s usually preceded by a four-letter word . "
