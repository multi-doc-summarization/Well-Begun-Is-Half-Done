last friday was a normal " mommy-daughter " day for tracy anderwald and her 5-year-old daughter , allison . the two were playing marco polo in a backyard pool in portland , texas , but the next thing anderwald knew , she was waking up in a nearby hospital without a clue as to how she got there , reports the corpus christi caller-times . home surveillance footage on youtube and the shy voice of little allison tell the story of a close call—anderwald had suffered a seizure in four feet of water and , after a few minutes lying motionless on the bottom of the pool , allison knew it had been too long and dragged her mother to the shallow end , where she rolled her body over . anderwald 's sister , tedra hunt , was walking to the house as allison pulled her mother to the shallow end , and footage shows the girl running for help as soon as her mother 's face was out of the water . " the doctors explained to us that had tracy been underwater any longer , she probably would n't be with us right now , " hunt , 32 , tells abc news . " it is truly amazing that this little girl , who ’ s actually also pretty small for her age , was able to save my sister . " hunt says their father , who died two years ago , was a " guardian angel ; " anderwald , 34 , will undergo neurological tests to figure out what caused the seizure , which she 'd never had before . the sisters are sharing their story in the hopes of demonstrating the importance of teaching children to swim . allison , their " little mermaid " and " little hero , " has been swimming since she was a toddler . ( this skilled dartmouth swimmer drowned . )
