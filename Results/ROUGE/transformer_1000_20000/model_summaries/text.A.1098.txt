three years ago , mitt romney wrote that president obama should " let detroit go bankrupt , " instead of bailing out the struggling auto industry , in a famous new york times column . and today ? even with the american auto industry on the rebound , michigan 's gop primary looming on feb. 28 , and rick santorum breathing down his neck in the polls , romney still thinks bankruptcy would have been better than the president 's " crony capitalism , " he writes in the detroit news . " i believe that without his intervention things there would be better , " he writes . romney 's big complaint with the bailout ? that " secured creditors " got screwed and non-union employees had their benefits slashed while a union-controlled trust got 55 % of chrysler and the unions had their pensions saved . " it is not the american way of making cars , " writes romney . none other than former president george w. bush is taking the opposite side in the post-mortem , saying that he was responsible for the first $ 25 billion bailout , and it was definitely a good thing . “ i didn ’ t want there to be 21 % unemployment , ” bush told the national automobile dealers association last week , reports the washington post . " sometimes circumstances get in the way of philosophy . ”
