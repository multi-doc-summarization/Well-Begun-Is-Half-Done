president obama staked his presidency on the afghanistan war last night , but pundits are widely split on how convincingly he made the case for escalation . this was no george w. bush on an aircraft carrier , writes matthew cooper in the atlantic . this was a community organizer turned war president , " making a compelling , " almost kissengerian " argument that just like with health care we need to spend now to save later , cooper notes . " the worst major speech of his presidency " left joan walsh at salon deeply pessimistic about the chances of success in afghanistan . obama failed to give any convincing reasons why we are escalating the fight in afghanistan now , and did n't seem all that convinced himself , she writes . obama 's " strangely schizophrenic " emphasis on the possibly incompatible goals of victory and a speedy withdrawal is unlikely to go down well with either liberals or conservatives , and wo n't persuade the undecided , writes ross douthat at the new york times . the president barely seemed to mention military strategy , he notes . obama showed " a steely resolve " that had been lacking before , writes richard cohen at the washingon post . the president showed it is possible to urge a nation to war " using reason and logic , facts and figuresâ€”and not by waving the bloody shirt of patriotic fibs , " cohen notes .
