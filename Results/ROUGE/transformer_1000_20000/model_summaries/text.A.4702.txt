the polls this week were right : mitt romney easily won the nevada caucuses tonight , just as he did four years ago , report the ap and cnn . that 's two straight victories for the frontrunner . the more interesting battle was that for second place : romney took 42 % , but ron paul at times looked poised to trounce newt gingrich . gingrich prevailed in the final tally with 25 % , paul with 18 % , and rick santorum had 13 % . as he did after his south carolina win , romney addressed supporters and put the focus on the white house rather than his rivals . " president obama seems to believe america 's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past , " he said . " i believe the 21st century will be and must be an american century . " next up after tonight : tuesday night caucuses in minnesota and colorado , and a primary in missouri . ( no delegates will be awarded in the missouri contest , and gingrich is n't even on the ballot , notes the washington post . )
