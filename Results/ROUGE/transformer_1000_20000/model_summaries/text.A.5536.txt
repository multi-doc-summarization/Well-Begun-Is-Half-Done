new hampshire may be forced to hold its gop primary as early as dec. 6 , and it will be all nevada 's fault for moving up its caucus date , the granite state 's top election official warns . secretary of state william gardner says new hampshire has no intention of surrendering its tradition of being the second state to choose a nominee , and the combination of state laws and the christmas holiday make dec. 6 or 13 the only realistic dates for a primary if nevada refuses to move its date back by at least three days , politico reports . iowa 's caucus is set for jan. 3 , and nevada 's is schedule for jan. 14 . the parties " can discourage other states from trying to leapfrog onto our tradition , " gardner said in a statement . " right now , the problem is the date of nevada . we can not allow the political process to squeeze us into a date that wedges us by just a few days between two major caucus states . " mitt romney is expected to win in both new hampshire and nevada , but an early december win in new england will leave a long time , and probably a big loss in iowa , between victories , notes nate silver at the new york times .
