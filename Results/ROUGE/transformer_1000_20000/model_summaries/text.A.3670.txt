a new lifetime reality show is raising eyebrows , especially in the medical community : born in the wild will feature women giving birth outdoors with no medical assistance . the network says it is taking " extreme precautions " to ensure safety , including having an emergency professional on standby and a hospital within range . first-time mothers wo n't be allowed to take part , but obstetricians say it still is just too risky . " i understand everybody wants to believe we overmedicalize pregnancy and that it 's a natural process . but it 's a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life , " a maternal-fetal medicine specialist tells entertainment weekly . a lifetime exec says the network has set out to document something people are already doing . it 's not as if " we 're dropping people in the woods and saying 'go have the baby , ' " he says . " these are all people who have already had babies in hospitals who had unsatisfying experiences and who are choosing to have different experiences . " at salon , mary elizabeth williams is n't impressed by the " completely insane " concept or by lifetime 's press release describing childbirth as the " craziest experience " of a woman 's life . " i 'm not going to get whipped up over whether a woman wants to give birth in a hospital or a swimming pool or on a pile of leaves , but i do find the premise of having an entire film crew around to document and televise the experience does somewhat undercut the whole 'in the wild ' thing a bit , " she writes . " and i definitely find lifetime â€™ s branding of childbirth as an insistently 'crazy ' event spectacularly offensive . "
