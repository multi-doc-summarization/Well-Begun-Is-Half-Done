does your toilet paper seem smaller to you these days ? well , you 're not crazy : it is . as the washington post reports , toilet paper squares used to be 4.5 inches by 4.5 inches . nowadays , they 're up to a half-inch narrower , shorter—or both . ( apparently , it 's enough of a difference to be noticeable to the naked eye : last week , a reader wrote in to the los angeles times complaining about a " 26 % reduction in surface area . " ) and , as consumer reports noted last year , the cardboard tubes are also increasing in diameter as the number of sheets per roll decreases . but the price is not falling : in 2012 and 2013 , the unit price rose about 2 % per year . ( in 2013 , the wall street journal explained that the process of selling less paper for the same price is known as " desheeting . " ) " a standard roll is much smaller than it used to be , so now they 're selling double rolls . so , without being scientific , i think a double roll is pretty well equivalent to what a standard roll was perhaps a decade ago , " a research analyst tells npr . one not-as-obvious reason for the tp trend is that companies that make toilet paper also make products like paper towels and napkins . though toilet paper is essential—americans are estimated to use an average of 46 sheets per day , and that 's probably not set to change any time soon—paper towel and napkin sales are falling . in particular , large companies , like offices and restaurants , are moving toward things like air dryers or , the analyst explains , rationing how many napkins they dole out to customers . but they 'll never cut down on their tp orders in an attempt to ration that particular product , so orders will remain steady . ( as for those hand dryers , you might not want to use them . )
