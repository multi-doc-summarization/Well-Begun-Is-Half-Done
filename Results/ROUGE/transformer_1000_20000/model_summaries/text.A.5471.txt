as donald trump continues to trade volleys with latinos , he took his unrepentant show to phoenix last night , where he told an enthusiastic crowd that waited hours in 100-degree temps that " we have to take back the heart of our country " and that he was " ready to go right at the mexican government . i ’ m going to charge them $ 25,000 per illegal immigrant and , oh , i ’ ll make them pay . " trump used the 70-minute speech , which the washington post characterizes as more a " stream-of-consciousness rant than a presidential-style stump speech , " which " put an exclamation point on his bombastic push " to focus on immigration . " these are people that shouldn ’ t be in our country , " trump told the crowd of between 3,500 and 4,200 . " they flow in like water . " he also took the opportunity to further hammer away at gop golden boy jeb bush , saying , " let 's say he 's president—oy , yoy , yoy . how can i be tied with this guy ? he 's terrible . terrible . he 's weak on immigration . " bush was n't trump 's only whipping boy : also attracting the candidate 's scorn , per the post , were " macy ’ s , nbc , nascar , caroline kennedy , hillary rodham clinton and , several times , the media . " ( the candidate avoided attracting neil young 's wrath again and left the stage to " we 're not gon na take it " by twisted sister . ) trump spoke earlier in the day to a libertarian crowd in las vegas , notes the ap , striking a slightly more nuanced tone : " i love the mexican people . i respect mexico greatly as a country . but the problem we have is their leaders are much sharper than ours , and they 're killing us at the border and they 're killing us on trade . " ( even as trump spoke , mexico was having a little trouble keeping a notorious drug lord on lockdown . )
