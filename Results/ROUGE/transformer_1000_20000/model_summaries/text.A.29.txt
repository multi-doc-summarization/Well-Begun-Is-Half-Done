david plouffe is making the talk-show rounds this morning , and cnn reports that he 's wasting zero time in bashing newt gingrich for accusing president obama of politicizing the trayvon martin killing , and dismissing the gop nomination race at large as a " clown show . " gingrich " is clearly in the last throes of his political career , " said plouffe , and instead of exiting " with some shred of dignity , " has " clearly chosen " to " say these irresponsible , reckless things . " " i think the president spoke movingly about this tragedy , as a father , " plouffe said . " so i think those comments were really hard to stomach , really , and i guess trying to appeal to people ’ s worst instincts . " elsewhere on the plouffe dog-and-pony show , as per politico : on paul ryan 's budget : " if mitt romney is the nominee , then this really is going to be the romney-ryan plan . he said he 's going to rubber-stamp it . " on being " confident " health care reform will be upheld by the supreme court : " by the end of this decade , we are going to be very glad the republicans termed this obamacare , because when the reality of health care is in place it will be nothing like the kind of fear mongering that was done . " on the white house 's gay marriage stance : " we don ’ t even have a platform committee . we are going to work through the platform process . "
