a connecticut-sized swath of oxygen-deprived waters off the gulf coast is a " poster child for how we are using and abusing our natural resources , " says one researcher in louisiana . in its 30th annual survey , the louisiana marine consortium shows the dead zone has shrunk to about 5,000 square miles and may have stabilized , reports reuters . ( it previously measured as many as 8,200 square miles . ) still , the gulf coast dead zone remains second in size only to one off finland ; it extends along the louisiana coastline from the mississippi river delta to the border with texas . since the 1960s , nitrogen fertilizer , mostly from midwest cornfields , has been drawn into streams and rivers by rainwater and poured straight into the gulf via the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers , the times-picayune explains . there it feeds algae blooms that turn oxygen into carbon dioxide when it decays—poor conditions for fish and shrimp . nitrates and nitrogen levels continue to increase , the scientists say . the epa has tried to shrink the dead zone to 1,991 square miles since 2001 and isn ’ t making progress . environmental groups have sued the agency to force its hand in adopting needed regulations to reduce harmful runoff . " we keep being told by both regulators and industry that a hands-off approach … is working just fine , but the dead zone is clearly not going away , " one attorney tells the times-picayune . louisiana legislators claim the dead zone is natural and want to remove its gulf waters from the " impaired waters list , " reports nature world news . activists say similarly harmful algae blooms in both ohio and florida prove current efforts aren ’ t working . ( in other bad news about algae blooms , toxic blooms are so common in ohio that summertime swimming bans are " routine . " )
