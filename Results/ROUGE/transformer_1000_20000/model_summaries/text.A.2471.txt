in the wake of harvey weinstein news , npr 's news chief is the latest to come under fire for alleged past sexual misconductâ€”and he 's now stepped down from his post . michael oreskes , 63 , resigned wednesday , per the ap , after two women told the washington post about incidents in the late 1990s when he was the dc bureau chief at the new york times . both women say while talking to him about possible jobs at the times , he suddenly planted a kiss on their lips and put his tongue in their mouths . when one woman confronted him about it months later , calling it " totally inappropriate , " she says he replied : " i was overcome with passion . i could n't help myself . " neither woman was hired ; they say they were spurred to come forward by the weinstein allegations . in a statement , npr notes , " we take these kinds of allegations very seriously , " though it would n't comment on specifics . meanwhile , npr reports on a current employee now making public her own complaint . science reporter rebecca hersher says she filed a grievance against oreskes in october 2015 after he turned what was supposed to be a career discussion into a " three-hour-long dinner that delved into deeply personal territory . " at that meeting , hersher says , oreskes steered their talk to relationships and sex , even calling one ex-partner his first " sex girlfriend . " hersher says oreskes never touched her inappropriately , and she believes he was held " appropriately accountable " after her complaint . but she notes the talk made her uncomfortable and " undercut my confidence in a way that was surprising to me . " in a statement wednesday , oreske said , " my behavior was wrong and inexcusable , and i accept full responsibility . " npr ceo jarl mohn has appointed christopher turpin as npr 's temporary news chief , per cbs news . more at the post and npr .
