to mandy patinkin , it 's inconceivable that ted cruz has been uttering lines from the princess bride along the campaign trail—and the actor , who played inigo montoya in the 1987 cult film , has had enough . " how can i stop this ? " was patinkin 's reaction when friends started emailing him about images online that featured cruz 's face photoshopped onto his character 's body , he tells the new york times . cruz has long said the movie is his favorite , and he 's committed a good portion of it to memory ( including patinkin 's famous line : " allo , my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die " ) . but patinkin is n't sure cruz understands the film 's subtext : namely that , despite the film focusing partly on his character 's mission for vengeance , the real meaning revolves around the movie 's hero rescuing his true love . " [ cruz ] is not putting forth ideas that are at the heart of what that movie is all about , " patinkin tells the times in a tone the paper describes as " increasingly vexed . " patinkin cites one of his character 's final lines in the movie as one that should stand out more to cruz : " i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it 's over , i do n't know what to do with the rest of my life . " the 63-year-old actor 's beef with cruz is that he 's too focused on that revenge , preying on voter anxiety by , as the times puts it , " exploiting fears about immigrants and muslims . " says patinkin , " open your arms to these people , these refugees trying to get into our country , and open your hearts . " a spokeswoman for cruz 's campaign told the times in an email that " having some fun with a cult classic … should be something we can all get behind , politics aside . " in other words , no " as you wish " from cruz . ( will cruz pull out a princess bride quote during tuesday night 's debate ? )
