in a move that some analysts fear could be the start of a " global currency war , " china 's yuan dropped again today , dragging other asian currencies down with it . today 's drop against the dollar was the second biggest since 1994 , exceeded only by yesterday 's , and the rapid fall has led some to believe that the country is trying to boost exports and create jobs at the expense of rivals like south korea , reuters notes . it 's not clear how long the drop will continue : china has described the devaluation as a " one-off , " and the new york times notes that with $ 3.5 trillion in foreign currency reserves , china certainly has the ability to prevent any unwanted falls in the yuan . a change in the tightly controlled exchange-rate mechanism means the yuan could continue to drop 2 % a day , the ap reports . the imf has welcomed the move as a way to give market forces more control of a currency that china wants to play a bigger role globally , but us lawmakers are skeptical . " for years , china has rigged the rules and played games with its currency , " says sen. chuck schumer , per the ap . " rather than changing their ways , the chinese government seems to be doubling down . " today 's drop in the yuan led to sharp falls in world markets , which analysts believe were caused by fears that china 's economy is in worse shape than previously thought , the guardian reports .
