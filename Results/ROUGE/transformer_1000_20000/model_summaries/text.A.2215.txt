capitol hill has been without a kennedy a full year now after a six-decade run , but that has a decent chance of changing in september : joseph p. kennedy iii is formally " exploring " a run for barney frank 's house seat . " a hail and hearty 31 , jpk3 has got the smile , the jawline , the shoulders , " writes michelle cottle at the daily beast . " ( although , good lord , could that hair be any brighter orange ? ) " he 's also a decent orator , and has a harvard law degree and experience as an assistant da under his belt . this race , though , is about more than recharging the kennedy dynasty , writes cottle : it 's part of what could be a comeback year for democrats in massachusetts . they 're still smarting over losing a senate seat to scott brown , but elizabeth warren offers a chance to correct that . " this year offers a shot at redemption , if only dems can fire up their voters . and what better way to do so than with a kennedy on the ticket ? " maybe , but a skeptical peter gelzinis at the boston herald warns that plenty of " kennedy fatigue " still exists in the state .
