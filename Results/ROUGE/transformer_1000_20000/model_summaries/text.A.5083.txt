the nobel committee has made some strange choices over the years , but awarding its peace prize to the european union " may be the most bizarre decision in the history of the award , " writes dashiell bennett at the atlantic . so naturally , it 's got people talking . here 's what they 're saying . bennett thinks the decision makes sense in the long run . " however , as many people are pointing out , awarding the prize to the eu in 2012 seems odd , " given the economic and societal turmoil plaguing it . the award " is a classic example of an organization jumping the shark . quite how anyone could suggest this with a straight face i am not sure , " writes tim worstall , a self-proclaimed " extremist " against the eu , in forbes . he points out that it 's bizarre to praise an undemocratic organization for promoting democracy , and says the continent 's peace is more nato 's doing than the eu 's . " who did the nobel prize committee actually call to inform the european union it won ? " wonders bernd rigert at deutsche welle . still , he thinks the organization is a " worthy " winner . " the european union is a peace project , " he argues . " people who talk and trade with each other do not shoot each other . " " in the broad scheme of things , the eu has been a force for good and it seemed to be in need of a pep talk , " agrees matthew yglesias at slate . but there 's an elephant in the room : norway itself is n't part of the eu , and " they 've built an amazingly free and prosperous ( albeit small society for themselves . " rich and natural resources and with a responsive democracy , it wants no part of the bureaucracy it 's praising . for more reactions , see our original post on the award .
