humans were thought to be unique as a species in that we use both halves of our brains to " distinguish different aspects of sound , " as georgetown neuroscientist stuart washington puts it . turns out we 're not as special as we thought . a type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing , washington has discovered . in both humans and parnell 's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from mexico to brazil , redorbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds , while the right deals with slower ones , a press release reports . for humans , the right hemisphere " may allow us to identify who is speaking , to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice , and to tease out pitch in music , " washington notes . as for the left hemisphere , " men largely use just the left hemisphere " to process language , while women use both hemispheres to do so , washington says . in mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts , animal diversity web explains—the right hemisphere 's slower processing is used for sonar , " which relies on detecting small changes in frequency , " says washington , senior author of the study in frontiers in neuroscience . the left is used " to distinguish communication sounds from each other , because ( the bats ' ) communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency . " all this is more than just a matter of interest : the findings could help study human language disorders , especially since some study techniques " can only be permitted in animals , " washington adds . ( researchers are also learning more about how porpoises use sound—a lot like a flashlight . )
