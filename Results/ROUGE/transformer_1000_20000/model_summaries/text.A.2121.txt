fast food is n't making your kids fat—not really . what 's truly behind the trend of childhood obesity are the sodas , frozen pizzas , and cookies consumed at home , school , and whenever kids are n't in a mcdonald 's or burger king booth—a " western diet " high in saturated fats and added sugars , according to a new study . researchers looked at the eating habits of 4,466 american kids , aged 2 to 18 , and grouped them based on what they ate when they were n't eating fast food . what they found : those with the highest rates of being overweight or obese ate a western diet—even if they ate no fast food ; on the flip side , those who were high fast-food consumers but otherwise ate a " prudent " diet were much less likely to be overweight or obese , the los angeles times reports . the more often a child ate at fast food spots , however , the more likely he or she was to follow a similar diet at home . but " just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame , " one author says , per red orbit . in fact , health campaigns targeting fast-food restaurants may be " overestimated " in that they are " not sufficient to reduce child obesity if the remainder of the diet is not addressed .
