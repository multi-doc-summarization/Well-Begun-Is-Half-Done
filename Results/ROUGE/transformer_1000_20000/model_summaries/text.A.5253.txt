yesterday saw dennis rodman participate in a super weird cnn interview , and the bizarre saga of rodman in north korea did n't end there . the former nba player today sang " happy birthday " to " best friend " kim jong un , the ap reports . the performance , before an exhibition game involving us and north korean players , " started out as surreal , " a tour guide tells reuters . " then people joined in and it sort of faded a bit , but it seemed pretty heartfelt from rodman 's side . " as for kim , he " appeared to smile , but he did n't appear to expect it . " other players did n't accompany rodman in song , says former new york knick charles d. smith . " we always tell dennis that he ca n't sing . he is tone deaf , " smith notes . " he did it alone . "
