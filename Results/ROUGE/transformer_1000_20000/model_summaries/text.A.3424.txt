the big news from the consumer electronics show—where the expected theme is " the connected car " —is a plan to make your new vehicle a little more like your smartphone . general motors and audi tell the wall street journal they have plans to give their vehicles built-in 4g high-speed broadband , and the services sound pretty cool : gm says it 'll offer weather and music apps , viewable on an in-dash screen , plus a vehicle health app for troubleshooting problems with the car itself . but that 's only the beginning of what google calls the open automotive alliance : a teaming with automotive companies to bring google 's android system to the road , businessweek reports . honda and hyundai are also in on the deal , while nvidia will make the chips for automotive displays . but you 'll have to pay up for the services , expected later this year , and automakers are already being met with grumbling about distracted drivers . " to take mobile technology and give the driver distractions that do n't even relate to driving is just not the right direction , " a national safety council director said , adding , " i do n't blame the automakers , but they are now in an arms race to be more connected . " with those complaints in mind , automakers are working to integrate technology so as to be " glanceable . " as an nvidia rep says , " holding a phone and interacting with a phone while driving is just not safe . "
