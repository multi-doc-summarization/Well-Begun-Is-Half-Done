investigators suspect an overdose of prescription drugs caused prince 's death last week and they want to find out exactly where he got them , according to a source close to the investigation . the probe is looking at whether a doctor was on prince 's plane when he made an emergency landing in illinois the week before his death , and whether he overdosed on the plane , a law enforcement official tells the ap , which notes that the development is worryingly reminiscent of michael jackson 's death . the source confirmed reports that the opiate painkiller percocet is believed to have been involved . documents released on thursday signal that the investigation is now a criminal probe and charges are a possibility , the star tribune reports . the documents released by the carver county , minn. , sheriff 's office thursday include a request to seal the results of a search conducted at prince 's paisley park the day he died , reuters reports . a judge granted the request , which was made on the grounds that " intense media scrutiny " could hamper the investigation or risk injury to innocent people . carver county chief deputy jason kamerud declined to comment on reports of drugs found at prince 's home . he tells the ap that contrary to media reports , investigators have not asked the dea to get involved . " we might contact them to help us , but that has n't happened , " he says . " we do n't have the medical examiner 's report yet . we do n't know to what extent pharmaceuticals could be a part of this . " ( prince was given a private send-off last weekend . )
