tempted to blame china for your economic woes , america ? take a look in the mirror instead . that was the message of alibaba founder jack ma wednesday at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , where he wagged a finger at the us for blowing $ 14 trillion on war efforts over the past three decades while letting us infrastructure languish , cnbc reports . " it 's not that other countries steal jobs from you guys , " ma said , instead citing an error in us strategy , per the south china morning post ( which is owned by alibaba ) . while globalization has enriched us , the country ends up funneling money to wall street and silicon valley instead of to main street usa and people " not good at schooling , " he said , adding " not everybody can pass harvard like me . " he also asked where billions of dollars made by major multinational corporations like microsoft and ibm has gone , which investopedia sees as a reference to the cash they 've squirreled way abroad . ma 's comments come in the wake of campaign warnings from donald trump that the us could hit china with tariffs on its exports here , though ma says he 's met with trump sees him as " open minded and â€¦ listening , " per scmp . in other big alibaba news , an olympic-sized announcement : cnn reports the chinese e-commerce company has made a deal to supply technology and other services for the next six olympic games . ( here 's what else ma and trump talked about . )
