richard dunn recently found himself stuck , apparently all alone , overnight at las vegas ' mccarran airportâ€”so , naturally , he created an incredible music video of himself lip-syncing to celine dion 's cover of " all by myself " in various locations around the terminal . it even includes a shot of dunn re-creating the iconic waterfall scene from flashdance using a chair and a water bottle , upi notes . dunn explains , per gawker , that his tools were his iphone , a wheelchair with a tall pole on the back , a roll of luggage tape , his own computer bag , and the airport 's escalators and moving walkways . he taped the iphone to the pole or the extended handle of his computer bag , sometimes tucking " different stuff under the bag to get the right angle , " he says , and then placed it wherever he needed it to be , including the aforementioned escalators and walkways . " for the escalator shot i had to sprint up the steps after i got my shot so the computer bag did n't hit the top and fall back down , " he says . " quite fun ! "
