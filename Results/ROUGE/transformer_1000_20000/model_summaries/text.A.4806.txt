a photo album featuring candid shots of some of the most evil people ever to walk the earth has been snapped up for $ 41,000 by an anonymous buyer at an auction in england . the album , found in the bunker bedroom of eva braun , adolf hitler 's mistress , features hitler and henchmen including heinrich himmler and josef goebbels in lighter moments , the telegraph reports . some of the 73 photos can be seen on the auction site , including one of hitler relaxing in the alps . c & t auctioneers says the photo album was taken in april 1945 from the bunker as a souvenir by british wartime photographer edward " dixie " dean , who sold it to a collector in 1983 . per the auction house , " very few significant artifacts liberated from the fuhrer bunker in 1945 exist today in the open market , especially with such concrete provenance . " auction house owner matthew tredwen tells the new york times that it is clear that the photos were taken by a member of hitler 's inner circle , though the book gives no indication of who that might be . " the photographs had to be taken by someone who was very close , " he says . " all photographs of adolf hitler were very much controlled " to show him in the best light . these " would not have been made for the general public . " tredwen adds that in his years of dealing in nazi memorabilia and other military history items , he has never met anybody who actually supports nazi ideology . " people are fascinated by how evil the third reich were , " he says . ( there is a dispute over whether " hitler 's personal phone " is the real thing . )
