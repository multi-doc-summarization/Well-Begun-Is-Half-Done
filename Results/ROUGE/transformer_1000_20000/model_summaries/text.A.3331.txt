some 2.3 million earthlings who are not icelandic will trek through iceland this year , armed with selfie sticks in search of the island 's breathtaking fjords , waterfalls , volcanoes , and game of thrones backdrops . that 's nearly five times the foot traffic iceland saw seven years ago and it 's worth $ 3.4 billion and one out of every three jobs . but that boon for iceland 's economy comes with a serious drawback , writes laura mallonee at wired , as tourists trample over aforementioned natural beauty , infrastructures groan , and yes , sewers overflow . " uncontrolled tourism does have negative impacts on the environment , " a tourism professors says . " so if tourism is not planned and managed properly we will see some of the natural attractions be damaged . " " nice experience , " reads a typical trip advisor review , " but there should be less people . " it 's a problem that iceland has worked hard for : the iceland monitor points out that there 's now a guidebook in english that instructs tourists on how to act ( hint : do n't stick your hand in a geyser to see if it 's scalding ) , while nbc news notes that visit iceland put together the " iceland academy , " which gives visitors tips on gems like " how to avoid hot tub awkwardness . " add in cheap airfares , and the fact that , as a frommer 's rep puts it , " most travelers are jazzed by the idea of getting to see an additional destination on their way to europe , " and you 've got yourself a hot spot . mallonee cites one french photog who sought to document the tourist clog . the problem , she writes , " is that even as ( his work ) offers a commentary on all those damned tourists , his photos often look like tourism bureau ads . " ( whatever you do , do n't sneak your cat into iceland . )
