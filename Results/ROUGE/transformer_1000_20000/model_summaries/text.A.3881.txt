john stumpf , the wells fargo ceo slammed for his " gutless leadership " by sen. elizabeth warren last week , is going to have to tighten his belt a little this year : he will forfeit his bonus , part of his salary , and $ 41 million in stock awards over the fake-account scandal that saw the sacking of 5,300 employees , cnn reports . in addition , stumpf will work for free while the company conducts an investigation . the bank 's board of directors also says carrie tolstedt , who headed the retail division where workers created the phony accounts , will forfeit at least $ 19 million of the $ 125 million she was going to leave the company with at the end of the year , and will not receive severance or a bonus for 2016 . the announcement comes as wells fargo is set to go before the house financial services committee on thursday . the board says it is launching an independent investigation into how millions of accounts were created without the permission of customers , the bbc reports . wells fargo was fined $ 185 million over the scandal and the washington post describes the board 's cash clawback as " by far the most aggressive and public effort " since the 2008 financial crisis to punish bank chiefs for misconductâ€”although stumpf still has the estimated $ 161 million he received in bonuses over the five years the scam took place , and tolstedt received $ 60 million over the same period . ( wells fargo whistleblowers say they were fired for speaking out . )
