the man who co-founded pixar and is seen as the creative force behind blockbusters such as the toy story and cars franchises will soon be out of a job at disney . john lasseter , 61 , has been on leave from parent company disney since november after allegations of improper workplace behavior surfaced , including his propensity to wrap up everyone he meets in long bear hugs . disney announced friday that lasseter—who previously acknowledged and apologized for his " missteps " —will shift into a vague consulting role through the end of the year and then depart for good , reports the new york times . disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow lasseter to return , but deadline reports on a " gathering sense " among employees that he would not have been welcome . disney chief bob iger issued a statement that praised lasseter for " reinventing the animation business , taking breathtaking risks , and telling original , high quality stories that will last forever , ” and lasseter issued one of his own thanking disney and saying he 's " extremely proud " of his work but that it 's time to move on . despite the positive public comments , the move amounts to what the los angeles times describes as " a dramatic unraveling of one of the most storied careers in animation . " the story notes that hugs were just a part of the problem , with female employees at pixar alleging that lasseter and other senior execs turned a blind eye to a corporate culture rife with crude jokes and inappropriate touching . ( actress and screenwriter rashida jones left toy story 4 and complained about pixar 's unequal treatment of women . )
