republicans were today again busily piling on president obama 's strategy—or lack thereof—against islamic state militants , but this week they were joined by a pretty prominent democrat : dianne feinstein . " i ’ ve learned one thing about this president , and that is he ’ s very cautious , " said the senate intel committee chair , adding that , " maybe , in this instance , too cautious . " feinstein said she agreed with john mccain and lindsey graham 's op-ed this weekend calling for military action , reports politico , adding that she hopes the pentagon and state department can " coalesce " their planning into a single strategy to take on isis . elsewhere on your sunday dial : mike rogers : " this is an opportunity for the president to bring the country together so that we understand this ‘ don ’ t-do-stupid-stuff ’ policy isn ’ t working . if you have your own european allies saying , ‘ maybe the united states isn ’ t a leader on this issue , ’ that ’ s a problem for us . " john mccain : the arizonan wants " additional us troops " to fight isis , and says obama is " either in denial or overwhelmed . this is a direct threat to the united states of america . it may be one of the biggest we ’ ve ever faced . " dutch ruppersberger : referencing the white house 's lack of isis strategy , the maryland democrat said , " it ’ s extremely urgent , but you just don ’ t rush in because the media ’ s talking about it . we will do what we have to do to protect us from isis .
