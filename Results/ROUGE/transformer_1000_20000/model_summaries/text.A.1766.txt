influential white house staff secretary rob porter resigned wednesday in the wake of reports he physically abused two ex-wives , reports that he maintains are " vile " and " simply false . " the claims come via colbie holderness ( who married porter in 2003 ) and jennifer willoughby ( who married him in 2009 ) . the washington post reports white house staffers knew vaguely of the situation as of late 2017 , but only heard the alleged details when contacted tuesday by a reporter from the daily mail , which first reported the women 's story . but holderness and willoughby say they did tell the fbi what happened in january 2017 . " i thought by sharing my story with the fbi he wouldn â€™ t be put in that post , " holderness says , explaining that she voiced concerns he could be blackmailed because of the number of people who knew about her situation .
