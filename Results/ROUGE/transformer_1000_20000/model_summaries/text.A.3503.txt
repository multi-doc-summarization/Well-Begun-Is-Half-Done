whoa . medical faculty at the university of alberta in canada booked a reiki expert to lead a spoon-bending workshop—and no , this is not a joke . “ this experiential workshop will teach a guided meditation/energy transfer technique which will have most participants bending cutlery using the power of their minds , " says a poster for the workshop , " spoon bending and the power of the mind , " per the cbc . the poster boasts that " typically 75 % or more " of workshop attendees will be able to bend spoons with nothing but their brain . the spoons were to be provided . “ just let that sink in , " writes one skeptic at science blogs . " whoever runs the pediatric integrative medicine rounds thought that it was a good idea to invite an 'energy healer ' to demonstrate how to use the 'power of the mind ' to bend a spoon ! ” unfortunately for aspiring spoon-benders , the workshop was canceled after a law professor at the university of alberta tweeted a photo of the poster , bringing countless accusations of promoting " medical quackery " against the university . “ bending spoons is a great entry level activity . sadly my med school taught science , " tweeted a new england pediatrician . “ solid skills for every physician to possess . yikes , " added a canadian researcher and city councillor .
