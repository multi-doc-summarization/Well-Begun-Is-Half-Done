" it 's just a systematic public health failure . it 's shocking that this has come roaring back in the united states , " david harvey of the national coalition of std directors tells the guardian . syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics , and women can be treated while they are pregnant to prevent the disease from being passed on to their child . but , per the guardian , some women do not get tested , and others contract the disease while pregnant after testing negative . in some cases , there is a connection to drug use . overall , there were 30,644 syphilis diagnoses in the us in 2017â€”up 76 % from the year before .
