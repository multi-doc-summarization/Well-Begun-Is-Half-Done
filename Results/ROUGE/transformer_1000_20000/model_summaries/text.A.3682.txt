frances bean cobain made her musical debut yesterday—albeit in cameo form—with the release of evelyn evelyn . “ she ’ s got a great voice , ” says amanda palmer , who put together the concept album with jason webley . the 17-year-old is featured on the track “ my space ” along with other “ really random people , ” palmer says , including weird al yankovic , tegan and sara , and gerard way of my chemical romance , people reports . the album has “ personality to spare , ” writes laura studarus on under the radar , but as for cobain , the proliferation of cameos on “ my space ” means “ it 's impossible to pick out individual voices. ” a blogger on the ruckus calls the track a “ power ballad ” and says the album as a whole is “ eccentric. ” so will cobain be following in her parents ’ footsteps ? palmer isn ’ t so sure : “ she 's a really good visual artist . she 's really interested in graphic novels . ”
