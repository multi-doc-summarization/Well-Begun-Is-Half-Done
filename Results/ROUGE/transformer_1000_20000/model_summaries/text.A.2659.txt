is donald trump running for president simply as a means of launching his own cable news network ? that 's the theory put forth by vanity fair , quoting anonymous sources close to the situation . trump is reportedly " irked " that he 's bringing in big ratings for other networks without getting any of the profits himself . “ he wants to figure out if he can monetize it , ” a source says . he 's allegedly consulting with daughter ivanka trump and son-in-law jared kushner on a " mini-media conglomerate . " his reasoning , according to a source : “ we ’ ve triggered a base of the population that hasn ’ t had a voice in a long time. ” a trump spokesperson denies trump is even thinking about such a thing . but immediately after , trump tweeted : " the press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people ! ” new york magazine says the theory makes sense . this is the first time it 's unclear whether a presidential candidate actually wants to be president . trump is historically unpopular and shows little interest in changing that , and he 's half-assing basic tasks of running for president , such as calling donors . trump tv would be the " logical end " of his campaign , according to new republic . “ if trump ’ s tv station gets 30 % ratings , it ’ ll be doing fantastically well , " the website states . " but if that ’ s his share of the vote , then his candidacy will end in failure. ” transitioning from presidential candidate to media baron would n't be easy . trump would still need a partner for funding and would likely need to buy an existing cable channel . “ it ’ s a fool ’ s errand , ” an entertainment executive tells vanity fair . “ but then again , we are talking about donald trump. ” ( did this 1992 movie predict trump 's campaign ? )
