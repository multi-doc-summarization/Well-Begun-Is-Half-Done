toronto 's crack-smoking mayor has made it clear he 's not going anywhere despite his many scandals , but city council has other ideas . councilors will today consider a motion that would call on rob ford to apologize , take a leave of absence , and cooperate with a police investigation into his activities , cbc reports . just one problem : even if it passes ( ford , who made the motion the key item at today 's council meeting , has promised a " rumble in the jungle " debate ) , ford wo n't actually have to heed the request . if he refuses , the city council can ask ontario to pass legislation removing him , but the council itself ca n't remove him from office since he has n't been convicted of a crimeâ€”and councilors are hesitant to ask ontario to step in . with " no clear legal path to force him out , " the ap reports , the council is looking for a way to isolate ford and run the city without him , which could actually be possible , since the powers of the toronto mayor are more limited than the powers of many mayors in big us cities . " we really just have to build a box around the mayor so we can get work done , " says one councilor . a second option to be debated next month : a motion that would further limit ford 's powers , basically keeping him from being able to fire executive committee members who want him out . " we will shun him , curtail his power as best we can , " says another councilor . " he clearly has gone off the deep end , shot himself in outer space . " much of the public , though , still loves ford : hundreds lined up to buy " robbie bobbie " bobblehead dolls yesterday ; they 're being sold for charity .
