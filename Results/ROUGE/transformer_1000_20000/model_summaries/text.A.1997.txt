in what some conservative commentators are calling a major snub , president obama will not be attending antonin scalia 's funeral on saturday . instead , joe biden will attend the service at washington dc 's basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception , nbc reports . " the president will pay his respects at the supreme court on friday and he 'll be joined with the first lady when he does that , " white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters . earnest did n't take the bait when he was asked whether obama plans to go golfing on saturday , but said the president " believes it 's important for the institution of the presidency to pay his respects to somebody who dedicated three decades of his life to the institution of the supreme court . " the decision surprised some obama allies , who said skipping the funeral will do nothing to reduce partisanship , reports politico , which notes that obama has praised scalia as one of the " most consequential judges and thinkers to serve . " some of those close to the scalia family do n't have a problem with obama being a no-show . " i would n't have expected president obama to attend the funeral mass , and i see no reason to fault him for not attending , " former scalia clerk ed whelan says . " the ceremony at the supreme court seems the most apt opportunity for the president to pay his respects , but he obviously might have severe competing demands on his time . " ( obama says he plans to nominate an " indisputably qualified " candidate to replace scalia on the court . )
