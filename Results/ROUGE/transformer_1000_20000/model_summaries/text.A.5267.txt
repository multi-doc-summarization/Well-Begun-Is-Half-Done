lee so yeon volunteered to join the north korea army in 1992 , lured in part , she says , by the promise of a daily meal . while cautioning that stories of defectors like lee have to be taken with a grain of salt , the bbc presents an interview with the now 41-year-old about a military experience that she describes as brutal on the body . lee says she was 17 when she enlisted , and she was initially energized by the experience . that quickly gave way . " after six months to a year of service , we would n't menstruate anymore because of malnutrition and the stressful environment , " she says . the training was tough—essentially equivalent to what the men underwent , just slightly shorter—and they had to do domestic chores that the men did n't . conditions were far from comfortable , she says : the women slept on mattresses made of rice hull that soaked up their body odor as they slept and sweated , making for an unpleasant smell . showers were icy cold and compliments of a hose that pulled water from a mountain stream : " we would get frogs and snakes through the hose . " she says rape was common ( a statement she gave more detail about in this 2016 interview with the korea herald ) , though it 's not something she experienced , and that access to sanitary pads for those who needed them was extremely limited . lee got out in 2001 and successfully fled to south korea about eight years later . the bbc notes that military service became compulsory for women in 2015 ; they must now serve from ages 18 to 25 . ( the most recent defector has regained consciousness in the hospital . )
