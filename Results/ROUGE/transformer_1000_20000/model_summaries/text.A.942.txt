if hillary clinton 's going to win over new yorkers before the state 's april 19 primary , first she 's got to prove she can master the nyc subway system . and she had a little trouble thursday in the bronx when , just like nearly every other big apple commuter has experienced , she tried to swipe her metrocard to get through a turnstile and failed not once , but four times , reports buzzfeed . the site has an animated gif display of clinton 's persistence in all of her in-vain attempts , finally making it through on the fifth swipe . but as politico points out , bernie sanders does n't exactly have this in the bag , either . when he sat down with the new york daily news on friday , his interrogators asked him if he knew how to ride the subway . the brooklyn native seemed confused as to what the reporter meant at first , then replied , " you get a token and you get in . " ( tokens were discontinued in 2003 . ) when he was told he was wrong , he recovered with : " you jump over the turnstile . " ( too bad hillary was n't on the subway when improv everywhere pulled off its latest prank . )
