perhaps aliens have taken a liking to the great white north . the annual canadian ufo survey by winnipeg-based ufology research shows " the second highest level of sightings that we 've recorded since we started doing the survey back in the 1980s , " with 1,267 across canada in 2015 , rep chris rutkowski tells the cbc . only 2012 had more , with 1,981 sightings . the provinces of alberta , saskatchewan , manitoba , nova scotia , and newfoundland each saw an increase in reports over 2014 , but quebec outpaced them all , according to data from 17 sources , including transport canada and youtube . the province , which typically produces 5 % to 15 % of all ufo reports in canada , generated 35 % of reports in 2015 , reports the canadian press . montreal led canadian cities with 97 reports , followed by 78 in toronto , and 69 in vancouver . that does n't mean there were that many unexplained cases ; about 88 % of unidentifiable objects turn out to be stars , planets , airplanes , or helicopters , rutkowski says . ufology research investigates the remaining cases—by visiting a site and talking to witnesses—to determine if a case is " high quality . " about 1 % to 3 % of cases fall into this group , rutkowski says . one of the perhaps not-so-high-quality ones : a resident in sainte-brigitte de laval , quebec , recalled seeing three 4-feet-tall " humanoids " with huge heads and " big , black slanted eyes , " and hearing a high-pitched hum . " we 're not saying the little grey guys are here , " rutkowski tells ctv news . " this is simply what people are reporting . " ( aliens might also have a thing for florida . )
