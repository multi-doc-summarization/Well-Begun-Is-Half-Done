the mysteries of old faithful may soon be solved , thanks , in part , to something that looks like a giant hula hoop . american and danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth , " visualizing " the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface , says carol finn . she 's waited a decade to explore what she calls " a last frontier ... in yellowstone , " and the intention is to better map the flow of water that 's feeding old faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions . over a four-week period , a helicopter will fly above , armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop . the ap explains it in layman 's terms : " the device acts like an x-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface . " scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth , " rotten " sulfuric rock , or water lurks below , which could assist in identifying unstable areas , per wyoming public media . but a press release frames the main quest like so : we know that the water that explodes from yellowstone 's geysers " originates as old precipitation , snow and rain that percolates down into the crust , is heated , and ultimately returns to the surface . " we know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course . what scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take . " does it travel down and back up ? does it travel laterally ? " asks finn . right now , " nobody knows . " ( archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a mayan temple . )
