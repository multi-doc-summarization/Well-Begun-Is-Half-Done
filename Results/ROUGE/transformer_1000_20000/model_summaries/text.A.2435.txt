amy schumer has been hit with backlash since the announcement that she 'll be playing barbie in an upcoming movie about the iconic toy , and on tuesday , she hit back at the haters on instagram . next to a picture of herself in a bathing suit , she wrote that it should n't really be called " fat shaming " because she knows she 's not fat and has " zero shame . " " when i look in the mirror i know who i am , " she continues . " [ i 'm ] a great friend , sister , daughter and girlfriend . i 'm a badass comic headlining arenas all over the world and making tv and movies and writing books . " she ends by thanking the trolls , because they actually made it " so evident that i am a great choice " for the role of barbie : " it 's that kind of response that [ lets ] you know something 's wrong with our culture and we all need to work together to change it . " there 's quite a bit of support for her out there : as the guardian points out , were the producers to attempt to cast someone with the barbie toy 's actual dimensions , that person " would be unable to lift her head or stand . " and , as the washington post pointed out before schumer 's instagram post , the comedian is self-confident , hilarious , smart , successful , and self-madeâ€” " who better to recalibrate the image and message of barbie ? "
