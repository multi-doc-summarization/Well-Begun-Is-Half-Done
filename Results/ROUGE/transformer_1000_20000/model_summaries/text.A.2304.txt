caitlan coleman hailed from stewartstown , pa. , a " land where bad things are n't supposed to happen . " and yet a gripping philadelphia magazine story describes how something bad did happen to the 26-year-old and her husband—canadian activist joshua boyle , once married to the sister of gitmo prisoner omar khadr—in 2012 : they were kidnapped by the taliban in afghanistan during a hike across central asia . the story by holly otterbein ( an acquaintance of coleman 's from the same town ) documents the disbelief the pair 's loved ones felt when they first heard they were missing , the horror when they heard in 2013 the taliban was holding them captive , and the panic when a series of proof-of-life videos of the two emerged , the third one in august . " we never think that someone we love will end up in a video released by the taliban , " otterbein writes . but the american public at large is " grotesquely indifferent " to the fate of the couple and their two kids , since born in captivity . officials believe the couple were taken hostage near kabul by a taliban affiliate known as the " sopranos of the afghanistan war " and are now being held in pakistan . they 've been in captivity for four years—just one year shy of the five years us army sgt . bowe bergdahl was held captive . the taliban told the ap this summer the family was in good health , but in the august video , coleman and boyle said they and their kids would be executed unless kabul officials stop killing taliban prisoners . otterbein notes their story has barely made a blip with the media , the us government has remained mostly tight-lipped , and online commentary about the disappeared pair can be cruel : " if we get them back , they would probably travel to syria for their next little getaway , " one poster noted . " caitlan , like the war in afghanistan and the fight against the taliban , has been forgotten , " otterbein writes . ( the chilling philadelphia magazine story is worth the full read . )
