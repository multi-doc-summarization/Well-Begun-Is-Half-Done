one way to get the head of apple to visit the microsoft campus : tell him it 's picture day with the president of china . tim cook and other technology bigwigs—including facebook 's mark zuckerberg , amazon 's jeff bezos , and alibaba 's jack ma—gathered yesterday in redmond , wash. , for a meeting with xi jinping , who 's in the us on his first state visit , reports quartz . while they were there , xi and the group of 29 high-level us and chinese tech execs posed for what the site calls " an awkward class photo of super powerful people " that showed , more or less , what it would look like if " the tech world had an all-star game , " as geekwire puts it . after touring microsoft 's executive building with bill gates and ceo satya nadella and watching high-tech demos , xi smiled for the camera with the others . zuckerberg ( who quartz points out does , indeed , own a suit ) greeted xi by speaking to him briefly in mandarin , the south china morning post reports . " on a personal note , this was the first time i 've ever spoken with a world leader entirely in a foreign language , " zuckerberg wrote in a facebook post . " i consider that a meaningful personal milestone . it was an honor to meet president xi and other leaders . " one of those leaders was lu wei , the chinese internet chief responsible for setting up the country 's firewall and keeping zuckerberg 's site out—a point not lost on commenters to zuckerberg 's post . " he banned facebook in china . he does n't deserve to meet u man , " wrote one .
