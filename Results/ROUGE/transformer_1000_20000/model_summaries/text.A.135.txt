surf tragedy in britain : three people died after being caught in a rip current off a beach in cornwall yesterday . police say a man and woman in their 40s and a man in his 50s died after they were pulled unconscious from the water and airlifted to the hospital , reports the bbc . four children in the same group were saved . an emergency services worker describes conditions at the popular mawgan porth as " dangerous " and says one of the casualties entered the water to assist others who were struggling . the owner of a nearby surf school tells the guardian that while the currents may have been slightly more dangerous than usual , he has seen far worse conditions . " the waves were bigger , they were quite big . and it was n't the safest of days to be in the sea , " he says . " but it was n't particularly dangerous . there were lots of safe places to be and they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time . " ( in california earlier this month , surfers were in the right place at the right time to rescue a couple whose romantic hot-air-balloon ride had gone awry . )
