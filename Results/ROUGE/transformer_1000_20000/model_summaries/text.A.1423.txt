relax , girls . not a hair on justin bieber 's head is out of place , even though a honda civic collided with the black ferrari he was driving in los angeles yesterday . neither driver was injured and bieb 's assistant , who was a passenger in his car , was similarly unharmed ; no damage was reported , according to access hollywood . maybe he did n't get out of the way fast enough because he was dreaming about winning the award for best male video at the mtv video music awardsâ€”and punking pal taylor swift while filming the first new episode of punk 'd last week .
