the hostility toward women gamers that was laid bare in 2014 during the gamergate controversy extends to the stereotype that female gamers are inferior to their male counterparts . so researchers at the university of california , davis , decided to track thousands of players in two multiplayer online role-playing games and compare just how quickly the players advanced to higher levels . and as cuihua “ cindy ” shen , an assistant professor of communication , reports in the journal of computer-mediated communication , when controlling for factors such as time devoted to playing , character choice , and membership in a player 's guild , " the gender differences disappear . " in fact , she goes on to write for the conversation , " women advanced at least as fast as men did . " shen says the findings confirm certain differences in style of play , such as that men tend to focus on competing and gaining in-game status while women tend to play more socially and help others . but in terms of the bottom line : advancing to a higher level , the difference was nil among the 11,000 gamers they analyzed playing everquest ii and chevalier 's romance iii . aside from one study in 2009 , vocativ reports that this is the first to figure out how to go about testing gender differences in gaming performance outside of a lab . why does it matter ? nearly half the gaming population is now female , yet they are represented at even lower numbers in stem fields of science , technology , engineering , and math . " the stereotype that women are worse players at games could contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy , " shen says . ( guys who are hostile to girl gamers tend to be poor performers . )
