a month after confirming zika causes birth defects , cdc researchers say there is a " substantial " risk that a pregnant woman will have a baby with a birth defect if infected with zika during her first trimester . more specifically , the risk for microencaphaly is 1 % to 14 % depending on the scenario , reports the ap . the range is wide given that research into the disease is relatively new . for the study , scientists analyzed data from 400 babies diagnosed with microcephaly—in which babies are born with abnormally small heads—in the brazilian state of bahia between july and february . because the study focused exclusively on microcephaly in a single brazilian state , " these numbers are probably only the tip of the iceberg , " says a ucla professor . one notable quirk : the bigger the outbreak , the better the odds are of having a healthy baby—because more women would be exposed before becoming pregnant and perhaps develop immunity . when the outbreak is small , the risk rises to the 14 % level . an earlier study out of brazil put the risk of zika-related birth defects and fetal death at almost 30 % , though one based on a zika outbreak in french polynesia put the risk of microcephaly at 1 % . but even a 1 % risk could be devastating in developing countries , where there are limited care options for disabled children , a health expert tells usa today . a separate study published wednesday notes three brazilian infants with microcephaly showed eye problems not linked to zika before , including retinal lesions , hemorrhaging , and abnormal blood vessel development , per a release . ( the number of pregnant women with zika in the us has nearly tripled . )
