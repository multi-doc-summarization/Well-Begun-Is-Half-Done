elton john 's feud with madonna continues , with john declaring last night that the material girl 's " career is over . " as evidence , he pointed out that " her tour has been a disaster , " adding , " it could n't happen to a bigger **** . " appearing on australian show sunday night , john also had harsh words for madonna 's look , comparing her to " a f***ing fairground stripper . " why so angry ? john may have provided a clue ; he accused madonna of being " so horrible " to lady gaga , who just so happens to be godmother to john 's son , the daily mail notes . " she 's such a nightmare , " he said . " if madonna had any common sense she would have made a record like ray of light and stayed away from the dance stuff and just been a great pop singer and make great pop records , which she does brilliantly . "
