well , now we know what a portion of those new , higher netflix fees could be used for : to pay call center reps to deal with angry customers . customer service reps have been telling callers that the company not only told them to be ready for a backlash , it hired extra employees to take the calls , cnet reports . “ we tested , we researched , we analyzed . we knew what the reaction was going to be , ” a spokesman confirmed . “ we are not surprised. ” despite the extra manpower , the phone lines have been overwhelmed . one analyst found that it took representatives nine to 15 minutes to get to the many callers on hold . when they did pick up , their suggestion was to just cancel in september , when the price increase hits . “ there was simply no promo or 'save ' technique to … retain our business , ” he complained , indicating that “ netflix is simply not concerned with the prospect of losing customers. ” but hey , it ’ s not all bad news , netflix users : the company has renewed its deal with nbc universal , so at least you can stream new episodes of 30 rock .
