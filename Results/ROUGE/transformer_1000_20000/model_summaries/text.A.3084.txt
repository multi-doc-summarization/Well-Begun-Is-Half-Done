the man accused of killing four people with a hijacked beer truck in stockholm friday is a 39-year-old from uzbekistan who was a " marginal character " already known to authorities , officials in sweden say . police say they found a " suspect device " in the vehicle and they have n't ruled out the involvement of other people , the bbc reports . ten people , including a child , are still in hospital after the attack on one of the city 's main thoroughfares . authorities believe the device may have burned the suspect instead of exploding when he drove through crowds on a pedestrianized street and crashed into a department store , the guardian reports . police say the suspect fled after the attack and was arrested in a northern suburb . the ap reports that sweden 's prime minister stefan lofven made a point of walking through the city 's streets and stopping to chat to people before laying flowers at the scene saturday. " we must get through this . life must go on , " lofven said . " we in sweden want an open society . " " terrorists want us to be afraid , want us to change our behaviour , want us to not live our lives normally , but that is what we 're going to do , " lofven said . " so terrorists can never defeat sweden , never . " there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack , though isis claimed similar attacks in cities including london and nice , reports reuters .
