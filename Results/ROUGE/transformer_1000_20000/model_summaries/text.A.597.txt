when adam seger was brought on as head of restaurant operations at the storied seelbach hotel ( now the seelbach hilton ) in downtown louisville , ky. , he announced that he 'd stumbled upon the recipe of a pre-prohibition drink that used to be the hotel 's signature drink and that he tried it , he enjoyed it , and he was putting in back on the menu . but as the new york times reports , the " rescued classic " that gained fast notoriety and established seger as a brand name was in fact seger 's own creation , a " ruse " as the louisville courier-journal calls it . now seger , who " carried this around " for 21 years , has decided to finally come clean . " i was nobody , " says seger , who left the hotel in 2001 , is now 47 , and recently helped open the tuck room in manhattan . " i knew i could make a great drink . i wanted it to be this promotion for the hotel , and i felt the hotel needed a signature cocktail . how could you have a place that f. scott fitzgerald hung out in that doesn â€™ t have a damn cocktail ? " everyone bought the story ( even the historian known as dr . cocktail who wrote a book about vintage spirits ) and loved the drink , which is made with bourbon , triple sec , bitters , sparkling wine , and garnished with an orange twist . even the hotel is sticking with the drink as its signature cocktail , saying it 's become a hotel tradition and " will remain part of its future . " ( this is obama 's cocktail of choice . )
