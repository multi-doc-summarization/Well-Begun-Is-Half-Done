hatchimals , the hottest toys of the holiday season , laid an egg with many expectant kids christmas morning when their furry hatchlings refused to come out of their shells . now the manufacturer , spin master , is facing a class-action lawsuit from a california mom who alleges her child 's egg was a dud . the lawsuit , filed by jodie hejduk of bakersfield , calif. , on behalf of what the suit says could be millions of consumers , claims spin master ran " a bait-and-switch marketing scheme . " hatchimals are plush animals stuffed into plastic eggs that , when the egg is rubbed and cuddled for about half an hour , should begin to peck their way out . while spin master acknowledges some of the toys did n't work as intended , the company tells cnbc it " provided troubleshooting support and where required immediately made available replacement products . " the toy cost about $ 50 in stores , but it was so popular it spawned internet bidding up to $ 350â€”only to leave many buyers disappointed . one customer wrote on amazon.com that she " watched every youtube video we could for help , but to no avail , " the lawsuit says , per nbc news . others complained that calling spin master had done no good because the company was " impossible to contact , " or that when they got through they were told to open the egg themselves . spin master blames the toy 's popularity , saying the company " experienced a higher than anticipated number of calls " over the holidays , and that the lawsuit 's allegations are " not based on actual facts . " but an attorney on the case tells courthouse news that the toy 's failure rate is " exceptionally high , " and that the company knew the product was n't ready for market . hejduk 's lawyer , mark geragos , tells abc news his client was never offered a refund for her defective hatchimal .
