british hospitals have incinerated more than 15,500 aborted and miscarried fetal remains over the years , at times to generate power for heat in " waste-to-energy " plants , the telegraph reports . a uk television show revealed the practice tonight , but health officials beat them to the punch by banning the practice yesterday . in all , ten hospitals have admitted to incinerating fetal remains with other garbage , while two leading hospitals—addenbrooke ’ s in cambridge and ipswich hospital—said they burned about 1,900 of them at energy facilities . until now , british law has required hospital staff to offer women who have a miscarriage or abortion three options : incineration , cremation , or burial , the bbc reports . but forms given to women mention " cremated " and make no mention of " incineration " with the daily trash , reports the daily mail . at times , hospital staff actually told the real story : " i was hysterical . i was crying , " said a 35-year-old woman who learned at a 13-week scan that her baby had died at 8 weeks . " i asked one of the nurses what would happen to my baby , and she just said , 'well , it will be incinerated with the rest of the day 's waste . ' "
