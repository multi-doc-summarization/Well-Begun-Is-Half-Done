mr. reggie ’ s lawn cutting service is booming—and it 's all because of a viral video made after the cops were called on the company 's namesake . that would be 12-year-old reginald fields , who wews explains runs a summer landscaping business in maple heights , ohio , that cuts people 's lawns and cleans up their yards , tapping into his siblings and cousins for help . some trouble arose recently , however , when fields was mowing the lawn of lucille holt and mistakenly ended up on a portion of holt 's neighbor 's lawn where the two yards overlap . instead of informing reggie of the mistake , the neighbor instead called the cops , lt. joe mocsiran from the maple heights police department confirmed to fox news . holt was outraged , and posted a video on facebook showing the kids working hard in her yard , as well as the parked police car . she called the whole situation " ridiculous . " " who does that ? " she says in the clip , before turning to one of the four children and telling him , " i 'm so glad you 're out here doing something positive . " mocsiran tells fox no action was taken against the kids , and reggie says the police never even talked to him or the other children . " [ the neighbor ] said i was cutting their grass , " he tells wews . " i did n't know it . " a silver lining in this story : once holt 's video spread , reggie—who holt says started the business to raise extra money to help his mom , who cares for his disabled grandfather , per the hill—started getting flooded with requests from other locals to tend to their lawns . reggie says he 'll invest whatever money he rakes in to buy more equipment for his business . " just give me a call . i will be there . on time , " he tells wews .
