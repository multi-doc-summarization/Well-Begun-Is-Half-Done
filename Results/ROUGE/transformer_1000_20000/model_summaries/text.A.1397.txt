jeff sessions may not be the only cabinet member whose days are numbered . multiple reports say secretary of state rex tillerson is n't destined for a long tenure . the latest is reuters , whose source says tillerson was " very upset at not having autonomy , independence and control over his own department and the ability to do the job the way the job ... is traditionally done . " it says tillerson has told friends he likely wo n't last a full year , a sentiment echoed in an earlier cnn story . that one quotes two insiders who say a " rexit " is possible before the end of the year , adding that tillerson has been especially unhappy with president trump 's public criticism of attorney general sessions . the story adds , however , that tillerson might just have been " venting . " tillerson had previously signaled that he intended to see through a restructuring of the state department through 2017 , but that now seems to be in doubt , reports newsweek . it runs through his past frictions with the white house , including not being consulted on major issues such as the travel ban . the speculation has been circulating for weeks now , notes us news & world report , and it is n't helped by statements from tillerson himself , who said in march that he " did n't want this job . " it 's reached the point where tillerson 's spokesman addressed the subject , though in the form of a denial that his boss is on the way out . tillerson , he said , had " plenty of reasons to stay on the job , and all of them are important to america .
