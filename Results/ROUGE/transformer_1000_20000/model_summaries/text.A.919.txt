" he seemed conflicted , contained , his face was tense . i could see redness in his eyes . it was obvious that without freedom to express himself he was not behaving naturally even with me , " says lu , who adds that ai otherwise appeared to be in good health . " we could not talk about the economic charges or other stuff , " she says , and tells the ap that others were present when they met , and some of them were taking notes . " we were careful , we knew that the deal could be broken at any moment , so we were careful . " lu says ai was not handcuffed and was wearing his own clothes instead of a detention center uniform . his trademark beard had not been shaven . chinese authorities have not specified the charges against him , except to say he was being investigated for " economic crimes , " but it is generally believed ai is actually being investigated for his criticism of the government .
