two balloonists who took off from japan early on sunday have sailed past the world distance record and are still in the sky . american troy bradley and russian leonid tiukhtyaev— the " two eagles " —passed the old record of 5,261 miles yesterday and are due to pass the balloon duration record of 137 hours aloft , set during the first trans-atlantic balloon flight in 1978 , some time today , reports the bbc . " we 're not taking any time to celebrate , " the head of mission control says . " we have a lot of work we have to do , and we 're just taking this flight one hour at a time . " a worker at mission control , which is based in a balloon museum in albuquerque , tells reuters that the balloonists are doing fine despite cramped conditions in the capsule , where they are equipped with cold-weather gear and are living on freeze-dried hikers ' meals . the men had originally planned to land in canada , but they changed course because of weather conditions and are due to land in baja california , mexico , on saturday . chase crews are being organized to help the landing , which mission control says will probably be among sand dunes on the peninsula , the ap reports .
