madonna 's 15-year-old son has been ordered by a judge to return to his famous mom in new york , though it 's not clear whether rocco ritchie—who , his lawyers have said , would much rather stay with dad guy ritchie—has actually complied with said order . sources have been saying rocco had no plans to return to his mom ; he 's not pictured in any of the christmas day snaps of her kids that madonna shared on instagram ( though she did also share an older picture of rocco with the caption , " merry x-mas to the sun-shine of my life ! " ) ; and page six reports that he spent the holiday with his dad and told a friend , via instagram , that he was staying in london . so what 's the problem ? as tmz reports , it sounds like pretty typical teenage stuff . sources say rocco is " miserable " having to be on tour with his mom , and that many " horrible , full-blown fights with screaming and crying " have taken place . radar also reports the teen was fed up with how " controlling " his mom is . rocco has also reportedly said that his mom treats him like a trophy , not a son . and page six notes that madonna 's oversharing may be part of the problem : among other things , she 's posted things like a picture of rocco in pigtails and a snap of him in a bathing suit with the hashtag , " # nosausage . " of course , there are also the sources telling tmz that , per madonna , this is all guy ritchie 's fault and that he 's trying to come between mother and son by trash-talking madonna to rocco .
