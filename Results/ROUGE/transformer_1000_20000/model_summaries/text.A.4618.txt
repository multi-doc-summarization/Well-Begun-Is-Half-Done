a sunday deadline is looming for iran to strike a nuclear deal with six world powers under a plan set in motion last yearâ€”but with just days to go , iran 's supreme leader has made the chances of a deal being forged in time look supremely unlikely . in a major speech , ayatollah ali khamenei said the country will need 190,000 centrifuge machines , 19 times as many as the 10,000 negotiators from the us , france , britain , russia , china , and germany want to limit the country to in order to reduce its capacity to build nuclear weapons . after the leader 's speech appeared to undermine negotiators , analysts began to wonder whether iran really wants a deal that would limit its nuclear capacity in return for the lifting of sanctions , or if khamenei is playing for time , the atlantic notes . " in ostensibly expressing support for the iranian negotiating team , close scrutiny of khamenei 's speech shows that in reality his remarks were aimed at severely curtailing his team 's room for maneuver , making it effectively impossible to bridge gaps with the stance " of the six powers , an intelligence analysis seen by reuters states . if all sides agree , the talks could be extended for another six months , though us officials say they will need to see some progress in the days to come before they will agree to an extension . john kerry joined the talks in vienna yesterday , but it 's not clear whether he made any progress during hours of talks with iran 's foreign minister ; issues including afghanistan were also discussed , the ap reports .
