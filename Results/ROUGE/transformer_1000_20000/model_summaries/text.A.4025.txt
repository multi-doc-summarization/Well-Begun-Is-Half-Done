macho guys may attract more women , but the quality of their sperm might not be of he-man standards , a new study suggests . oddly , the sperm of good-looking guys—but not necessarily macho ones with square jaws and distinct cheekbones—is just fine , reports medical daily . the link was found when researchers analyzed the semen of 62 caucasian men , then compared its motility and structure to facial measurements of masculine traits and ratings of their attractiveness , the huffington post explains . scientists theorize that the macho man trades virility for a gravely voice and ripped arms , and high testosterone hinders sperm production . meanwhile , the study casts doubt on the belief the " phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis " ( read : fancy feathers and pretty songs attract more ladies ) applies to humans . a study that claimed short guys are preferred by women over tall ones , long believed to have the evolutionary upper hand , has also poked holes in that theory . but do n't revamp your mating habits just yet , girls—researchers say their findings need further study . ( short guys are also less likely to divorce you . )
