america 's favorite big-box retailer may be responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of us jobs since 2001 , fortune reports . according to a new study from the economic policy institute , walmart 's importing of cheap chinese goods resulted in the elimination of 400,000 american jobs between 2001 and 2013 by increasing the us ' trade deficit with china . it 's an estimate the epi calls " conservative . " about three-quarters of those lost jobs were likely manufacturing jobs , fortune reports . " these job losses are particularly destructive because jobs in the manufacturing sector pay higher wages and provide better benefits than most other industries , especially for workers with less than a college education , " the study states . the epi estimates walmart is responsible for more than 15 % of the trade deficit growth from 2001 to 2013 , costing 3.2 million us jobs . fortune reports the epi 's study is based on a 2007 report and—because walmart does n't release specifics on its imports— " guesswork . " needless to say , walmart disagrees with the epi 's findings . " unfortunately , this is an old report with flawed economic analysis that assumed that imports equal job losses and does not take into consideration that countless jobs are added , " fortune quotes a walmart statement . economists agree , pointing to retail and transportation jobs created by importing goods , according to the new york times . in 2013 , walmart announced it would increase its use of american-made goods by $ 50 billion over the next decade . but the epi counters that walmart 's importing of chinese goods has cost 100 us jobs for every one american job it creates with that program .
