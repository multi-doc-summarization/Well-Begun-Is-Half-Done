this story likely wo n't do much to raise comcast 's popularity—or lack thereof . a washington state woman on tuesday reached out to consumer advocate christopher elliott with a problem . she needed to change the name on her comcast bill , and after phone calls and an in-person visit to a comcast location , remained unsuccessful . the bill continued to read : " a -- hole brown . " yes , you read that right . the bill had previously been addressed to " ricardo brown " ( her husband 's name ) but was apparently changed by a comcast employee . brown suspects the alteration occurred after she called to cancel her cable services . wired points out that comcast makes it " frighteningly difficult " to ax services , and brown was indeed redirected to a retention specialist during her call . she says she was " never rude , " but was firm : she wanted to pay the $ 60 termination fee and pare down her services . elliott dove in , first verifying with comcast that the bill had n't been altered by brown and did indeed contain the unfortunate first name . verification made . ( wired verified the story as well . ) a regional vp of communications then called elliott to express that the company has " zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior " ; a comcast director vowed to fire the offending employee . the company 's initial offer to brown : waiving that $ 60 fee . brown expressed to elliott that she thought she deserved more , saying , " i am requesting everything back i paid comcast for doing this to me " —everything meaning two years ' worth of bills . yesterday afternoon , comcast agreed to that . ( this remains perhaps the most memorable comcast customer horror story . )
