a long washington post article on david gregory and the troubles he faces as moderator of nbc 's meet the press has quite a few people wondering what 's going on at the show . as the post explains , the longest-running television program has been declining in the ratings for three years , and is currently the no . 3 sunday talk show . last year , the network brought in a psychological consultant to talk to friends and family members of gregory , who took over the gig after tim russert 's death in 2008 . as the post puts it , that seems " odd " to some , considering gregory has been at nbc almost two decades . multiple blogs picked up on that tidbit , and nbc quickly gave poynter a statement insisting it actually hired " a brand consultant , " not a psychological one , " to better understand how its anchor connects . " the network also says the move is " not unusual . " but the article 's writer tells politico he checked the term " psychological " with the network twice , and it had " no objections then " â€”and it remains in the post story as of this writing . as for gregory 's job , post reporter paul farhi writes that it " does not appear to be in any immediate jeopardy , but there are plenty of signs of concern .
