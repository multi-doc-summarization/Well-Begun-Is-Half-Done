anne hathaway 's nipples got so much attention at the oscars that they now have their own twitter accountâ€”but hathaway was n't even supposed to be wearing the prada dress that showcased them so well . she had originally chosen a valentino dress , and valentino even put out a press release sunday saying hathaway would be wearing one of the fashion house 's designs . but she made a switch after hearing the night before " that there would be a dress worn to the oscars that is remarkably similar to the valentino i had intended to wear , " she tells people in a statement . a source tells us the person in question was hathaway 's own les miserables co-star , amanda seyfried , who wore alexander mcqueen ( you can see a comparison of the two dresses here ) . but hathaway has a longstanding relationship with valentino , who custom-designed her wedding dress , and regrets " any disappointment caused , " she says . " though i love the dress i did wear , it was a difficult last minute decision as i had so looked forward to wearing valentino in honor of the deep and meaningful relationship i have enjoyed with the house and with valentino himself .
