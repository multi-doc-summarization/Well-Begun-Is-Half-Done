a california man named jack yufe died this week at age 82 , and his life story is so fascinating that the ap likens it to a hollywood script nobody would believe ; the los angeles times draws a comparison to a " tabloid headline . " the reason ? yufe was born in trinidad along with an identical twin brother , but their parents split after 6 months . yufe grew up as a jew , even serving a stint in the israeli navy . brother oskar stohr , meanwhile , went to germany with his catholic mom and grew up as a nazi , becoming a member of the hitler youth . they managed to stay in touch and met again at age 21 . the weird part ? despite their incredibly different backgrounds , they were alike in nearly every way . they dressed the same ( both showed up to their first meeting in a white sports jacket and wire-rimmed glasses ) , walked the same , wore the same mustache , and had the same temperament and quirks . they both liked to sneeze loudly to scare people as a joke , and " both used to wash their hands before and after going to the toilet , " says nancy segal , a professor of psychology who studied the pair as part of a well-known study of separated twins at the university of minnesota . the brothers ' story eventually rose to " the center of discussions about nature and nurture , " notes the washington post . though the brothers did n't much like each other at first , that changed over the years . when stohr died of cancer in 1997 , a devastated yufe did n't attend the funeral , however , notes ap . they looked so much alike he was afraid it would upset loved ones . ( a survivor of the nazi death camps ' only mass escape also recently died . )
