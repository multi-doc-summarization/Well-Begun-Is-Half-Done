sure , there was plenty of " hero sex , " but the aftermath of the miracle on the hudson was n't all sunshine and rainbows . it 's that story clint eastwood has chosen to tell in sully , starring tom hanks as pilot chesley sullenberger . here 's what critics are saying : richard roeper at the chicago sun-times calls it " an absolute triumph . " it 's " an electrifying thriller , a wonderful in-depth character study and a fascinating airline safety procedural . " hanks , meanwhile , " is so good he could play this character in a one-man show with nothing but a chair and a telephone onstage and it would be riveting . " " that it unnerves you as much as it does may seem surprising , given that going in , we know how this story ends . " but eastwood is " very good at his job , a talent that gives the movie its tension along with an autobiographical sheen , " writes manohla dargis at the new york times . in particular , he offers " a master class in direction " during the accident scene , while hanks makes a perfect sully . stephen whitty at nj.com says the accident scene is " the best part of the film , " but he 's not so enthralled with the rest of it . basically , he concludes " there 's not enough story " to warrant a feature-length film . flashbacks to sully 's youth " add nothing but time , " while the national transportation board safety board investigation delivers no drama or suspense , he adds . ann hornaday does n't agree . sully is " a four-square , upstanding , rock-solid example of filmmaking at its most direct and honestly affecting , " and is " thoroughly engrossing and exciting to watch , " she writes at the washington post . " to paraphrase the title character , it 's just a movie doing its job . and amen to that . "
