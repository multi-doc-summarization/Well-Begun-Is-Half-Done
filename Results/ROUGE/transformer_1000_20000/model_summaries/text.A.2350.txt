no , doritos and skittles have n't made a baby . doritos is declaring its support for the lgbt community with its new bag of chips , doritos rainbow . the chips are actually cool ranch-flavored but in the colors of the pride flag : green , blue , purple , red , and orange , reports yahoo . do n't go looking for them on store shelves , though . the limited-edition bags will be shipped free of charge only to those who donate at least $ 10 to the it gets better project , which supports lgbt youth around the world . " there 's nothing bolder than being yourself , " reads the chip package . ( then there 's doritos-flavored soda . )
