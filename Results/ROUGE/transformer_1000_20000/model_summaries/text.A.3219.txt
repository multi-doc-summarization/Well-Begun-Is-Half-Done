it 's long seemed unthinkable , but us military personnel could soon see cuts to their pay and benefits . top commanders are considering such cuts as they deal with a decreasing budget , the joint chiefs of staff chair said this weekend . while acknowledging that " we ca n't pay [ soldiers ] enough , " gen. martin dempsey added , " we also have an institution to manage . " no specifics have been revealed ; details will be released along with the proposed military budget in february , the wall street journal reports . dempsey did say benefits would n't be immediately cut , no changes will be made to the retirement system , and that the plan is a multi-year effort to slow down compensation . pay and benefits will soon make up 60 % of the military budget ( currently , the cost of military personnel is about 50 % of the budget ) , meaning that if they 're not curbed , there wo n't be enough money for new weapons or training within the decade , dempsey said . defense secretary chuck hagel and president obama must approve the plan , then congress , and so far it 's not looking too popular with lawmakers . the news comes days after a congressional budget office report that said cutting military pay is one of many options to reduce the budget deficit , military.com reports .
