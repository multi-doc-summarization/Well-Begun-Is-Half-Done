bloomberg lp operates both a multi-platform media organization , bloomberg news , and a computer system , bloomberg terminal , that bankers and traders use to monitor market data . the problem : bloomberg news reporters can see how and when any customer has been using a terminal , and now it turns out they have been using that access to snoop on wall street and break news , the new york times reports . and it may have gone even further than just traders : a former bloomberg staffer now says he also accessed the terminals of ben bernanke and timothy geithner , according to cnbc . the issue was first discovered when a bloomberg reporter asked goldman sachs if a partner had recently left the firm because he had n't recently logged into his terminal , the new york post revealed . jpmorgan claims bloomberg may have used data from terminals to break the " london whale " scandal , the post reports . the times says " several hundred " reporters have used the technique , gaining access to 315,000 subscribers worldwide . bloomberg has called the news-gathering process " a mistake , " and has cut off its journalists ' access , reports the ap . but the damage may already be done : the terminal is bloomberg 's primary money-maker , with firms paying around $ 20,000 a year to use it , and wall street is not happy .
