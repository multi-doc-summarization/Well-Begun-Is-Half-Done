john mccain has put together quite the résumé for himself lately , and it includes the wrath of vladimir putin , isis , fidel castro , and now the regime of bashar al-assad . mccain added those latest bragging rights after bashar ja'afari , the syrian ambassador to the un , yesterday asked the security council and secretary-general ban ki-moon to " take the necessary measures against their nationals who enter syrian territory illegally , " time reports . although ja'afari blasted " certain journalists and prominent figures " for this infraction , he specifically singled out the arizona senator 's entry into the country 's rebel-held territory in june 2013 , reuters reports . mccain took the opportunity yesterday to cheerfully tweet that " today i hit the superfecta ! first i was sanctioned by vladimir putin , then # isis called me 'enemy # 1 . ' " his elation spread into a second tweet , which read " next fidel castro said i created # isis w/ # israel 's mossad and today assad regime tried to sanction me @ un for visit to # syrian rebels . " he elaborated in a more somber statement yesterday : " it is a sad but unsurprising truth that the assad regime is less concerned with its massacre of more than 200,000 men , women , and children than it is my visit with those brave syrians fighting for their freedom and dignity . " ( is mccain trying to add obama to his list ? )
