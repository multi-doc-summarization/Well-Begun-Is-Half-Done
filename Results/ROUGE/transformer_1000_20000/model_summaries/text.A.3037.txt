" our goal is to make google maps available to everyone who wants to use it , regardless of device , browser , or operating system , " the company replied , without elaborating . that seems cagey , so " stay tuned , " writes danny sullivan . a dedicated app ca n't come soon enough for many users . apple 's new maps app is so buggy and confoundable that a tumblr has cropped up for users to post screenshots of its failure , boingboing reports . it 's derisively titled , " the amazing ios 6 maps .
