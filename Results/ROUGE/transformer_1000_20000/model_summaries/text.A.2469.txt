think a mother 's age at childbirth plays any role in her child 's intelligence ? according to data on british kids , it sure does . using information on 18,000 children gathered over " an extended period of time , " researchers from the london school of economics say kids born to first-time moms in their 30s have better cognitive scores and " behavioral outcomes " than first-born children with mothers in their 20s , the independent reports . " first-time mothers in their 30s are , for example , likely to be more educated , have higher incomes , are more likely to be in stable relationships , have healthier lifestyles , seek prenatal care earlier , and have planned their pregnancies , " lead author alice goisis tells the times of london . these kids also outperformed children whose moms were in their 40s . published in biodemography and social biology , the study also found that children born to women in their 40s are more often obese because their moms do n't play with them as much . this despite the fact that moms that age typically smoke less and breastfeed their kids , marie claire notes . but researchers acknowledge they culled data from only 53 mothers in their 40s . there 's also the question of what defines intelligence : " of course kids who have parents with more resources to offer ( i.e. , good schools , tutors , even high-quality nutrition ) are going to do better when it comes to school and tests . but are book learning and intelligence really the same thing ? " asks jacqueline cote at cafe mom . " and i 'm not saying that simply because the two children i had in my 20s are honor students ! really , i 'm not . " ( in the us , more women are waiting until their late 30s to have kids . )
