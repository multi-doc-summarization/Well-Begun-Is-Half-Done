atticus ! harper lee has sued her former literary agent , claiming that he tricked her into signing over the rights and royalties of to kill a mockingbird , reports reuters . the 87-year-old author alleges that samuel pinkus , the son-in-law of her late longtime agent , pulled a fast one on her while she was recovering from a stroke in 2007 . “ pinkus knew that harper lee was an elderly woman with physical infirmities that made it difficult for her to read and see , ” says the complaint filed in federal court yesterday . “ harper lee had no idea she had assigned her copyright . " the story gets a little convoluted from there . the ap says lee is suing to " re-secure " the copyright to the 1960 novel , but bloomberg reports that she actually got the copyright back last year in a separate legal action . it adds , however , that pinkus was still receiving royalties through the legal arrangement he set up in 2007 . the new suit demands that he forfeit all of his mockingbird commissions since the deal . pinkus himself has not responded publicly .
