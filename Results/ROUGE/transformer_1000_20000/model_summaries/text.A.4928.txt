rep. aaron schock , an up-and-comer previously best known for baring his six-pack on the cover of men 's health , has a new claim to fame in the form of his interior decor : it seems the washington post 's style reporter ben terris popped by the illinois rep 's digs in the rayburn house office building , and ran into schock 's interior decorator , who showed him around . terris describes the outer office thusly : " bright red walls . a gold-colored wall sconce with black candles . a federal-style bull ’ s-eye mirror with an eagle perched on top . " " it 's actually based off the red room in downton abbey , " an aide helpfully told terris of his outer office . the rest of terris ' piece describes schock 's team trying to squash the story . usa today took the ball and dug back to 2009 and 2010 and found about $ 118,000 in office expenditures—including $ 4,000 on fine-leather furniture and $ 79,061 on other furniture—that schock billed to a taxpayer-funded account . which is turning into kind of an upstairs-downstairs conundrum : while it 's not yet clear how much the downton renovation cost , schock 's interior decorator says she worked for free , thus saving the taxpayer—but prompting crew to file an ethics complaint claiming that schock illegally received a gift . " perhaps it ’ s not totally surprising that the same congressman who spent campaign money on p90x workout dvds wanted to create a more picturesque setting in which to be photographed , but the rules clearly require him to pay for those renovations himself , " says crew ’ s executive director , per nbc chicago . " again and again , rep. schock ’ s seeming obsession with his image impedes his ability to conduct himself in ethical manner . " the other irony being widely noted : downton airs on pbs , which schock has repeatedly voted to de-fund . schock has yet to comment .
