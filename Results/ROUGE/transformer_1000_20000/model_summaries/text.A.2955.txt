in clash sam worthington plays a half mortal hopelessly in love and stuck between two worlds . sound familiar ? this remake aims for avatar , but falls short . though it has expensive effects ( 3d ! ) and stars ( ralph fiennes ! ) , it even falls short of the cheerfully cheesy original . this movie manages to make avatar 's plot look sophisticated , writes dana stevens on slate . " compared with this witless , chaotic mess of a movie , james cameron 's epic looks worthy of the ancient greek authors . " peter sobczynski of efilmcritic says clash " not only amplifies all of the flaws of the original but even screws up the things that it actually got right the first time around . " " it 's big , it 's loud , and it 's filled with meaningless action , " says filmink 's erin free . the film " pretty much sums up with what 's wrong with hollywood right now . " ralph fiennes , does fine , says the oregonian 's shawn levy . worthington , however , projects " the charisma of the young russell crowe 's lighting double . "
