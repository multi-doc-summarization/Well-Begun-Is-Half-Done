speak the wrong language in front of an african elephant , and she may not like you much . in a study at a kenyan national park , researchers played recordings of different languages and voices for 47 elephant family groups , comprising hundreds of animals . the recordings included the voices of maasai men , whose cattle-herding can cause run-ins with elephants . kamba men , on the other hand , are often farmers or national park workers and present little danger to elephants , afp reports via raw story . while the languages recorded were different , the spoken phrase was the same : " look , look over thereâ€”a group of elephants is coming . " when the elephants heard maasai men , they prepared to protect themselves , sniffing around and moving together . but the voices of kamba men did n't prompt much worry . " they are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills , " a study author tells the ap . " they 're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge . " the elephants also appeared to be able to distinguish between men and women : maasai women 's voices did n't set off major alarm bells , nor did maasai boys ' . the findings come as humans and elephants overlap more often in the park , leading to occasional clashes , discover notes . indeed , the study is " sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing , " says an expert .
