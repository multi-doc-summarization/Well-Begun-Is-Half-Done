bill cosby 's trial for allegedly assaulting andrea constand begins monday , and at least one member of his former tv family will reportedly be watching from the sidelines , per nbc news . keshia knight pulliam , 38 , who played little rudy huxtable on the cosby show , is expected to be in the norristown , pa. , courthouse to watch the proceedings against her 79-year-old former boss , with cosby spokesman andrew wyatt telling people that pulliam wo n't be there to " proclaim guilt or innocence , " but simply " to finally hear the truth for herself . " wyatt says cosby 's wife on the show , phylicia rashad , will also appear in the courtroom at some point , though the new york daily news says it has been told that a rashad appearance monday is " unlikely " because she 's working . reports of malcolm-jamal warner , who played son theo huxtable , attending are similarly being bandied about . the new york times offers an overview of what to expect during the trial— " perhaps america 's highest profile celebrity trial since that of oj simpson " —including expected lines of evidence , the cosby legal team 's anticipated strategy , and some juror information . cnn says the trial has come down to a " he said-she said " scenario , with one other alleged victim expected to testify against cosby in addition to constand . " what cosby is hoping for is that the jury forgets about the other 48 [ alleged victims ] , " a fordham criminal law professor notes . meanwhile , constand herself is reportedly ready to face intense grilling on the witness stand . " there 's no trepidation , no fear , " a close friend who 's also one of cosby 's alleged victims tells nbc . " she used to play basketball and she prepared for those games like nobody else and that is what she has done here . " ( vice calls the trial a " test for america . " )
