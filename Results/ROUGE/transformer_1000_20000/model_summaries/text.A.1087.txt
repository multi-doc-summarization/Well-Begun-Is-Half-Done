around 20 mlb players—including stars alex rodriguez and ryan braun—could soon be suspended for their ties to the miami clinic at the center of a long-brewing performance-enhancing drug scandal , inside sources tell espn 's outside the lines . clinic founder tony bosch is reported to have reached an agreement with the league to verify the names of the athletes to whom the now-closed biogenesis of america supplied peds ; he 'll also reportedly provide supporting documentation . in response , sources say , the mlb will drop its lawsuit against bosch , indemnify him against any liability , and even provide him with personal security . bosch 's cooperation has been corroborated by the ap . bosch , who previously denied any knowledge of the peds , is reportedly set to begin sharing info with lawyers and investigators on friday ; assuming the league gets the evidence it needs , the suspensions announcement could come within two weeks . the suspensions may be for as long as 100 games , says espn , the penalty generally reserved for second doping offenses . the argument is that the players ' connection to bosch is an offense in and of itself , and their previous denials of that connection to league officials is the second .
