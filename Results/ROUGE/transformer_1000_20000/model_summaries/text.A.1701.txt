it is one of the craziest custody disputes you could imagine . a city in oklahoma wants the state to give it back " old sparky , " an electric chair last used about 50 years ago . mcalester officials want to put it on display as a piece of history . but the state says it 's keeping old sparky in storage , just in case the relic needs to be fired up again . " that would be possible , " a state doc spokesperson tells the mcalester news-capital . old sparky had its heyday from 1915 to 1966 , when it was used to execute 82 inmates at the oklahoma state penitentiary in mcalester . it now sits mothballed in a state facility , as the city and the doc bicker over who owns it . the newspaper has a letter from the doc to the city in 2010 in which it explains why the state needed to keep the chair . “ in the event our lethal injection protocol is ruled unconstitutional , the electric chair must be used by the state as the back-up method of execution . " that might have seemed far-fetched at the time , but the state 's lethal injection policies are now , in fact , under review after the botched execution of an inmate last month . tennessee , meanwhile , just brought back its electric chair . all that is understood , says mcalester 's mayor , but ... old sparky ? “ that chair has not been used since 1966 , ” steve harrison tells the guardian . “ my assumption would be if it ever got to the point the electric chair was needed again they would start with a new one .
