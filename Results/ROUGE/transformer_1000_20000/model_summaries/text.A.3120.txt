bill gates recently helmed a bill & melinda gates foundation meeting with staff , and per the guardian , he offered some anecdotes involving president trump . in the footage aired thursday night on msnbc , gates noted that when he first met trump in late 2016 , it was " kind of scary " how much trump seemed to know about his adult daughter jennifer 's appearance . " melinda did n't like that too well , " he said . he also noted that in that 2016 meeting , as well as in a subsequent one in march 2017 , trump threw out a question that actually threw gates during a discussion about vaccines . " both times he wanted to know if there was a difference between hiv and hpv , " gates told his audience . " so i was able to explain that those are rarely confused with each other . " trump apparently is n't the only one who may have harbored uncertainty about the viruses : the guardian points out the uk 's national health service website features a dedicated page with the question " what 's the difference between hpv and hiv ? " still , jokes flew online about the president possibly not having a handle on this . " guys , we could probably get him to stop watching fox and friends by telling him it has hdtv , " one twitter user snarked . one other gates anecdote that drew laughs : " when i walked in , his first sentence kind of threw me off . he said : 'trump hears that you do n't like what trump is doing . ' and i thought , 'wow , but you 're trump . ' " ( where the two men rank on forbes ' billionaire list . )
