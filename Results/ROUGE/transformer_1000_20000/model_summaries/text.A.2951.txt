martin shkreli 's lawyer may think his client is " brilliant beyond words , " but the convicted pharmaceutical exec 's latest move on social media was n't exactly a genius one . per lawnews , the justice department filed a motion thursday to revoke shkreli 's $ 5 million bail after a now-deleted facebook post he made earlier this week made weirdly threatening comments directed toward hillary clinton . " on hrc 's book tour , try to grab a hair from her , " he wrote , adding he 'd compensate anyone who did so for their efforts : " will pay $ 5,000 per hair obtained from hillary clinton . " the doj says his remarks show he 's a " danger to the community , " per usa today . the motion notes that a " significant expenditure of resources " now has to be put out by the secret service staff tasked with protecting clinton ( she 's afforded such protection as a former first lady ) . shkreli tried to defuse the situation by posting , " it was just a prank , bro ! " on facebook thursday evening , followed by an expletive-tinged rant against the " government " and a dare to " come at me with you hardest because i have n't seen anything impressive yet . " shkreli 's attorneys need to file a response to the doj motion by tuesday ; a thursday hearing will follow . ( it may be hard for him to concentrate on his ebay auction with all of this going on . )
