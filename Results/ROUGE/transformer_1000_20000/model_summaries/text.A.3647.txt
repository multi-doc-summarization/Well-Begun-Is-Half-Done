president trump slammed the " disgraceful " verdict thursday after a mexican citizen was found not guilty of murder in the 2015 shooting death of kate steinle at a san francisco pier . " no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration , " trump tweeted thursday night , and he kept up his criticism friday morning . " build the wall ! " he wrote . jose ines garcia zarate , a 45-year-old undocumented immigrant who had already been deported from the us five times , was also acquitted by a jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon , cnn reports . steinle was fatally shot on july 1 , 2015 , as she walked on pier 14 . zarate 's defense attorneys said he found a handgun wrapped in a shirt under a chair and it accidentally went off as he picked it up , nbc reports . the gun turned out to have been stolen from a federal agent days earlier , and prosecutors argued that zarate deliberately pointed it at the 32-year-old steinle . zarate—who was wanted for a sixth deportation when he was arrested for the shooting—was found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will be sentenced at a later date . months before the shooting , zarate was released under san francisco 's " sanctuary city " policy , and trump complained friday that he " came back and back over the weakly protected obama border . " he added that the " schumer/pelosi democrats " are weak on crime and " will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections . " steinle died in the arms of her father , jim steinle , who tells the san francisco chronicle that the family is shocked and saddened by the verdict . " justice was rendered but not served , " he says .
