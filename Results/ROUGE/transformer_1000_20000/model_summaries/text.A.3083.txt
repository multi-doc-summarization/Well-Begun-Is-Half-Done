a sad , strange tale out of utah : a 54-year-old man who set off from kansas on an unexplained road trip crashed his vehicle in remote utah , and it was n't until seven weeks later that a hiker spotted the wreck with david welch 's body inside , reports cnn . but there 's also this detail : welch survived for days and perhaps weeks while trapped in his van and used the time to write love letters to his wife and four sons , reports the salt lake city tribune . it remains unclear why welch took off without explanation on sept. 2 . his family notified authorities that very day that he was missing , but subsequent searches turned up nothing . his final notes are n't being made public . police speculate that welch fell asleep at the wheel , causing his vehicle to go off a curve and into a ravine below . he was about 900 miles away from home . " it â€™ s a pretty lonely stretch out there , " says a utah highway patrolman .
