so much for enjoying one 's golden years . mel gibson 's 93-year-old dad yesterday filed for divorce from his 70-something wife of 10 years . though tmz reports that hutton gibson marked the typical " irreconcilable differences " on his filing , the site also reports that the gibsons apparently believe teddy joye has been abusing the patriarch . the row apparently boils down to the many medications the " seriously ill " hutton is on . mel & co. want to make sure he 's taking his medicine , while teddy apparently thinks medicating him is just dragging out his pain , and wants to call it quits on the meds so he 'll die faster . that apparently has the younger gibson crying elder abuse . tmz adds that hutton gibson is seeking spousal support . the million-dollar question : is this parent-of-celeb mess juicier than this one ?
