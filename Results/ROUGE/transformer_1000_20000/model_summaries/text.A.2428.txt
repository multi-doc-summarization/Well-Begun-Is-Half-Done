talk about a surprise : two years ago , scientists researching avian malaria happened to learn that two strains of the parasite are infecting white-tailed deer—possibly 25 % of those living on the east coast , smithsonian reports . until then , no endemic malaria had been seen in north or south american mammals . " you never know what you 're going to find when you 're out in nature—and you look , " says lead study author ellen martinsen , per a press release . " it 's a parasite that has been hidden in the most iconic game animal in the united states . i just stumbled across it . " her team was screening mosquitoes for avian malaria at the smithsonian 's national zoo in washington , dc , when they stumbled across some surprise dna and found that the insect had fed on white-tailed deer . researchers then screened more than 300 white-tailed deer and found the parasite in 41 of them , in roughly half the states studied , science reports . none were in the west , but it was common in the east , particularly in west virginia and virginia . seems the two malaria species pose little risk to deer or to people : though humans have n't been tested for the strains yet , co-author robert fleischer says " if it ’ s getting into humans , which it probably is , it probably isn ’ t able to reproduce . ... this is not zika virus . " the deer 's ancestors may have brought the parasite into north america by way of the beringia land bridge millions of years ago , researchers say . so how is it no one noticed malaria before in the much-studied deer ? " this story suggests there is still much we don ’ t know about the natural world , " says a biologist not involved in the study . ( meanwhile , lyme disease is spreading across us counties . )
