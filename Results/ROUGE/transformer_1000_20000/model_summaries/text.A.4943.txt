a lawyer for tamir rice 's family calls it the cruelest thing he 's ever seen . in newly released surveillance video , two cleveland police officers can be seen pushing the boy 's 14-year-old sister to the ground as she tried to run to her brother 's side just 90 seconds after he had been fatally shot by another officer . after a struggle , she is handcuffed and placed in the back of a squad car just a few feet from where her 12-year-old brother lay dying , reports cleveland.com , which obtained the video after what it calls " protracted talks " with city officials who initially refused to release it . the video shows that in the minutes after the shooting , police stood around the wounded boy , who had been carrying a pellet gun , but made no attempt to offer first aid . the first person to begin first aid was an fbi agent who arrived around four minutes after the shooting , the ap reports . tamir , who had been shot in the abdomen , was n't pronounced dead until nine hours later . " how inhumane to put her in handcuffs and sit her in the car about 4 feet from where her brother lay dying and she has to watch that , " another lawyer tells the new york times . " and they rendered no aid to this kid . " tim loehmann , the rookie officer who fired the fatal shot seconds after arriving on the scene , was found unfit to serve in his previous police job . prosecutors are expected to present the case to a grand jury to determine whether loehmann and his partner should face criminal charges .
