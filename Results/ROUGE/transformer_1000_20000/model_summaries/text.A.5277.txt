the south african government has begun the controversial process of seizing land from white farmers in cases where negotiations to purchase the plots have fallen through . per newsweek , two game farms in the country 's limpopo province will be the first ones taken under the order after their owners declined to sell for a government offer that was a tenth of the asking price . while south african authorities say they still intend to pay johan steenkamp and arnold cloete , the owners of the land , the equivalent of $ 1.37 million , the men had priced the land at $ 13.7 million . per news.com.au , the farmers ' landholding company , akkerland boerdery , was sent a letter in april regarding an audit of the land that would be conducted by the government . akkerland boerdery reportedly received an injunction to prevent their eviction , however the country 's department of rural development and land affairs has opposed the injunction . should the seizures go through , it would reportedly be the first case of the government refusing to pay market value . under existing laws , such a seizure is allowed only if it 's in the public interest . since the end of apartheid , the government has only redistributed land to black south africans only from willing white sellers .
