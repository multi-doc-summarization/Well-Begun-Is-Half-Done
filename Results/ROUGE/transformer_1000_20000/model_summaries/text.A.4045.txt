two explorers managed to finish their re-creation today of ernest shackleton 's famous survival journey from the antarctic to south georgia island—but only after a blizzard stranded them on a high , icy plateau for hours , reports the australian times . using only period gear and food , tim jarvis and barry gray had already completed a 12-day , 800-mile sea voyage in a wooden lifeboat from the site of shackleton 's original shipwreck on elephant island to south georgia island , but tough conditions forced four members of their crew to drop out . the journey then required a 32-mile trek across the island , over mountains up to 2,950-feet high , to reach on old whaling station , which is when rain , snow , and 45-knot winds forced the men to take shelter for 12 hours in a tent—a modern tent with modern sleeping bags , notes global post , along with some extra food supplied by their modern support team . but today , jarvis and gray completed the arduous journey . " there ’ s no doubt in my mind that everyone has a shackleton double in them and i hope we ’ ve inspired a few people to find theirs , " says jarvis . some of shackleton 's long-lost scotch was last month returned to antarctica .
