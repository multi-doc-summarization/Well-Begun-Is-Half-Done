confusion reigns in the aftermath of today 's oil platform explosion in the gulf of mexico . this much good news stands : all 13 crew members were rescued from the water . everything else is changing quickly . the coast guard spoke of a mile-long oil slick at the site but now says it ca n't find evidence of any oil in the water . early reports said the platform was n't producing any oil or gas , but louisiana governor bobby jindal now says it had seven active wells . the coast guard has n't confirmed reports that crew members were able to shut them down before bailing . the platform , owned by houston 's mariner energy , was producing 59,000 gallons of oil and 900,000 cubic feet of gas per day and could store 4,200 gallons of oil , reports the ap , citing federal figures . if there is a spill of some sort , the relatively shallow depth of 340 feet should make cleanup easier . more coverage in the times-picayune and usa today .
