" on friday , malaysian officials announced that kim jong nam was killed with a deadly nerve agent called vx . authorities think aisyah and another woman wiped it on his face in the crowded airport in kuala lumpur , perhaps as a kind of one-two punchâ€”one woman smeared one compound , the other a second , and they combined to create the nerve agent . for the record , malaysian officials have said they 're not buying aisyah 's story that she was duped , notes the guardian . one other person is in custody , a north korean male who lives in malaysia , and authorities say seven other north korean suspects are being sought , reports the wall street journal .
