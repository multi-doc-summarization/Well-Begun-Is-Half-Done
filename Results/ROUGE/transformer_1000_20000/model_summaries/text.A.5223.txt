when alan rickman started playing professor severus snape , the end of the harry potter series was not yet written—but jk rowling already had snape 's story arc figured out , and she hinted to rickman that ( spoiler alert ! ) there was more to snape than met the eye so that he 'd understand the character 's motivation and know how to play him . rickman had hinted at that fact in interviews , mashable reports , but he never revealed exactly what rowling told him—but now rowling finally has , thanks to a fan on twitter who asked her , " will you tell us the piece of information that you told alan rickman about severus snape ? or will that forever be a secret ? " as the independent explains , rickman once said that rowling did n't reveal the entire ending of the series to him , but rather gave him " one little piece of information , which i always said i would never share with anybody and never have , and never will , " and that helped him " travel down that road rather than that one or that one or that one . " rowling 's response to the aforementioned fan explains what that " one little piece " was : " i told alan what lies behind the word 'always , ' " she wrote . spoiler alert part 2 : she 's referring to the fact that , as snape reveals to dumbledore toward the end of the series , he 's " always " loved harry 's mother , and thus felt compelled to protect harry . ( watch snape 's scenes in chronological order and all will become clear . )
