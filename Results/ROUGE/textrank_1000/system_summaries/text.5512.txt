ndon , nov 16 ( thomson reuters foundation ) - the first map showing the world 's hidden groundwater was published on monday , bringing us closer to estimating how much there is , and when it will run out if we over-use the resource . newline_char using data and computer models , an international team of researchers estimated that less than six percent and perhaps as little as one percent of water found close to the earth 's surface is renewable in a human lifetime . newline_char " the study , published in the journal nature geoscience , estimated a total volume of underground water to be almost 23 million cubic kilometres , of which 0.35 million cubic kilometres is younger than 50 years old . newline_char although water found closer to the surface is being renewed quicker than the water found deeper in the earth , it is more sensitive to contamination and climate change , but it can also serve to temper climate extremes , gleeson said . newline_char " according to the study , most groundwater is found in tropical and mountainous regions , with some of the largest deposits in the amazon basin , the congo , indonesia and along the western borders of north and south america . story_separator_special_tag old groundwater is found deeper and is often used as a water resource for agriculture and industry . newline_char the volume of modern groundwater dwarfs all other components of the active water cycle and is a more renewable resource but , because it 's closer to surface water and is faster-moving than old groundwater , it 's also more vulnerable to climate change and contamination by human activities .
