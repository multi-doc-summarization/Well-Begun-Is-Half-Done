sults the overall suicide rate among children aged 5 to 11 years remained stable between 1993 to 1997 and 2008 to 2012 ( from 1.18 to 1.09 per 1 million ; irr = 0.96 ; 95 % ci , 0.90-1.03 ) . newline_char however , the suicide rate increased significantly in black children ( from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million ; irr = 1.27 ; 95 % ci , 1.11-1.45 ) and decreased in white children ( from 1.14 to 0.77 per 1 million ; irr = 0.86 ; 95 % ci , 0.79-0.94 ) . newline_char the overall firearm suicide rate ( irr = 0.69 ; 95 % ci , 0.57-0.85 ) and firearm suicide rate among white boys ( irr = 0.72 ; 95 % ci , 0.59-0.88 ) decreased significantly during the study . newline_char conclusions and relevance the stable overall suicide rate in school-aged children in the united states during 20 years of study obscured a significant increase in suicide incidence in black children and a significant decrease in suicide incidence among white children . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag the overall suicide rate among children between the ages of five and 11 was stable during the 20 years from 1993 to 2012 , but that stability obscured racial differences that show an increase in suicide among black children and a decrease among white children . newline_char however , the researchers found that that stability resulted from divergent trends in suicide for black and white children during those 20 years . newline_char although the changes were not statistically significant among girls , the suicide rate among black girls increased from 0.68 to 1.23 per one million during the 20-year period , while the suicide rate among white girls remained stable from 0.25 to 0.24 per one million , according to the study â€™ s findings .
