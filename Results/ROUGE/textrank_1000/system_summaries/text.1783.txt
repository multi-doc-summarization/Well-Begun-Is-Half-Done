tory_separator_special_tag what were the 11 words ? newline_char when the federal government said it would finally release a declassified copy of the pentagon papers on monday , 40 years after they were published by the new york times , it initially said it would keep 11 words secret . newline_char then it reversed itself , saying it would publish the 7,000-page report in its entirety . newline_char the intrigue sparked a guessing game among historians , security analysts and even the authors of the report : which 11 words in the once-secret government study of the vietnam war were still deemed sensitive in the age of wikileaks ? newline_char daniel ellsberg , the former rand corporation analyst who worked on the report and later provided it to the times as part of an effort to stop the war , said in an interview that he was stumped . newline_char “ of course , i don ’ t know what they are , ’ ’ he said . newline_char gelb , the director of the task force that wrote the report . newline_char “ i couldn ’ t begin to guess where those words came from , ’ ’ he said , before hazarding a guess that they might come from the sections on peace negotiations , which were left out of the first versions of the report that were leaked . newline_char it sounded like a job for twitter , if not for its large community of indiscreet intelligence analysts , then because 140 characters seemed just about right for 11 words . newline_char so the new york times asked readers to post their guesses with the hashtag # pentagon11 . newline_char please keep ’ em coming ! newline_char send a twitter message using # pentagon11 or submit your guesses in the comments box below .
