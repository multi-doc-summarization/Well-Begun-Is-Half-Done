chael nolan/robert harding world imagery/corbis boat trips to watch whales and dolphins may increasingly be putting the survival of marine mammals at risk , conservationists have warned . newline_char but some animals are affected more than others and the long-term effects remain unclear , scientists at the international marine conservation congress ( imcc ) in glasgow , uk , heard last week . newline_char earlier this year , for example , marine biologist david lusseau of the university of aberdeen , uk , and his team showed that minke whales ( balaenoptera acutorostrata ) in faxaflói bay in iceland responded to whale-watching boats as they do to natural predators , upping their speed and respiring more heavily1 . newline_char but whether this was a direct result of the boats is difficult to pin down : lusseau , who was not at the meeting , says that soon-to-be-published research by his team shows that behavioural changes are probably not affecting actual numbers of the minke in faxaflói bay . newline_char the large number of dolphin-watching trips in the sound is driving the animals away from their preferred areas and forcing them to avoid boats instead of feeding . story_separator_special_tag watching whales and dolphins in their natural habitats may seem like a good alternative to seeing them in aquariums , but some scientists say that the activity may be putting the marine mammals at risk . newline_char the effects of whale-watching excursions are unclear , but scientists worry it may cause behavioral changes in whales and dolphins , such as not feeding or swimming away from boats , which takes energy . newline_char vanessa williams-grey , head of the responsible whale watch program at the whale and dolphin conservation society , told the bbc in 2011 that the industry could be harmful to marine mammals .
