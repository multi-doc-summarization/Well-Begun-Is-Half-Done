ars from now—maybe in a decade , maybe sooner—if all goes according to plan , the most complex machine ever built will be switched on in an alpine forest in the south of france . newline_char the machine , called the international thermonuclear experimental reactor , or iter , will stand a hundred feet tall , and it will weigh twenty-three thousand tons—more than twice the weight of the eiffel tower . newline_char at its core , densely packed high-precision equipment will encase a cavernous vacuum chamber , in which a super-hot cloud of heavy hydrogen will rotate faster than the speed of sound , twisting like a strand of dna as it circulates . newline_char in this way , the circulating hydrogen will become ionized , and achieve temperatures exceeding two hundred million degrees celsius—more than ten times as hot as the sun at its blazing core . newline_char even the iter organization , a makeshift scientific united nations , assembled eight years ago to construct the machine , is unprecedented . newline_char thirty-five countries , representing more than half the world ’ s population , are invested in the project , which is so complex to finance that it requires its own currency : the iter unit of account . story_separator_special_tag iter , the international fusion reactor project in france , is reeling from an assessment that found serious problems with the project 's leadership , management , and governance . newline_char the report is so damning , science has learned , that after a 13 february special session that reviewed and accepted the report 's conclusions and recommendations , the iter council—the project 's governing body—restricted its readership to a small number of senior managers and council members . newline_char : the executive summary of the report on management of the international iter fusion reactor project was published today by the new yorker .
