tory_separator_special_tag a prominent hypothesis of hemispheric specialization for human speech and music states that the left and right auditory cortices ( acs ) are respectively specialized for precise calculation of two canonically-conjugate variables : time and frequency . newline_char , the mathematical basis of the spectral-temporal asymmetry ) to frame mustached bat literature , we show that recent findings in bat ac ( 1 ) support the notion that hemispheric specialization for speech and music is based on hemispheric differences in temporal and spectral resolution , ( 2 ) discredit closed-system , handedness , and brain-volume theories , ( 3 ) underscore the importance of sex differences , and ( 4 ) provide new avenues for phonological research . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag washington -- researchers from georgetown university medical center and american university have shown that , like humans , mustached bats use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds . newline_char " these findings upset the notion that only humans use different sides of their brains to distinguish different aspects of sound , " says the study 's senior author , stuart washington , phd , a neuroscientist at georgetown . newline_char washington says the findings of asymmetrical sound processing in both human and bat brains make evolutionary sense . newline_char " bats need to use the fast timing of the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds from each other , because their communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency . newline_char " the bats also need to use the slow timing of the right hemisphere to use sonar -- which relies on detecting small changes in frequency -- to track the velocity of the fast-moving insects they fly after and eat , " washington says .
