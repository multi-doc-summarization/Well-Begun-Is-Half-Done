searchers ought to be able to duplicate the findings of other scientists â€™ work , but a new study suggests that many published psychology results ca n't be recreated . newline_char a huge , collaborative research project attempted to recreate 100 studies that were recently published in major psychology journals , and it found that only 39 of those studies ' results could be replicated . newline_char the scientists attempting to reproduce studies tried to hew closely to the originals ; they even worked with the original researchers and published their study designs for feedback from the over 270 people who worked on the reproduction project . story_separator_special_tag direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data . newline_char we conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available . newline_char here , we evaluated reproducibility using significance and p values , effect sizes , subjective assessments of replication teams , and meta-analysis of effect sizes . newline_char conclusion no single indicator sufficiently describes replication success , and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility . newline_char nonetheless , collectively these results offer a clear conclusion : a large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors , review in advance for methodological fidelity , and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes . newline_char moreover , correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence ( such as original p value ) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research ( such as experience and expertise ) .
