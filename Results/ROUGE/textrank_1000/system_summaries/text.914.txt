tory_separator_special_tag when news of the second came a few weeks ago , i felt a different kind of shock . newline_char even though i was ten years younger than the time they say you need to start , it felt like time to start , and when her news came i thought : i need to do this right now . newline_char but anomalies in women 's bodies come and go all the time , and it was a fluid whatever-thing , something that would pass , definitely not a lump , nothing that my waking , speaking mind would grasp as danger . newline_char this anomaly must be misplaced anxiety , my logic-brain tried to explain to my lizard-brain ; maybe it 's me wanting to make my friend 's bad news all about me . newline_char over the phone , the clinics all sounded like places you 'd take a pork chop to be examined , not a human breast , not a person , and not me . newline_char i googled around and found a place with a lot of stars on yelp and other online ratings services from women who 'd gone and felt they 'd been treated well . newline_char the morning i went in for my first mammogram , i felt nervous . newline_char i would tweet this new thing , like i do with lots of new things , and make the unknown and new feel less so . newline_char inviting the internet in is something i do every day anyway , but this time it was like a shield . newline_char nothing bad can happen in a new place if you 're cracking jokes and 50,000 people are watching . newline_char how can anything go bad when the doctor 's name is funk , and there are so many funny things to tweet ?
