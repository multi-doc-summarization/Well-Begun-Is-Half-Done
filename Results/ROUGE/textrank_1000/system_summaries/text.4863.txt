 wednesday , researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered , the remains of bacteria thriving on earth not long , geologically speaking , after the very birth of the planet . newline_char william schopf , a paleontologist at the university of california , los angeles , and his colleagues found what that they , too , argued were the world ’ s oldest fossils : chainlike blobs in 3.46 billion-year-old rocks made , they said , by bacteria . story_separator_special_tag last august , for example , a paper claimed to show the remnants of stromatolites ( small mounds built by communities of shallow water microorganisms ) in 3.7 billion-year-old rocks in greenland . newline_char now , a new study led by university college london phd student matthew dodd describes evidence of what the researchers believe to be seafloor bacteria that lived at least 3.7 billion years ago . newline_char but within some jasper in the hydrothermal vent layers , the researchers found tiny tubes and filaments filled with hematite , an iron oxide mineral . newline_char ” all this , the researchers say , is consistent with iron-oxidizing bacteria that we find at hydrothermal vents today , as well as slightly less ancient fossil examples . newline_char the researchers think that this set of minerals reflects reactions between organic matter and the iron precipitating from the hydrothermal vents—supporting a biological origin . newline_char this new paper is particularly interesting because it involves hydrothermal vent environments , which have been proposed as a logical place where life on earth could have had its origins . newline_char any evidence supporting that idea also makes hydrothermal vents on other worlds look more and more like priority targets in the search for life beyond our home planet .
