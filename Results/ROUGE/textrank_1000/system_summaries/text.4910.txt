r decades , physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes . newline_char to solve it , students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag credit : nasa ( phys.org ) —alexander klotz a student at mcgill university in canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question , how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the earth ? newline_char that is a physics question put to students every year , and those who give it expect the answer to be 42 minutes . newline_char the accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into account the constantly changing impact that gravity will have ( and ignoring drag due to the presence of air ) on the person falling , becoming less and less of a factor as the center of the earth is approached then growing stronger and stronger as the person heads " up " against gravity on the other side . newline_char but klotz argues that it is time to start taking the different densities of the earth 's layers into consideration—after all , a lot of research has shown that our planet is a lot denser at the center than at the crust for example—and that of course would have an impact on the person falling through . newline_char he has used seismic data to calculate the different densities at different depths and has used that data to give a more accurate answer to the falling man question , stating that it would in fact , take just 38 minutes ( and 11 seconds ) to fall all the way through , not 42 and ( 12 seconds ) .
