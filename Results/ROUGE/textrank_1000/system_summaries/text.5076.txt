e “ protective mechanism for an electronic device ” patent application says it aims to prevent some or all of the damage to any electronic device with a processor – such as a tablet or a laptop – but specifically mentions the iphone . newline_char here , the patent application suggests a number of solutions : the movement of a weighted mass within the device ; aeroplane-like foils that extend out from the surface of the device ; and a thrust mechanism such as a small gas-propulsion device . story_separator_special_tag for example , apple 's iphone is specifically mentioned in the patent language.in order to work , the system needs a sensor or sensor array that can detect when a device is in freefall and how it is positioned relative to the ground . newline_char coupled to the sensor is a processor that can help determine a freefall state , including how fast a device is falling , how far away it is from the ground and time to impact , among other metrics . newline_char here , the patent calls for a number of solutions , including the movement of a weighted mass within the device , a means to " grip a plug " to prevent a freefall , lift foils that can be extended out from the surface of a device , and a thrust mechanism such as a can of gas , among other countermeasures.basically , the sensor send signals to the processor , which determines if a device is in a freefall state . newline_char in order to lessen the blow , or avoid it entirely , the protective mechanism can substantially change the angular velocity , device positioning or device rotation.from the patent overview : alternative embodiments focus on using internal motors used to grasp onto inserted cables to break a fall , extend air foils or aerodynamic lift members , and retract vital parts like switches .
