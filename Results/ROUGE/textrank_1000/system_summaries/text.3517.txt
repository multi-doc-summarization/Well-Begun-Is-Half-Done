tarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins ( afps ) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth . newline_char our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome afp-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice . newline_char abstract antifreeze proteins ( afps ) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that , by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of internalized environmental ice crystals , they prevent death by inoculative freezing . newline_char to investigate if ice inside high-latitude antarctic notothenioid fishes could melt seasonally , we measured its melting point and obtained a decadal temperature record from a shallow benthic fish habitat in mcmurdo sound , antarctica . story_separator_special_tag 23 ( upi ) -- fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over . newline_char they discovered the antifreeze proteins ' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens . newline_char " we discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in antarctic notothenioid fishes , " study author paul cziko , a doctoral student the university of oregon 's institute of ecology and evolution , said in a press release . newline_char if water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point , these ice crystals are likely to melt . story_separator_special_tag scientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of antarctic fish survive in frigid waters . newline_char the proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish , but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting .
