don ’ t make a habit of bar-crawling on weekday nights the way i did when i was in my 20s and working in d.c. now i live in los angeles , where i ’ m a freelancer whose meetings mostly take place over coffee and whose friends are more likely to suggest we go for a hike than a cocktail . newline_char in it , writer kristi coulter makes a deft and passionate argument that modern women drink to excess to escape the realities of living in a still-too-sexist world . newline_char “ i see that booze is the oil in our motors , the thing that keeps us purring when we should be making other kinds of noise , ” writes coulter , who is now sober . newline_char coulter describes blowing off steam after serving on a sexist panel at work by drinking manhattans and eating some expensive tapas with her female friends . newline_char “ maybe all that wine is an instagram filter for our own lives , so we don ’ t see how sallow and cracked they ’ ve become , ” she writes . newline_char naturally , coulter ’ s firm conclusion — that women drink to cope with the pressures of living in a sexist society — has attracted some critics . story_separator_special_tag my plan is to work the room with my soda and lime , make sure i ’ m seen by the five people who care about these things , and leave before things get sloppy ( which they always do ) . newline_char but it also dawns on me that the women are super double tanked — that to be a modern , urbane woman means to be a serious drinker . newline_char a woman drinking mommyjuice wine is saying she ’ s more than the unpaid labor she gave birth
