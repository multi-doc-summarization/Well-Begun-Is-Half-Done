rne saw us flying around the world , traveling to the center of the earth ( not a great idea , it turns out ) and to the moon , but i bet he never imagined that just 110 years after his death , we 'd be working on a robot submarine to probe the flammable seas of a distant world . newline_char earlier this month , nasa published the below video introducing its concept submarine designed to explore kraken mare , one of the methane seas on titan , the remarkably strange moon circling saturn . newline_char in addition to floating or diving around checking out the chemistry of titan 's sea and sea floor composition , the sub could also study the moon 's tides , weather , shoreline , disappearing islands and keep an eye out for any evidence of really weird life forms that like to hang out in super chilly , gassy locales . story_separator_special_tag these super-low temperatures and thick atmosphere combine to create the feature scientists are so anxious to study in detail — vast lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane . newline_char data from the voyager , cassini , and huygens ( deployed by cassini ) probes have confirmed that there are three large polar seas on titan ’ s surface , and the largest of them is known as kraken mare . newline_char nasa engineers estimate the titan submarine would weigh in at about one ton and make use of electrically-powered turbines to get around the liquid methane lake . newline_char titan is far from the sun , making solar power inefficient , and the sub would spend most of its time beneath the surface where solar panels wouldn ’ t work anyway . newline_char surfacing and diving will be controlled with ballast tanks , just like an earth-bound sub , but the details have yet to be worked out .
