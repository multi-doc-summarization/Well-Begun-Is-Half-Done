lar vortex may help winter come in like a lamb , go out like a lion irregularity in polar winds may create warm start , cold end to winter image 1 of / 1 caption close image 1 of 1 andrea lang , an assistant professor of atmospheric and environmental science at the university of albany , studies the polar vortex . newline_char less andrea lang , an assistant professor of atmospheric and environmental science at the university of albany , studies the polar vortex . newline_char now stronger than average , the vortex — made up of high-speed , high-altitude winds that spin around the north pole each winter — should keep arctic cold penned in through the start of the christmas season or so , according to andrea lang , an assistant professor of atmospheric and environmental science who studies the vortex . newline_char retreating sea ice around the north pole seems to be causing that vortex to weaken and loosen its shape , which the last two winters allowed extreme cold to plunge much farther south in the northeast , including the capital region , while places untouched by the vortex , like alaska , saw record heat and little snow . newline_char more information watch university at albany climate expert andrea lang talk about the polar vortex on the weather channel online at : http : //bit.ly/1l2rtjk http : //bit.ly/1k2wl9l a warmer winter matches up with national long-range weather forecasts , which credit a stronger el nino warming effect in the pacific ocean . newline_char but lang said a stronger-than-average polar vortex at the start of winter has a greater chance to grow increasingly unstable as the season progresses , making it more likely that the vortex could become more misshapen , sending late blasts of cold air and snow to some southerly regions . story_separator_special_tag
