e estimated chance of whether such a mega-earthquake would hit california in the next three decades was raised to 7 % from about 4.7 % , the u.s. geological survey said tuesday . newline_char such powerful quakes are relatively rare — scientists believe the last mega-quake to hit southern california was a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 1857 . newline_char all three of the largest , most recent earthquakes in california have pushed beyond fault boundaries , " jumping from one fault to another , " field said . newline_char more recently , the magnitude 7.2 earthquake in 2010 that was centered near the california-mexico border on easter sunday jumped faults . newline_char the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that hit off the japanese coast in 2011 also jumped fault boundaries , " resulting in a much larger fault-rupture area and magnitude than expected , and contributing to the deadly tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster , " the usgs report said . story_separator_special_tag ( associated press ) the chance of a magnitude-8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 percent from 4.7 percent , mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once , releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction . newline_char while the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates , it 's more likely — greater than 99 percent chance — that california will be rattled by a magnitude-6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 northridge disaster . newline_char the chance of a northridge-size quake was slightly higher in northern california than southern california — 95 percent versus 93 percent , according to a report released tuesday by the u.s. geological survey . newline_char back then , scientists also determined that california faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a northridge-size quake .
