i : 10.1001/jama.2011.90 axillary dissection vs no axillary dissection in women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis a randomized clinical trial next section abstract context sentinel lymph node dissection ( slnd ) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer , but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival . newline_char objective to determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection ( alnd ) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node ( sln ) metastasis of breast cancer . newline_char conclusion among patients with limited sln metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy , the use of slnd alone compared with alnd did not result in inferior survival . newline_char trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier : nct00003855 axillary lymph node dissection ( alnd ) has been part of breast cancer surgery since the description of the radical mastectomy.1  story_separator_special_tag a new study finds that many women with early breast cancer do not need a painful procedure that has long been routine : removal of cancerous lymph nodes from the armpit . newline_char surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for 100 years , believing it would prolong women â€™ s lives by keeping the cancer from spreading or coming back . newline_char removing the cancerous lymph nodes proved unnecessary because the women in the study had chemotherapy and radiation , which probably wiped out any disease in the nodes , the researchers said . newline_char those treatments are now standard for women with breast cancer in the lymph nodes , based on the realization that once the disease reaches the nodes , it has the potential to spread to vital organs and can not be eliminated by surgery alone .
