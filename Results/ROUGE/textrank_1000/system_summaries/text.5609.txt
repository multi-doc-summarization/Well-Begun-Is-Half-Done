few days ago microsoft loaned me a prototype samsung tablet running the new os , and i ’ ve found the interface to be just as good as—and in some ways even better than—the ipad ’ s os . newline_char if hardware companies begin making decent tablets to run windows 8 , the new operating system could make for the first worthy rival to apple ’ s unstoppable machine . newline_char while it is optimized for touchscreens , the new os is also meant to run on the billions of laptops and desktops that have long been microsoft ’ s bread and butter . newline_char when you run any program designed for today ’ s windows in the new os , it will show up in the desktop interface . story_separator_special_tag the windows 8 consumer preview is only just becoming available to the public , but we ’ ve had the opportunity to use it for a few days on a samsung slate nearly identical to the one we sampled at the build conference for developers last year . newline_char we know you don ’ t want to wait , so we offer our initial impressions of the release based on several days with a microsoft-provided , samsung-built slate running the same release the public will download . newline_char there ’ s only one major difference : the store is not yet functional , so these impressions are based only on the apps built into the windows 8 consumer preview itself . story_separator_special_tag microsoft made the windows 8 consumer preview available this morning to everyone who wants to check it out . newline_char microsoft says that where the developer build was about emphasizing touch , with the consumer preview ( build 8250 for those scoring at home ) it focused on showing how the mouse and keyboard is just as friendly to metro .
