ano , it was clear form radioactive materials turning up in trace amounts outside the reactors that fuel damage had occurred . newline_char photo a meltdown occurs when there is insufficient cooling of the reactor core , and it is the most dangerous kind of a nuclear power accident because of the risk of radiation releases . newline_char even before the explosion on saturday , officials said they had detected radioactive cesium , which is created when uranium fuel is split , an indication that some of the nuclear fuel in the reactor was already damaged . newline_char how much damage the fuel suffered remained uncertain , though safety officials insisted repeatedly through the day that radiation leaks outside the plant remained small and did not pose a major health risk . newline_char worries about the safety of the two plants worsened on saturday because executives of the company that runs them , tokyo electric power , and government officials gave confusing accounts of the location and causes of the dramatic midday explosion and the damage it caused . story_separator_special_tag vienna radiation leaked from japan 's quake-stricken fukushima daiichi nuclear plant on saturday after a blast blew its roof off . newline_char the government later said radiation levels were low because the explosion had not affected the reactor core container , although it had severely damaged the main building . newline_char " the most probable ( cause of the blast ) is that the coolant , particularly if it 's water , can overheat and turn to steam more rapidly than it was designed to , " said nuclear fuel technology professor timothy abram at manchester university . newline_char " the world nuclear association , a london-based industry body , said the blast was probably due to hydrogen igniting and that this was unlikely to cause a big accident by itself .
