l and water don ’ t mix — so why are there drops of fat in the newest bottle of h2o ? newline_char “ my whole career in silicon valley has been about disruptive technology , ” says dave asprey creator of fatwater and an early cloud computing pioneer . newline_char ( jorg greuel/getty images ) the secret ingredient in fatwater is teeny droplets of fat extracted from coconut oil in asprey ’ s proprietary process . newline_char the oil helps the water do its job better because cells are more likely to take in h2o that has a tiny bit of fat in it , he says . newline_char meanwhile , the fats in the oil provide a temporary energy boost and does not get stored as body fat in the way sugar does , he adds . newline_char “ the oils enhance thermogenesis , which is a fancy word for ‘ fat burning , ’ ” says asprey , 42 . newline_char ( © mario anzuoni / reuters/reuters ) nutritionists at brown & medina in manhattan also questioned fatwater ’ s claims , saying in a statement that the small amount of fat diluted in the water “ would most likely not have an impact on fat burn. story_separator_special_tag courtesy of fatwater the thing : a $ 3.95 bottle of water mixed with fat , a sweetener and some flavors . newline_char asprey says he uses a patented process to take purified water and mix in tiny droplets of “ bulletproof xct oil ” : medium chain triglycerides ( mcts ) derived from coconut oil . newline_char more : bamboo water is now a thing the hype : asprey says fatwater is more hydrating than plain water because the nanoparticles of fat “ bring the water into the cells more effectively.
