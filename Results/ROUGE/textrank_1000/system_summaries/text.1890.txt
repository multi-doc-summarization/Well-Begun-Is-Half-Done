tor george takei took to his facebook page thursday night to explain what he meant by calling supreme court justice clarence thomas a “ clown in blackface , ” saying the term was “ theater lingo ” that “ is not racist. newline_char ” a few fans have written wondering whether i intended to utter a racist remark by referring to justice thomas as a “ clown in blackface. newline_char ” “ blackface ” is a lesser known theatrical term for a white actor who blackens his face to play a black buffoon . newline_char in traditional theater lingo , and in my view and intent , that is not racist . newline_char i feel justice thomas has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings . newline_char no , no one cared if you “ intended to utter a racist remark. newline_char ” they cared that you uttered a racist remark . newline_char the people who took offense to your comments knew exactly what blackface is , and the entire ugly racist history behind it . newline_char so blackface “ is not racist , ” but “ is instead part of a racist history in this country. newline_char “ i feel justice thomas has abdicated and abandoned his african american heritage… ” let ’ s pause you right there . newline_char what sort of discourse will this country have when people are told that unless they toe the line on certain beliefs , they will be considered traitors to their race and hollywood actors can shame them without facing any sort of retribution at all ? newline_char ” takei had several hours to look up and read thomas ’ dissent to know that he was intentionally taken out of context .
