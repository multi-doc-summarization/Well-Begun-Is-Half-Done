stract background : nut intake has been associated with lower mortality , but few studies have investigated causes of death other than cardiovascular disease , and dose-response relationships remain unclear . newline_char methods : we investigated the relationship of nut ( tree nut , peanut ) and peanut butter intake with overall and cause-specific mortality . newline_char results : total nut intake was related to lower overall and cause-specific mortality ( cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular , respiratory , neurodegenerative diseases , other causes ) in men and women . newline_char conclusions : nut intake was related to lower overall and cause-specific mortality , with evidence for nonlinear dose-response relationships . story_separator_special_tag bad ones include industrial-made trans fats . newline_char all fats have a similar chemical structure : a chain of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms . newline_char trans fats have no known health benefits and that there is no safe level of consumption . story_separator_special_tag daily consumption of nuts and peanuts linked to lower mortality rates 11 june 2015 nuts and peanuts , but not peanut butter , may protect against death from cancer , heart disease , respiratory disease and other major causes , new study finds a paper published today in the international journal of epidemiology confirms a link between peanut and nut intake and lower mortality rates , but finds no protective effect for peanut butter . newline_char men and women who eat at least 10 grams of nuts or peanuts per day have a lower risk of dying from several major causes of death than people who do n't consume nuts or peanuts . newline_char however , in this new study , it was found that mortality due to cancer , diabetes , respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases was also lowered among users of peanuts and nuts .
