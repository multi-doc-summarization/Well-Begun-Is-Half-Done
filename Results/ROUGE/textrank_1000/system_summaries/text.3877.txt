tory_separator_special_tag the study found that , in the presence of vitamin b12 , the skin bacteria that are commonly linked to acne start pumping out inflammatory molecules known to promote pimples . newline_char the researchers looked at the bacteria 's gene expression , hoping to figure out why propionibacterium acnes , which is the most common skin microbe , causes pimples in some people but not in others . newline_char they found that vitamin b12 changed the gene expression of the skin bacteria , which could have led to acne-promoting inflammation . story_separator_special_tag vitamin b12 alters how the genes of facial bacteria behave — a change that in turn promotes inflammation , which has been linked to pimples in the past . newline_char scientists have shown that the production of sebum — the oily , waxy stuff your skin makes — and a disorder of the cells that line the inside of hair follicles are both involved in acne development , but the role of bacteria in those pimples we all dread still holds some mysteries . story_separator_special_tag but it turns out that vitamin b12 could be causing acne , the skin disorder that results in spots , pimples and blackheads , scientists have found . newline_char a new study has found that the vitamin changes the way bacteria behave on the skin of susceptible people . newline_char the discovery could lead to new treatments for the distressing skin disorder , and shed light on why some people who take vitamin b12 supplements come out in spots . newline_char researchers led by dr huiyang li , from the university of california , los angeles , write in the journal science translational medicine : " our findings suggest a new bacterial pathogenesis pathway in acne and provide one molecular explanation for the long-standing clinical observation that vitamin b12 supplementation leads to acne development in a subset of individuals .
