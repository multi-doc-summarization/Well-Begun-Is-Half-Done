zi ( inset photo ) , a stone age man who died atop a glacier about 5300 years ago , suffered from severe gum disease and cavities . story_separator_special_tag earlier research analyzed ötzi 's mitochondrial dna , which is inherited through only the female line , but had found few known matches among modern populations . newline_char now sequencing of his y chromosome places him in the rare g2a4 haplogroup , meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the near east for europe at the beginning of the neolithic era , roughly 1000 years before ötzi himself lived . newline_char ötzi 's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of sardinia and corsica , as well as some of the more remote areas of georgia and russia , says geneticist angela graefen of the institute for mummies and the iceman in bolzano , italy , one of the principal researchers on the paper . newline_char that does n't mean that ötzi was sardinian or corsican , graefen notes , but that those populations may be the closest living genetic matches to the hunter-gatherers who originally migrated into europe . newline_char the genome analysis , published this week in nature communications , also helps flesh out our picture of ötzi the man : researchers now know he had brown eyes , brown hair , type-o blood , and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among neolithic europeans . newline_char burgdorferi genome from ötzi with more modern incarnations of the pathogen , they wo n't have a clear picture of how lyme disease evolves . newline_char " but depending on the research other scientists are doing over the next few years , we could be gaining a lot more insights from ötzi 's genome , " graefen says .
