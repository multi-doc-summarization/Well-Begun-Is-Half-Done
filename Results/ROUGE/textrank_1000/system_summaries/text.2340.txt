shington ( reuters ) - some 200,000 salvadoran immigrants allowed to live and work in the united states since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019 , officials said on monday , marking the trump administration ’ s latest move to tighten immigration enforcement . newline_char the decision to end tps for salvadorans is part of the administration ’ s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the united states illegally . newline_char the move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in el salvador and gave the salvadorans few options but to leave the united states or remain illegally . newline_char the trump administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in the united states whose home countries have been affected by disasters . newline_char salvadorans are by far the largest group under tps , a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims , not a permanent right to remain in the united states . newline_char trump administration changes to the tps program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in the united states will be subject to deportation if they remain . newline_char reuters/jose cabezas “ the past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in the united states long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the ‘ temporary ’ protected status a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration , ” said roy beck , president of numbersusa , which favors less immigration overall . story_separator_special_tag
