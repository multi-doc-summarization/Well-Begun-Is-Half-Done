ris ( reuters ) - a cloud of radioactive pollution over europe in recent weeks indicates that an accident has happened in a nuclear facility in russia or kazakhstan in the last week of september , french nuclear safety institute irsn said on thursday . newline_char reuters/yuri maltsev the irsn ruled out an accident in a nuclear reactor , saying it was likely to be in a nuclear fuel treatment site or center for radioactive medicine . newline_char irsn , the technical arm of french nuclear regulator asn , said in a statement it could not pinpoint the location of the release of radioactive material but that based on weather patterns , the most plausible zone lay south of the ural mountains , between the urals and the volga river . newline_char peres said that in recent weeks irsn and several other nuclear safety institutes in europe had measured high levels of levels of ruthenium 106 , a radioactive nuclide that is the product of splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor and which does not occur naturally . newline_char the ruthenium 106 was probably released in a nuclear fuel treatment site or center for radioactive medicine , peres said . newline_char measurement from european stations showed high levels of ruthenium 106 in the atmosphere of the majority of european countries , at the beginning of october , with a steady decrease from oct. story_separator_special_tag the results obtained for sampling periods later than october 6 , 2017 , showed a steady decrease in ruthenium 106 levels , which is currently no longer detected in europe . newline_char based on the meteorological conditions provided by météo france and the measurement results available in european countries , irsn carried out simulations to locate the release zone , to assess the quantity of ruthenium released , as well as the period and the duration of the release .
