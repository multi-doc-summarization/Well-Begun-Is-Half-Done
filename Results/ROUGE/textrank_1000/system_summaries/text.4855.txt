ndon genes that increase the risk of a person developing schizophrenia may also increase the chance they will use cannabis , researchers said on tuesday after studying more than 1,000 users of the drug . newline_char the results chime with previous studies linking schizophrenia and cannabis , but suggest the association may be due to common genes and might not be a causal relationship where cannabis use leads to increased schizophrenia risk . newline_char our study certainly does not rule this out , but it suggests that there is likely to be an association in the other direction as well – that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use , " said robert power , who led the study at the institute of psychiatry at king 's college london . newline_char the researchers found that people genetically predisposed to schizophrenia were more likely to use cannabis , and to use it in greater amounts than those who had no schizophrenia risk genes . story_separator_special_tag the resulting studies suggest that the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia might also put people affected by the disorder at increased risk for smoking pot . newline_char this , researchers say , demonstrates that the causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia might not be clear-cut , and that at least a small part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap , where the same genes that predispose certain people to enjoying weed might also predispose others to developing schizophrenia — or both . newline_char but this study indicates " that people who are at risk for schizophrenia are more likely to use cannabis , and in greater quantities , " he says — which means the causal relationship might actually go both ways . newline_char " but evins does n't think these results rule out previous findings that cannabis use increases a person 's risk for developing schizophrenia .
