ce they sense danger , fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight , rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat , new research shows . newline_char in his lab , dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies , also known as drosophila hydei , are very similar to those of a fighter jet . newline_char more like a plane than a boat “ one of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly , ” dickinson said . newline_char previous research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would , dickinson said , but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would . newline_char “ these flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and , in almost a single wing beat , the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate , ” muijres said in the uw release . newline_char using tech to slow down time uw researchers used three high speed cameras to accurately capture the flies ’ movements in a 20-by-20 centimeter flight arena . story_separator_special_tag scientists who had the insects wing it through two laser beams watched the bugs make hairpin turns at blazing fast speeds , by banking in the same way that fighter jet planes do . newline_char " ] when trying to escape from a threat , the drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that ’ s five times faster than their normal turning speed , according to researchers from the university of washington . newline_char to capture such infinitesimally tiny movements , the scientists had to use high-speed cameras that took 7,500 frames per second -- that ’ s nearly 40 frames for each wing beat .
