w , researchers have made a significant advance toward replacing large pieces of bone in humans by growing a pig ’ s own cells into bone in the lab and then using it to restore a piece of missing jaw . newline_char instead , researchers have been experimenting with ways to grow new facial bone , many of them based on synthetic scaffolds—porous structures shaped like the missing region that can be grafted onto existing bone to encourage the body to rebuild . newline_char but these approaches have involved adding precursor cells or growth factors to the scaffold right before it ’ s implanted and allowing the bone to develop inside the body . newline_char growing new bone in the scaffold for weeks before implanting it could have advantages , says gordana vunjak-novakovic , a biomedical engineer at columbia university and senior author on the new paper . newline_char in the new study , vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues tested that idea in 14 pigs with facial bone damage . newline_char to replace those chunks , the team first crafted scaffolds out of cow leg bone by removing all the living cells to leave behind a porous matrix of minerals and proteins . newline_char these were carved with a tiny computer-guided pin that shaved away material to match 3d images of each pig ’ s jaw , created from a computed tomography scan . newline_char by simply soaking the scaffold in the medium , “ you ’ d get something that looks like m & m candy , ” vunjak-novakovic says : healthy bone cells might coat the outside , but they would n't penetrate to the center . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues have managed to create living bone from stem cells . newline_char then the researchers implanted the new bone in each pig .
