 its thousand or so residents were not all that surprised when , a few years ago , a turkish-born german biopsychologist named onur güntürkün showed up and asked them to participate in a study . newline_char herodotus described communities in ethiopia whose residents “ spoke like bats , ” and reports of the whistled language that is still used in the canary islands date back more than six hundred years . newline_char all are based on spoken languages : kuşköy ’ s version , for example , adapts standard turkish syllables into piercing tones that can be heard from more than half a mile away . newline_char although neuroscientists have long understood that brain functions do not divide cleanly between the left and right hemispheres , the left hemisphere appears to play a consistently dominant role in our understanding of language—regardless of whether the language is tonal or atonal , spoken or written , signed with the hands or clicked with the tongue . newline_char in kuşköy , güntürkün tested this cranial division of labor by recruiting thirty-one volunteers , all fluent in both spoken and whistled turkish , to listen to pairs of different syllables played simultaneously through headphones , one in each ear . newline_char when he gave them spoken turkish , the participants usually understood the syllable played through the right speaker , suggesting that the left hemisphere was processing the sound . newline_char when he switched to whistled turkish , however , the participants understood both syllables in roughly equal measure , suggesting that both hemispheres played significant roles in the early stages of comprehension . newline_char ” he now wonders whether people whose spoken-language comprehension is damaged by a left-hemisphere stroke could learn to understand a whistled dialect , much as some people with stroke-damaged speech can communicate by singing . story_separator_special_tag
