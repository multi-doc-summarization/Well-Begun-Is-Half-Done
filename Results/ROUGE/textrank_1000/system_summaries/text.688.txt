 tend to yawn when we are tired , stressed or under-stimulated , which are all factors that can alter the temperature of the brain , and the university of vienna researchers tested whether air temperature could influence how much we yawn . newline_char they conducted the test in both summer months and winter months to see how air temperature affected their yawning frequency . newline_char yawning frequency reduced when temperatures were around 37°c in arizona 's summer and also in the freezing depths of the vienna winter . newline_char lead author dr jorg massen said yawning appears to be unhelpful when the air temperature is as hot as the body , or when it is freezing , as the cold air is unnecessary or could even be harmful . story_separator_special_tag to test this , jorg massen and kim dusch of the university of vienna measured contagious yawning frequencies of pedestrians outdoors in vienna , austria , during both the winter and summer months , and then compared these results to an identical study conducted earlier in arid climate of arizona , usa . newline_char it turned out that it was not the seasons themselves , nor the amount of daylight hours experienced , but that contagious yawning was constrained to an optimal thermal zone or range of ambient temperatures around 20o c. story_separator_special_tag consequently , yawning should be constrained to an optimal thermal zone or range of temperature , i.e. newline_char previous research shows that yawn frequency diminishes as ambient temperatures rise and approach body temperature , but a lower bound to the thermal window has not been demonstrated . newline_char to test this , a total of 120 pedestrians were sampled for susceptibly to self-reported yawn contagion during distinct temperature ranges and seasons ( winter : 1.4 °c , n = 60 ; summer : 19.4 °c , n = 60 ) . story_separator_special_tag
