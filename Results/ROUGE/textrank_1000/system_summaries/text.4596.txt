wadays , modern non-invasive measures of in vivo brain volume ( magnetic resonance imaging ) make it possible to reliably assess associations with iq . story_separator_special_tag for centuries , scientists have been investigating the link between human brain size and intelligence , with several studies suggesting inconclusively that the bigger the brain , the smarter a person . newline_char in this instance , researchers from austria , the netherlands , and germany compared iq test results to participants ' brain volumes , measured using brain imaging methods over multiple studies . newline_char " although a certain association is observable , brain volume appears to be of only little practical relevance , " said lead researcher jakob pietschnig , from the university of vienna in austria . newline_char " rather , brain structure and integrity appear to be more important as a biological foundation of iq , whilst brain size works as one of many compensatory mechanisms of cognitive functions . story_separator_special_tag an international team of researchers from the universities of vienna ( austria ) , g√∂ttingen ( germany ) , and tilburg ( netherlands ) provides no evidence for a causal role of brain size for iq test performance . newline_char in a meta-analysis of data from more than 8000 participants , they show that associations between in-vivo brain volume and iq are small . newline_char " the presently observed association means that brain volume plays only a minor role in explaining iq test performance in humans . newline_char although a certain association is observable , brain volume appears to be of only little practical relevance . newline_char rather , brain structure and integrity appear to be more important as a biological foundation of iq , whilst brain size works as one of many compensatory mechanisms of cognitive functions " , explains jakob pietschnig from the institute of applied psychology of the university of vienna .
