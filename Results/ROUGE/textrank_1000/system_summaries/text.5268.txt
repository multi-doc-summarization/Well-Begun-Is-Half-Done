e us fish and wildlife service yesterday proposed that the oregon chub , a small minnow native to oregon 's willamette valley , be removed from the endangered species list created by the 1973 us endangered species act . newline_char the oregon chub was placed on the endangered species in 1993 after the loss of floodplain habitats and predation by non-native fish . newline_char a recovery plan to boost chub numbers was finalized in 1998 , and thanks to the success of methods such as habitat restoration , education , and careful monitoring , the species was reclassified as " threatened " in 2010 . newline_char oregon chub numbers now exceed 150,000 , across 80 different sites if the oregon chub is removed from the us endangered species list , it will join 26 animals , including the steller sea lion and gray wolf , that have had their populations re-grow following their classification as endangered . story_separator_special_tag fish and wildlife service announced tuesday that it was proposing that the oregon chub was recovered , 21 years after it went on the endangered species list . newline_char unlike pacific salmon , the oregon chub was relatively easy to save because it inhabits small places and does not get in the way of huge economic forces , such as logging , hydroelectric power and farming , said oregon department of fish and wildlife biologist brian bangs , who since 2005 has supervised recovery efforts . newline_char joe moll , executive director of the mckenzie river trust , said the chub 's obscurity made it easier to find solutions because there were none of the high stakes and big egos involved in charismatic species like wolves , grizzly bears and salmon . newline_char before european settlement , the willamette valley was a complex system of braided river channels , oxbows and beaver ponds , where perhaps as many as 1 million oregon chub lived , bangs said .
