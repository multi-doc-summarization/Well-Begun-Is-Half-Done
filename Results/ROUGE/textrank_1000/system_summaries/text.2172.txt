perimental compound reverses down syndrome-like learning deficits in mice contact information available for logged-in reporters only citations science translational medicine ; r01 hd38384 ; mh51106 ; r01 ns39156 newswise — researchers at johns hopkins and the national institutes of health have identified a compound that dramatically bolsters learning and memory when given to mice with a down syndrome-like condition on the day of birth . newline_char the scientists caution that use of the compound , a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist , has not been proven safe to try in people with down syndrome , but say their experiments hold promise for developing drugs like it . newline_char as a result of this “ trisomy , ” people with down syndrome have extra copies of the more than 300 genes housed on that chromosome , which leads to intellectual disabilities , distinctive facial features and sometimes heart problems and other health effects . story_separator_special_tag there is no cure for down syndrome , which is caused by the presence of an additional chromosome , leading to extra copies of more than 300 genes and causing intellectual disabilities , distinctive facial features and sometimes other health problems . newline_char the team at johns hopkins university used lab mice that were genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half the genes found on human chromosome 21 , leading to down syndrome-like conditions such as smaller brains and difficulty learning to navigate a maze . newline_char on the day the mice were born , scientists injected them with a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist . story_separator_special_tag " in the experiment , the researchers used mice that were genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half of the genes found on human chromosome 21 .
