cording to a fascinating new study led by columbia ’ s earth institute and published today the journal the cryosphere , which finds that greenland ’ s “ albedo , ” or reflectivity , has been decreasing since the mid 90s . story_separator_special_tag the surface energy balance and meltwater production of the greenland ice sheet ( gris ) are modulated by snow and ice albedo through the amount of absorbed solar radiation . story_separator_special_tag greenland 's ice is getting darker , increasing risk of melting feedback loops from melting itself are driving changes in reflectivity greenland 's snowy surface has been getting darker over the past two decades , absorbing more heat from the sun and increasing snow melt , a new study of satellite data shows . newline_char " you do n't necessarily have to have a 'dirtier ' snowpack to make it dark , " said lead author marco tedesco , a research professor at columbia university 's lamont-doherty earth observatory and adjunct scientist at nasa goddard institute of space studies . story_separator_special_tag in a study that used satellite images stretching back decades , scientists have delved into the processes causing 'darkening ' of the greenland ice sheet – its diminishing ability to reflect the sun 's radiation . newline_char greenland ’ s ice sheet has been darkening for the past two decades , and new research delves into the processes behind this phenomenon . newline_char the study , published thursday in the cryosphere , a journal of the european geosciences union , considers the processes by which an ice sheet loses its ability to reflect sunlight – its albedo – terming this diminishing capability as “ darkening.
