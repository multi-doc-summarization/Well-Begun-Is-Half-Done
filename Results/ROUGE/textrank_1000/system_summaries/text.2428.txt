o years ago , ellen martinsen , was collecting mosquitoes at the smithsonian 's national zoo , looking for malaria that might infect birds -- when she discovered something strange : a dna profile , from parasites in the mosquitoes , that she could n't identify . newline_char by chance , she had discovered a malaria parasite , plasmodium odocoilei -- that infects white-tailed deer . newline_char martinsen and her colleagues estimate that the parasite infects up to twenty-five percent of white-tailed deer along the east coast of the united states . newline_char " the new study , led by martinsen , was a collaboration with scientists at the smithsonian conservation biology institute , the american museum of natural history , the national park service , the university of georgia , the university of wisconsin-milwaukee -- and uvm biologist and malaria expert joseph schall . newline_char though martinsen and schall are quick to note that they anticipate little danger to people from this newly discovered deer malaria , it does underline the fact that many human health concerns are connected to wider ecological systems -- and that understanding the biology of other species is a foundation to both conservation and public health management . newline_char but now martinsen and her colleagues have discovered that the deer malaria is widespread -- though it 's " cryptic " she says , because the parasites occur in very low levels in many of the infected deer . story_separator_special_tag north america â€™ s most popular game species , the white-tailed deer , harbors a secret : low levels of a malaria parasite that have only now been detected thanks to advanced dna technology . newline_char the study marks the first finding of a malaria parasite species of mammals that is native to the americas .
