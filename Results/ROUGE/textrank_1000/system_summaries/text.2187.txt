 understand this aspect of the water-to-land transition , we surveyed the latimeria genome annotations to identify genes that were present in the last common ancestor of all bony fish ( including the coelacanth ) but that are missing from tetrapod genomes . newline_char previous studies of genes that were lost in this transition could only compare teleost fish to tetrapods , meaning that differences in gene content could have been due to loss in the tetrapod or in the lobe-finned fish lineages . newline_char as vertebrates transitioned to a new land environment , changes occurred not only in gene content but also in the regulation of existing genes . story_separator_special_tag in the hope of reconstructing a pivotal step in evolution — the colonization of land by fish that learned to walk and breathe air — researchers have decoded the genome of the coelacanth , a prehistoric-looking fish whose form closely resembles those seen in the fossils of 400 million years ago . newline_char the coelacanth has fleshy , lobed fins that look somewhat like limbs , as does the lungfish , an air-breathing freshwater fish . newline_char the coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods , meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants , from reptiles and birds to mammals . newline_char the coelacanth genome is therefore more likely to shed light on the central evolutionary question of what genetic alterations were needed to change a lobe-finned fish into the first land-dwelling tetrapod . newline_char amemiya ’ s team has sifted through the coelacanth ’ s genome for genes that might have helped its cousin species , the ancestor to the first tetrapod , invade dry land some 400 million years ago .
