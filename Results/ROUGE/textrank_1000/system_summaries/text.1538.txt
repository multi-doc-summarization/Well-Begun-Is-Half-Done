tory_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag key points : babylonians approach to calculating triangles using simple ratios much more straightforward than our current methods discovery has the potential to make maths education easier for teachers and students " it 's rare the ancient world teaches us something new " , mathematician says daniel mansfield from university of new south wales said the palm-sized tablet , covered in rows of tiny numbers in angular cuneiform script , simplifies the study of triangles from using angles and irrational numbers to simple ratios . newline_char in 1945 , mathematicians noticed it contained pythagoras ' theorem — named after the ancient greek mathematician who actually lived more than 1,000 years after the tablet was made — which shows the square of the side opposite the right angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides . story_separator_special_tag dating from 1,000 years before pythagoras ’ s theorem , the babylonian clay tablet is a trigonometric table more accurate than any today , say researchers at least 1,000 years before the greek mathematician pythagoras looked at a right angled triangle and worked out that the square of the longest side is always equal to the sum of the squares of the other two , an unknown babylonian genius took a clay tablet and a reed pen and marked out not just the same theorem , but a series of trigonometry tables which scientists claim are more accurate than any available today . newline_char the team from the university of new south wales in sydney believe that the four columns and 15 rows of cuneiform – wedge shaped indentations made in the wet clay – represent the world ’ s oldest and most accurate working trigonometric table , a working tool which could have been used in surveying , and in calculating how to construct temples , palaces and pyramids .
