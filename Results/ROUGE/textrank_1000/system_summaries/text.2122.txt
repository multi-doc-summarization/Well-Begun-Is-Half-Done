 ) in the journal of experimental biology , show that the southeast asian snake 's flattened , ufo-like cross-section gives it the right aerodynamic properties for gliding . newline_char while birds , and even humans using glider wings , are much better at their airborne maneuvers , the snake 's performance compares favorably to that of other gliding animals , such as flying squirrels , lizards and even ants , socha said . newline_char no snake-shaped planes to answer one part of the puzzle , the team created physical models of the cross-section and tested them in a water tunnel , which , if set up properly , can have the same flow characteristics as air , socha said . newline_char compared to a more familiar flying shape , such as an airplane wing scaled down to snake size , " you 'd find the snake is actually comparable , " socha said . newline_char but do n't expect to board a 747 with flying-snake-shaped wings anytime soon , as the shape would n't be nearly as aerodynamically effective at a plane 's size and speed , socha said . story_separator_special_tag choi snakes don ’ t need to be on a plane to fly : five species of the gliding reptiles can soar as far as 100 feet ( 30 meters ) in the tropical rain forests of southeast asia . newline_char ” ) the researchers printed a 3-d rod with a ufo-like cross section that mimicked the body of the paradise tree snake ( chrysopelea paradisi ) , the most proficient snake glider . newline_char ) the researchers added that real flying snakes appear to glide even better than their findings from the 3-d printed model would suggest .
