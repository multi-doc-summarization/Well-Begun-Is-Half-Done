oud posted a controversial sign monday morning . newline_char the sign outside treats family restaurant in lonsdale , minnesota , reads “ muslims get out. newline_char restaurant owner dan ruedinger says the sign has led to some backlash , but he says business is up so much that he had to call in three extra workers monday . newline_char “ it ’ s time that people started standing up , not worrying about the pc crowd and do what is right , ” ruedinger said . newline_char it ’ s my right and i ’ m going to stand up , and i wish more people would do it. newline_char “ but that ’ s giving lonsdale a bad rap to everyone that drives by on 19 , which is a very busy road , so people are going to see that and they ’ re going to think lonsdale as a whole , as a community , is as crass as that sign. story_separator_special_tag lonsdale , mn ( 55046 ) today partly cloudy skies early will give way to cloudy skies late . story_separator_special_tag they claim the burgers are hand made , not frozen , and i 'm sure that may be true ... newline_char something is n't quite right there , maybe it 's just really bad soda . newline_char what keeps me from going back at all even for the decent ice cream is the service , frankly . newline_char most importantly , if there 's more than one person in the restaurant , it can also take a long time to be served or for your food to be made . newline_char i believe the owner delivers the food locally as well , but you 'd have to call and ask if that 's still the case .
