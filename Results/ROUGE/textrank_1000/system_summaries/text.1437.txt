rizon plunges down the biggest rabbit-hole in history in search of the smallest thing in the universe . story_separator_special_tag one contender for the smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole . newline_char these too , seemed like fundamental particles , before scientists discovered that protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each . newline_char " and even if quarks and electrons are indivisible , parker said , scientists do n't know if they are the smallest bits of matter in existence , or if the universe contains objects that are even more minute . newline_char the theory posits that all particles , instead of being point-like , are actually little loops of string . newline_char in that case , two particles would n't be able to come infinitely close to each other because they would always have to be separated by the minimum size of a grain of space . newline_char a singularity another contender for the title of smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole . newline_char black holes are formed when matter is condensed in a small enough space that gravity takes over , causing the matter to pull inward and inward , ultimately condensing into a single point of infinite density . newline_char " my guess is that [ black hole singularities ] are quite a lot smaller than a quark , but i do n't believe they 're of infinite density , " parker told livescience . newline_char " it corresponds to the distance where the gravitational field is so strong that it can start to do things like make black holes out of the energy of the field , " parker said . newline_char " perhaps all of the universe 's smallest things are roughly the size of the planck length .
