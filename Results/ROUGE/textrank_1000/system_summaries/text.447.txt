t i think hashtag activism should be used judiciously , especially when it comes to issues affecting the black community , at home and abroad . newline_char that 's why , after a few tweets , i ceased participating in the ongoing # bringbackourgirls campaign , which is designed to highlight the plight of more than 200 nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by boko haram last month . newline_char the campaign has been going on for weeks , and it 's become painfully clear that while the hashtag has elicited attention , the news coverage is n't enough to make a difference to the people at the center of this horrifying story—the nigerian girls who have not been brought back and who , despite all of the tweets , remain in grave danger . newline_char in fact , by the time the celebrity attention and major media outlets got on board , more than two weeks had passed since the girls were abducted . newline_char social media activism might not be as powerful as many think it is when it comes to tangible results , when we 're dealing with situations that call for more than just raising awareness . story_separator_special_tag these ‘ islamic ’ militants have razed entire villages to the ground , hacked men to death and killed children as they slept , but now the west has a hashtag campaign . newline_char # bringbackourgirls has exploded across social media , powered by a desire to reunite 200 kidnapped nigerian girls with their parents as well as a strong sense of outrage . newline_char it can be a brilliant way to bring a campaign to people 's attention , but presumably those using the hashtag # bringbackourgirls want to do more than just spread awareness-they want those girls brought home .
