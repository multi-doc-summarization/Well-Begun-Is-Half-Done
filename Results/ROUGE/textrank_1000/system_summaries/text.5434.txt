stract we measured maps of atmospheric water ( h 2 o ) and its deuterated form ( hdo ) across the martian globe , showing strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high d/h enrichment indicative of great water loss . newline_char our atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 vsmow , which would mean that early mars ( 4.5 billion years ago ) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep . story_separator_special_tag a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold , nasa scientists say . newline_char on mars , water containing normal hydrogen is lost to space over time , but the heavier form is left behind . story_separator_special_tag view images originally earth and mars had identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water . newline_char photograph by nasa astronomers using some of the world 's most powerful telescopes have determined that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the martian surface four billion years ago . newline_char a team of scientists led by geronimo villanueva , of nasa 's goddard space flight center , took a series of measurements of sunlight reflecting off the martian surface and through the atmosphere , which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere 's vapor . newline_char an ancient sea once covered a fifth of the planet ’ s surface , astronomers found by calculating how much water the planet has lost over time . newline_char both earth and mars started out with identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water . newline_char as a result , mars now has a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than earth does—seven times as high , in fact .
