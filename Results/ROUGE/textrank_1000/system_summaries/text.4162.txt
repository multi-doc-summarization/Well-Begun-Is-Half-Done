e way that tesla envisions it working is that the car detects the driver 's intent to change lanes or make a turn by using the autopilot hardware at its disposal , it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them , it puts the signal on for the driver . newline_char if it works , it will be brilliant but given the fact that tesla has remained adamant that it does n't need driver monitoring systems for autopilot , it seems questionable that the vehicle would be able to detect a driver 's intent to turn based solely on external observation . newline_char there are plenty of systems out now from other manufacturers that will offer drivers a warning to use their signals after repeated turns or lane changes without them , but because those ultimately rely on the driver moving their finger and physically activating the signal , they 're not that helpful . story_separator_special_tag surprisingly , it sounds like the technology is actually not for self-driving cars , but for drivers who forget/don ’ t use turn signals . newline_char by leveraging its autopilot technology , the automaker thinks it can detect when a driver should activate its turn signal and do it for them if they forget it . newline_char here ’ s the full patent application : electrek ’ s take it sounds like tesla might have been working on detecting when it should activate its turn signal when the vehicle is driving automatically and figured out that it could also be useful technology when drivers are manually driving their vehicles . newline_char currently , tesla drivers can initiate a lane change on autopilot but they have to make sure the way is clear and activate the turn signal – only then will autopilot drive the car in the next lane .
