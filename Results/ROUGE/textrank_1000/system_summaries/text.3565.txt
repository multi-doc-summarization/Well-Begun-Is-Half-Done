wever this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us , as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers , and we know there were some operational issues with it . story_separator_special_tag tammar wallaby young spend nine months in their mother 's pouch researchers have laid bare the dna of a kangaroo species for the first time . newline_char an international team of scientists , writing in the biomed central journal , genome biology , say they have even indentified a gene responsible for the kangaroo 's hop . newline_char the tammar wallaby ( macropus eugenii ) is only the third marsupial to have its genome sequenced . newline_char the team says the first kangaroo genome is a milestone in the study of mammalian evolution . newline_char the ancestors of kangaroos and other marsupials diverged from other mammals at least 130 million years ago . newline_char professor marilyn renfree of the university of melbourne , a lead researcher on the project , said : " the tammar wallaby sequencing project has provided us with many possibilities for understanding how marsupials are different from us . newline_char " key marsupial traits dr elizabeth murchison , a marsupial specialist at the wellcome trust sanger institute in cambridge , uk , described the study as " a wonderful tool for studying the evolution of marsupials , and mammals in general , and an impressive piece of work looking at one of australia 's iconic species . newline_char this is only the third marsupial genome to be sequenced dr murchison told bbc news : " it 's always really valuable to look at an organism that is a bit different to understand how humans and other mammals have evolved . newline_char " it gives you a perspective on mammalian evolution by looking at mammals that have diverged fairly early on , like the kangaroo .
