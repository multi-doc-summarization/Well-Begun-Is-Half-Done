tory_separator_special_tag there would be no lumos – the charity dedicated to closing child institutions and so-called orphanages – if there hadn ’ t first been this picture . newline_char the sad truth remains that my instinctive reaction to that picture could stand as a metaphor for the attitude that has enabled the unjustifiable incarceration of 8 million children around this world to take place with little outrage or comment . newline_char it told of a nightmarish institution where children as young as six were caged most of the day and night . newline_char part of our work in lumos is to shed light on the lives of those millions of children separated from their families for reasons of poverty , disability and discrimination . newline_char most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them , or because of a lack of local education and health facilities , especially for children with special needs . newline_char the idea of any child being taken from their family and locked away , all too often in atrocious conditions , is particularly poignant at this time of year . newline_char cut off from society , institutionalised children return to the world with their chances of a happy , healthy life greatly impaired , often unable to find employment , excluded from the community and more likely to enter into a lifetime of poverty and dependency . newline_char where there is investment in inclusive education and health , where vulnerable families receive support for poverty , employment and social and medical problems ; where there are fostering , adoption or other family-based care alternatives for children who can not be with their parents ; and where the culture of institutionalisation is replaced by one that prioritises keeping families together , children can thrive within their own families and communities .
