guably the world ’ s most famous painting , da vinci 's mona lisa has now been copied onto the world ’ s smallest canvas at the georgia institute of technology . newline_char associate professor jennifer curtis ' " mini lisa " is one-third the width of a human hair , with details as small as one-eighth of a micron . newline_char mini lisa demonstrates the flexibility of a new nanolithography technique that can vary the surface concentration of molecules on very small portions of a substrate . newline_char “ by tuning the temperature , our team manipulated chemical reactions to yield variations in the molecular concentrations on the nanoscale , ” said jennifer curtis , an associate professor in the school of physics and the study ’ s lead author . story_separator_special_tag researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created a reproduction of the 'mona lisa ' that is no wider than a third of the width of a human hair . newline_char georgia tech researchers have created the " mini lisa " on a substrate surface approximately 30 microns in width . newline_char using a microscopic cantilever , an anchored beam with a tiny , downward-facing point at one end , a patient georgia tech doctoral candidate named keith carroll , heated tiny spots on a surface to create a series of chemical reactions to create new molecules : the more heat mr. newline_char their efforts were more than just an attempt to create a nanoscale artistic movement : “ we envision tcnl will be capable of patterning gradients of other physical or chemical properties , such as conductivity of graphene , ” said georgia tech physics professor jennifer curtis , the study 's lead author , in a press release .
