gadget does n't cite a specific person or anonymous source , but says it , " received hard evidence from within b & n ; that the nook is being discontinued , with sales to seemingly continue until stock is exhausted . newline_char " the " outfit " ( we assume that means barnes & noble ) is apparently " encouraging retail partners to not send out any 'bulk requests ' for the nook 3g , as there simply 'will not be sufficient quantities to fulfill those orders . newline_char " as we said , it 's a little hard to decipher what this means , but we should point out that engadget 's story about the nook color getting an update to android 2.2 and possibly blowing up if you rooted it ( installed custom android firmware ) ended up being just a tad off base . newline_char one thing worth pointing out is that it would seem odd for barnes & noble to discontinue the 3g/wi-fi version of the nook and tell customers they could only get the wi-fi-only version . newline_char while barnes & noble remains heavily focused on marketing the nook color , the more likely scenario is for the company to refresh the nook e-ink line , which launched in november 2009 . newline_char in any case , we think that barnes & noble will continue to offer some sort of sub- $ 200 3g-enabled nook as long as amazon is offering one . newline_char we have no " hard evidence " to prove some change is coming to the nook line , and barnes & noble does n't comment on rumors . story_separator_special_tag despite barnes & noble 's nook product line showing all-time sales highs ( thanks in no small part to the uber-popular nook color ) , the e-ink nook 3g is apparently about to be discontinued , according to an engadget tipster .
