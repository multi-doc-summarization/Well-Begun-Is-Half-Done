e new research seeks to answer that last question : was our water made before the sun existed , brewed in the same cloud of dust from which the sun would form ? newline_char to find out if the water from that dust cloud made it to earth , researchers measured the ratio of deuterium , or heavy hydrogen to hydrogen . newline_char that means that some of our water must predate the sun , when heavy hydrogen was in abundance . newline_char so , if water can survive a star ’ s birthing process , and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did , that means that water might be a common ingredient in the making of other planets far from our own . newline_char “ by identifying the ancient heritage of earth ’ s water , we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique , and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water , ” said tim harries , a professor at the university of exeter ’ s physics and astronomy department , in england , and an author of the paper , in a statement . newline_char “ consequently , ” he said , “ it raises the possibility that some exoplanets could house the right conditions , and water resources , for life to evolve. newline_char ” last spring , scientists announced that there could be up to 11 billion exoplanets — planets outside or solar system — that are at just the right distance from their stars to have liquid water , and , perhaps , life as well . story_separator_special_tag over the past several decades , researchers have come up with two possible — and competing — explanations of how this heavy water took up residence in our solar system .
