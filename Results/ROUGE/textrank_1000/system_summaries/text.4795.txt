ittka ’ s team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward , but they can also learn this trick from other bees , even though they have no experience with such a task in nature . newline_char the study “ successfully challenges the notion that 'big brains ' are necessary " for new skills to spread , says christian rutz , an evolutionary ecologist who studies bird cognition at the university of st. newline_char the only way the bumble bee could get the sugar water was to pull the flower out from under the table by tugging on the string . story_separator_special_tag conversely , after 48 h of extensive training ( 20 instances of string pulling ) , 11 of the 15 foragers solved the task without feedback from the moving blue flower ( s5 video ) . newline_char in fact , experienced bees may not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward . newline_char to test this prediction , we challenged bees ( colony 2 ) to access the reward when a string was attached to only a colorless inverted eppendorf cap containing sucrose solution ( materials and methods ) immediately after their initial stepwise training and then again after extensive experience with blue flowers and strings . story_separator_special_tag scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward , and then those bees spread the learned technique to others . newline_char a study reported in the journal plos biology on tuesday , for instance , takes bee smarts in a surprising direction : scientists from the queen mary university of london suggest that the “ insects possess the essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission , ” as they wrote in their new paper .
