 you may know , on late sunday evening , while riding the train in oakland , a white man targeted two young black women on the train , without ever saying a word to them , and killed one – a beautiful young soul named nia wilson , an 18 year old high school student , and critically injured her sister – stabbing and slashing them both with a knife – then simply walking away . newline_char i spent all day yesterday doing everything i could to make this story into national news and was prepared this morning to come on and talk about how we needed to work harder to find nia ’ s killer , but i am glad to report that at about 6pm west coast time , john lee cowell , a brutal man with a history of violence across his entire life , was arrested and charged with nia ’ s murder . newline_char first , a local news station in the bay area shared an image of nia holding what looked like a gun . story_separator_special_tag viewers of local oakland news station ktvu are expressing outrage after the station used a photo of slain teen nia wilson holding what appears to be a gun during a broadcast about her murder . newline_char pic.twitter.com/myq7p2gvbw — brotha b ( @ blakedontcrack ) july 23 , 2018 everyone please call @ ktvu and demand that they issue an apology for this shameful coverage , two young black women victims of white terrorism and this is how they choose to depict them ? newline_char — nia ( @ notoriouslynia ) july 23 , 2018 dear @ ktvu , what was the reasoning behind showing this photo of murdered # niawilson ? story_separator_special_tag
