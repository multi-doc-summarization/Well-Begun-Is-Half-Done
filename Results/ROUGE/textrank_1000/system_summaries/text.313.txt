nneapolis -- the 2014 all-star game was one big love poem to derek jeter , and national league starting pitcher adam wainwright did more than any other player on the premises to advance the feel-good storyline . newline_char before throwing a pitch , adam wainwright put his glove on the rubber and stepped back to let derek jeter have a moment . newline_char rob carr/getty images shortly after giving up an opposite-field double to jeter , a triple to mike trout and a home run to miguel cabrera that helped propel the american league to a 5-3 victory over the national league , wainwright inadvertently stepped in it big-time . newline_char " if i 'm going to get taken to the slaughterhouse for saying a stupid phrase , then i deserve it , " wainwright said . newline_char " for all the mixed messages and confusion that wainwright elicited tuesday , he probably did major league baseball a favor by exposing the massive problems inherent with what the all-star game has become in recent years . newline_char it has been 11 years since mlb began awarding home-field advantage in the world series to the al or nl team based on the outcome of the all-star game , and selig maintains that the system has achieved its purpose by elevating a quaint midsummer exhibition into must-see summer viewing . newline_char and as selig is fond of saying , the old system of alternating home-field advantage between leagues from one year to the next was n't exactly " einstein 's theory of relativity . newline_char " after putting derek jeter on base , it was n't long before adam wainwright had reason to regret it . newline_char and while this might seem sacrilegious , you can debate whether jeter should have even been playing in the all-star game this year if it were strictly about winning .
