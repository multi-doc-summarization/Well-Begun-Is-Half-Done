e taste of beer , without its alcoholic effects , may be enough to trigger the release of the pleasure chemical dopamine in the brain , a study finds . newline_char after a taste of beer , the men 's brains showed a notable release of dopamine , a brain chemical associated with the pleasurable experience of consuming alcohol and other drugs . newline_char " we believe this is the first experiment in humans to show that the taste of an alcoholic drink alone , without any intoxicating effect from the alcohol , can elicit this dopamine activity in the brain 's reward centers , " the study 's senior author , neuroscientist david kareken of the indiana university school of medicine , said in a statement . newline_char to study the effect of beer 's taste on dopamine receptors , the researchers scanned the volunteers ' brains using positron emission tomography , which uses the radiation emitted by a radioactive chemical to produce a 3d image of the brain . newline_char the scans revealed higher increases in dopamine after the men tasted beer compared with tasting the sports drink or water — suggesting that the taste of alcohol is enough to prompt a pleasurable response in the brain . newline_char furthermore , the men who had a family history of alcoholism showed an even greater spike in dopamine levels after they tasted the beer , so the dopamine response may be a heritable risk factor for alcoholism . story_separator_special_tag if not , perhaps it ’ s just as well , because scientists say that even the taste of beer ( without the intoxicating effects of alcohol ) can trigger that flow of striatal dopamine in the brain . newline_char the scientists scanned the men ’ s brains during this demure drinking game using positron emission tomography , looking for signs of dopamine release .
