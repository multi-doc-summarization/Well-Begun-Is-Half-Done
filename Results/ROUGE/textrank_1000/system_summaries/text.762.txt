e researchers analyzed mitochondrial dna from 1,633 whales and found low genetic diversity . newline_char yet these social structures now restrict the ability of sperm whales to differentiate and prevent new dna from getting into the stream . newline_char right now , it seems that sperm whale populations are “ shaped by females being ‘ home-bodies ’ —at the social group , regional and oceanic level , ” alexander said in a release . story_separator_special_tag worldwide mtdna diversity is relatively low , but highly structured among geographic regions and social groups , attributed to female philopatry . newline_char however , it is unclear whether this female philopatry is due to geographic regions or social groups , or how this might vary on a worldwide scale . newline_char we found low mtdna diversity ( π = 0.430 % ) reflecting an expansion event < 80 000 years bp , but strong differentiation by ocean , among regions within some oceans , and among social groups . newline_char a hierarchical amova showed that regions were important for explaining mtdna variance in the indian ocean , but not pacific , with social group sampling in the atlantic too limited to include in analyses . newline_char social groups were important in partitioning mtdna and microsatellite variance within both oceans . newline_char therefore , both geographic philopatry and social philopatry influence genetic structure in the sperm whale , but their relative importance differs by sex and ocean , reflecting breeding behaviour , geographic features and perhaps a more recent origin of sperm whales in the pacific . newline_char by investigating the interplay of evolutionary forces operating at different temporal and geographic scales , we show that sperm whales are perhaps a unique example of a worldwide population expansion followed by rapid assortment due to female social organization .
