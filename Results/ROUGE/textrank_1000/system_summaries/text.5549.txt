spite rich genetic and phenotypic diversity [ 4 ] , only a few clones developed , over time , into global commodities—either as dessert bananas , such as the triploid “ cavendish ” clones , or as important staple foods such as cooking bananas and plantains [ 4,5 ] . story_separator_special_tag scientists at wageningen university have demonstrated that the same clone of the fusarium fungus is infecting cavendish bananas in several countries dotted across the globe . newline_char this shows that this fusarium clone , also known as tropical race 4 , is continuing to spread despite the quarantine measures , with disastrous results for banana growers . newline_char one of the fusarium strains is called 'tropical race 4 ' ( tr4 ) and infects many local banana varieties as well as the widely exported cavendish banana , which is very susceptible to this strain . newline_char large areas of banana plantations in countries such as jordan , mozambique , china , the philippines , pakistan and australia are no longer suitable for banana farming , as they have become infested with the panama disease fungus . newline_char dna investigation the researchers at wageningen ur analysed the dna of many fungus specimens from eight countries where the fungus has recently been identified , including jordan , lebanon and pakistan , in order to trace how panama disease has come to spread to different locations across the globe . newline_char gert kema , banana expert at wageningen ur , says : 'this research demonstrates that the quarantine measures and information provided around the globe apparently have not had the desired effect . newline_char that 's why we have to intensify awareness campaigns to reach small and large-scale growers in order to help them with developing and implementing quarantine measures preventing the fungus from continued spreading .
