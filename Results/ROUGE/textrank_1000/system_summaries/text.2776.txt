british biotechnology company called oxitec has genetically engineered a new breed of olive tree fly that could stop their natural counterparts from ravaging olive trees in spain . newline_char the altered flies are implanted with a gene that causes female offspring to die in the larval stage . newline_char the scientists have engineered dengue-carrying mosquitoes around the city of mandacaru to produce offspring that will all die before they can reproduce . newline_char but oxitec ceo hadyn parry says that its method is much more practical and safe than , say , using insecticide . newline_char oxitec 's main focus for now is on the mosquitoes , but they have developed a few more bugs for different purposes , including one that can control populations of cotton-eaters . story_separator_special_tag genetically modified versions of a fly that decimates olive trees could soon be released in spain in an attempt to control the pests . newline_char to tackle this , oxitec , a biotech company based in oxford , uk , has submitted an application to the national biosafety commission in spain to release a small contingent of male gm olive flies , in what would be the first field trial of its kind in europe . newline_char the males are equipped with genes that cause any female offspring they sire to die while they are still in the larval stage , before they have had a chance to reproduce . newline_char the idea is that the male offspring inherit the lethal genes and continue to propagate them through the population , until the number of females dwindles to zero and the species crashes . newline_char the principle is almost the same as with the olive flies â€“ send out an army of male mosquitoes equipped with genes that prevent any offspring , male or female , from reaching breeding age .
