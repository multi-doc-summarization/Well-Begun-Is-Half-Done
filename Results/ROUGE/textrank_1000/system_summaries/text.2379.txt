e alaska senate race wo n't be officially decided until later this month—officials have to go through all the ballots , smoothing out the grizzly-bear tooth-marks and brushing off stray eagle feathers—but as of this morning , it looks like lisa murkowski has accomplished the unlikely feat of being elected as a write-in candidate . newline_char ms murkowski is the incumbent , but lost the republican primary this year to the tea-party candidate joe miller , who is pals with and was heavily promoted by sarah palin . newline_char mrs palin endorsed 60 candidates around the country ; as of now , with a handful of races still uncalled , slightly fewer than half of them won . newline_char and i 'm hesitant to look at endorsements as a measure of influence , because the value of most endorsements is marginal at most ; mary fallin , a republican congresswoman from oklahoma , hardly needed mrs palin 's touch to pick up the governor 's house from the term-limited democrat brad henry . newline_char looking over the year , mrs palin was most effective when she brought a much-needed infusion of money and attention to a lagging candidate early in the process , as with nikki haley in south carolina and christine o'donnell in delaware—but the effects did not always carry through to election day . newline_char on balance , mrs palin undermined her potential credibility by focusing on politics rather than policy , by gambling on a slew of high-profile endorsements ( which kept her on television , at campaign events ) rather than trying to find and nurture a handful of intellectual or philosophical protegees . story_separator_special_tag of the 34 candidates palin endorsed for the house , only 15 won , a less-than-stellar average for someone vying to be the difference-maker in republican politics .
