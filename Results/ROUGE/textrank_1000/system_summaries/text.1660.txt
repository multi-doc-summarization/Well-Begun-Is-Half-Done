w , research suggests that at least some of darwin ’ s famous finches might soon be driven to extinction by parasitic flies introduced to them by humans in the 1960s . newline_char a paper published this week in the journal of applied ecology blames the parasitic nest fly philornis downsi for the threat to geospitza fortis , also known as the medium ground finch . newline_char downsi flies are not themselves parasitic , they lay their eggs in bird nests . newline_char the eggs hatch into maggots , which feed on both brooding adult finches and their babies . newline_char clayton and his team used five years of field data to predict the species ’ long-term viability and found that , in two out of three scenarios , medium ground finches could be gone within the next century . newline_char the team first manipulated the parasite load in actual nests , studying only the medium ground finches , which are the most abundant and have the most accessible nests . story_separator_special_tag an even more compelling mystery concerns a common sight in springtime—bright blue eggs in a robin ’ s nest . newline_char they stand out from both the nest and the parent birds , so why are they bright blue ? newline_char biologists do know that pigment glands in the mother bird ’ s body deposit the blue coloration onto the eggs , so it must have a critical function . newline_char perhaps the dark color camouflages the eggs when the eggs are at the bottom of a dark nest , or the blue might blend in with the sky for some viewers . newline_char some researchers have even speculated that the striking color helps mother birds to find their own eggs . newline_char its egg not only matches the mother bird ’ s coloration , but it also matches the environment .
