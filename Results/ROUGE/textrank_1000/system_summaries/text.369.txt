e numbers suggest the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe , just after the big bang . newline_char " this surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " adam riess , an astronomer with the space telescope science institute and johns hopkins university , said in a news release . story_separator_special_tag according to new research , soon to be published in the astrophysical journal , the rate of expansion , or the hubble constant , is about 73.24 kilometers per second per megaparsec ( a unit equivalent to 3.26 million light-years ) : somewhere between five and nine percent faster than we thought . story_separator_special_tag " this surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and do n't emit light , such as dark energy , dark matter , and dark radiation , " said study leader and nobel laureate adam riess of the space telescope science institute and the johns hopkins university , both in baltimore , maryland . story_separator_special_tag measurements taken by hubble space telescope conflict with studies of radiation left over from big bang – fuelling theories of ‘ dark energy ’ and mystery particles the universe is expanding faster than anyone had previously measured or calculated from theory . newline_char nasa and the european space agency jointly announced the universe is expanding 5 % to 9 % faster than predicted , a finding they reached after using the hubble space telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond themilky way . story_separator_special_tag
