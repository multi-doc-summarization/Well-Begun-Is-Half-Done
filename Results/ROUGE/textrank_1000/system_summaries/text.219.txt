tory_separator_special_tag notes from the field : carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae producing oxa-48-like carbapenemases — united states , 2010–2015 please note : an erratum has been published for this article . newline_char meghan lyman , md1,2 ; maroya walters , phd2 ; david lonsway , mmsc2 ; kamile rasheed , phd2 ; brandi limbago , phd2 ; alexander kallen , md2 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae ( cre ) are bacteria that are often resistant to most classes of antibiotics and cause health care–associated infections with high mortality rates ( 1 ) . newline_char among cre , strains that carry plasmid-encoded carbapenemase enzymes that inactivate carbapenem antibiotics are of greatest public health concern because of their potential for rapid global dissemination , as evidenced by the increasing distribution of cre that produce the klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and the new delhi metallo-β-lactamase . story_separator_special_tag since many oxa-48-like producers do not exhibit resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins , or only decreased susceptibility to carbapenems , their recognition and detection can be challenging . story_separator_special_tag health experts are keeping a close eye on a type of antibiotic-resistant bacteria called cre that , while still rare , has the potential to become more widespread in the united states . newline_char a new report released on thursday said that in the past five years , researchers have identified 43 patients in the united states who became sick with infections from one type of cre . newline_char ) these cases all involved cre that share a particular method of defeating the antibiotics : they have enzymes called oxa-48-like carbapenemases that break down the drugs , said the report from the centers for disease control and prevention . newline_char other types of cre have different methods of resisting the antibiotic . newline_char [ 6 superbugs to watch out for ] this particular type of cre that is the focus of the new report is " noteworthy " because the enzyme that thwarts the antibiotic is encoded on a piece of genetic material called a plasmid , " which can
