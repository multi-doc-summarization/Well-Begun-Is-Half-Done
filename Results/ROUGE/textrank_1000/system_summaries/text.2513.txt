age caption researchers were surprised to see liquid water coming up through the drill hole as temperatures were below freezing researchers say they have discovered a large reservoir of melt water that sits under the greenland ice sheet all year round . newline_char the water is stored in the air space between the ice particles , like the juice in a snow cone prof rick forster , university of utah according to the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the ice sheet lost 34 billion tonnes of ice per year between 1992 and 2001 - but this increased to 215 billion tonnes between 2002 and 2011 scientists still have many unanswered questions about the direction and speed and ultimate destination of this melted water . newline_char in the spring of 2011 , researchers drilled deep into this slushy layer and to their surprise , found liquid water flowing back to the surface even though air temperatures were -15 degrees c. newline_char image caption the researchers drilled in areas with large accumulations of snow on the surface they believe that it holds roughly 140 billion tonnes of water , which is the equivalent to 0.4mm of sea level rise per year - about half of what greenland contributes to the sea every year . story_separator_special_tag every year , greenland adds 0.03 inches ( 0.7 mm ) of water to global sea level rise from melting snow and ice , forster said . newline_char water from the greenland snow aquifer draining from a drill core extracted 40 feet ( 12 meters ) below the surface of the ice sheet in april , before the summer surface melt , with air temperatures of 5 degrees fahrenheit ( minus 15 degrees celsius ) .
