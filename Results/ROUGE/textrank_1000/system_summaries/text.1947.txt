i was giving talks saying saturn has a giant invisible ring , which makes you sound just perfectly crazy , ” said lead author douglas hamilton , a planetary scientist at the university of maryland , college park . newline_char but in 2009 , nasa ’ s infrared-sensing spitzer space telescope picked up another ring so large that the entire planet and its main rings appear as a small dot in the middle . newline_char hamilton and colleagues first went looking for this " giant invisible ring " because of the strange two-tone coloring of iapetus , one of saturn ’ s moons . story_separator_special_tag a , individual wise frames manually combined : scattered light from saturn forms the large white overexposed blob with a black centre while four diagonal diffraction spikes radiate outward . newline_char iapetus ( black dot ) and the more distant phoebe ( white dot ) are visible at nine o ’ clock . newline_char back in 2009 , a team of researchers working with nasa 's infrared spitzer space telescope discovered that there was an outer ring circling saturn that had not been known to exist—made mostly of extremely tiny dark dust particles , the ring was difficult to see . story_separator_special_tag hamilton and colleagues describe saturn ’ s biggest , strangest , most recently-discovered ring in a study published today in nature . newline_char the so-called phoebe ring is not only bigger than the researchers thought , it appears to be made of unusually fine particles—particles that continually collide with saturn ’ s moon iapetus as it circles the planet , turning the moon ’ s leading face black . newline_char hamilton was part of the team that discovered the phoebe ring in 2009 , with help from the spitzer space telescope . newline_char phoebe , a dark-as-coal moon further away from saturn than iapetus , was the second piece of the puzzle .
