pe canaveral , florida ( reuters ) - a 1-ton european science satellite plunged back into earth 's atmosphere and incinerated with debris most likely landing in the southern regions of the atlantic ocean , officials said on monday . newline_char the last contact by ground tracking stations with europe 's gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer , known as goce , was at 5:42 p.m. est ( 2242 gmt ) on sunday as the spacecraft flew just 75 miles above antarctica , the european space agency said . newline_char extrapolating from computer models , officials believe goce hit the upper atmosphere about 50 miles above the planet 's surface no later than 7:16 p.m. est sunday ( 0016 gmt monday ) near the falkland islands . story_separator_special_tag image caption goce needed its engine power to stay in orbit the european space agency 's ( esa ) goce satellite has re-entered the earth 's atmosphere , burning up in the process . newline_char data from the united states strategic command ( usstratcom ) indicated that re-entry occurred a little over one orbit of the earth later , with the spacecraft starting to break up at 00:16 gmt on monday at an altitude of about 80km . newline_char " goce survived for a few minutes longer than we expected - but since re-entries are difficult to predict , this is not very surprising , " holger krag from esa 's space debris office told bbc news . newline_char image caption goce 's principal objective was to make maps of the variation in the pull of gravity across the earth goce 's slender , fin-shaped construction , combined with its magnetic attitude-control system , maintained a stable orientation until very late in the descent . newline_char goce ( gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer ) was launched in 2009 as part of a series of innovative environmental research satellites .
