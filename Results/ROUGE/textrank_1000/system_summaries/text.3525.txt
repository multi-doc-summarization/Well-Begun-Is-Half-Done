sa announced monday that after 35 years of exploration , its voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new , unanticipated region of space near the edge of the solar system -- a " magnetic highway " where charged particles take the " exit ramp " to interstellar space . newline_char the region connects the sun 's magnetic field lines to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing " lower-energy charged particles that originate from inside our heliosphere ... newline_char voyager 1 may remain within the heliopause for another two to three years , but it 's hard to anticipate how long it will be until the probe leaves the solar system , nasa scientists said . story_separator_special_tag -- nasa 's voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new region at the far reaches of our solar system that scientists feel is the final area the spacecraft has to cross before reaching interstellar space . newline_char scientists refer to this new region as a magnetic highway for charged particles because our sun 's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines . newline_char the voyager team infers this region is still inside our solar bubble because the direction of the magnetic field lines has not changed . newline_char " although voyager 1 still is inside the sun 's environment , we now can taste what it 's like on the outside because the particles are zipping in and out on this magnetic highway , " said edward stone , voyager project scientist based at the california institute of technology , pasadena . story_separator_special_tag ed stone , voyager project scientist , based at caltech , explained that this highway is connected to interstellar space , but is still inside the magnetic field of the sun .
