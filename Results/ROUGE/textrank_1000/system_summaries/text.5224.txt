y points key points : taller people have more cells in their body , as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow for every 10cm over the average height , a person 's risk for cancer increases 10 per cent new analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this , and also finds a few specific cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height leonard nunney , an evolutionary biologist at the university of california , riverside , looked at massive cancer databases to find out how the number of cells in a person 's body , using height as a proxy , might affect their risk of developing cancer . newline_char reporting in the proceedings of the royal society b , he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall : for every 10 centimetres over the average height , the risk of developing any cancer increased by around 10 per cent . story_separator_special_tag report suggests link between height and cancer risk could simply be because there are more cells for something to go wrong in taller people have a greater risk of cancer because they are bigger and so have more cells in their bodies in which dangerous mutations can occur , new research has suggested . newline_char a number of studies have previously found a link between a lofty stature and a greater risk of developing some form of cancer , with research suggesting that for every 10cm of height within the typical range for humans , the risk increases by about 10 % . story_separator_special_tag leonard nunney , a professor of biology at the university of california riverside , analyzed previous sets of data on people who had contracted cancer -- each of which included more than 10,000 cases for both men and women -- and compared the figures with anticipated rates based on their height .
