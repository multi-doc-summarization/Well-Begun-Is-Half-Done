is year 's low-oxygen " dead zone " along louisiana coast covers 5,052 square miles , an area the size of the state of connecticut but about 800 square miles less than the 2013 dead zone , according to a week-long survey released monday . newline_char the finding , by a team of scientists led by louisiana universities marine consortium director nancy rabalais , is within the range estimated in late june by scientists who based their prediction on measurements of the amount of nutrients carried in may by the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers . newline_char based on the 2014 results , the five-year average size of the low-oxygen area is 5,543 square miles , which is almost three times larger than the target set by a federal/state mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force in 2001 as part of a national effort to reduce the size of the dead zone . newline_char " the mississippi river discharge levels and associated nutrient data , supplied in may by the usgs , pointed to an average size hypoxia area based on the inputs which fuel mid-summer 's dead zone algal growth , " rabalais said in a separate news release issued monday by noaa . story_separator_special_tag the primary cause of the annual phenomenon is excess nutrient runoff from farms along the mississippi river , which empties into the gulf , said gene turner , a researcher at louisiana state university 's coastal ecology institute . story_separator_special_tag researchers who annually measure the oxygen deprived " dead zone " in the gulf of mexico have recently found that this year it is nearly as large as the state of connecticut . newline_char ( photo : pixabay ) researchers who annually measure the oxygen deprived " dead zone " in the gulf of mexico have recently found that this year it is nearly as large as the state of connecticut .
