rt hyperkinetic pop-culture joyride — nods to everything from films like " caged heat " and " kill bill " to seizure-inducing japanese television and the color-drenched photography of david lachapelle — part electric dance extravaganza , " telephone " is nine-plus minutes of everything you could possibly love about gaga ( and beyoncé , who , we 're sure you know by now , co-stars in the clip ) , only amped up to the nth degree . newline_char from there , we get glimpses of gaga 's life behind bars — make-out sessions in the exercise yard ( where she is inexplicably wearing sunglasses made out of half-smoked cigarettes ) , the occasional catfight in the commissary — and then , after nearly three minutes of introduction , gaga takes a phone call and the song finally begins , first with just some gentle electronic notes and lg 's tender vocals , then morphing into a stuttering electro-pop stomper , complemented by a dance sequence ( gaga and her inmates strutting and climbing dressed only in studded underwear , fishnets and stiletto heels ) that 's sure to make the censors rather nervous . newline_char gaga is then bailed out , but not before she busts a michael jackson shuffle while one of the guards surfs around on the dating site plentyoffish.com ( a scene which is n't even the strangest example of product placement in this video ) . newline_char gaga and beyoncé begin the video 's third over-the-top dance number , popping and strutting while the dead bodies lay around them . story_separator_special_tag to view this video or group , please click here to sign in or sign up and verify that you are of the appropriate age .
