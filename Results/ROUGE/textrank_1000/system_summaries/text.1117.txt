wever , new research by st√©phanie mazza and colleagues at the university of lyon , recently published in the journal psychological science , suggests another potential benefit of sleep : improved relearning . newline_char in the study , 40 french-speaking adult participants learned a list of 16 swahili-french word pairs ( for example , nyanya-tomate ) , relearned those word pairs after a period of 12 hours that did or did not include sleep , and were tested on their memory for the word pairs after one week and after six months . newline_char during the learning session , participants first studied all of the word pairs . newline_char at the relearning session , participants again attempted to recall the french word of each pair , and then continued cycling through the entire list until they could recall all pairs perfectly . newline_char thus , by the time the relearning session was complete , any word pair that had been forgotten in the intervening 12 hours had been practiced until it could be correctly recalled once more . newline_char however , substantial differences emerged at the relearning session : participants in the sleep group recalled an average of 10 word pairs on their first attempt , whereas those in the wake group could only muster up about 7 ; in addition , those that had slept took only about three cycles through the list to finish relearning , whereas those that had not slept needed twice that amount . story_separator_special_tag in the study reported here , we investigated whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation could help to save practice time during relearning . newline_char we found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention .
