metimes , though , it pays off — like for one ( anonymous ) aussie gold-digger that found a 4.1-kilo nugget in victoria 's golden triangle . newline_char informally named " friday 's joy " , the nugget will go up for auction and is expected to net more than $ 250,000 — the same value that the ( relatively ) well-known cindy 's pride , one of the largest single gold deposits ever found in australia , is worth . newline_char the 145-ounce nugget was actually the second one the wisely-wants-to-remain-anonymous prospector found , but it was a damn sight larger than the 9-ounce speck that drew him to the location originally . newline_char and apparently gold detecting is a more lucrative hobby than we thought , too ; a prospector called mick brown found a 2.7-kilogram nugget worth $ 175,000 that he called " fair dinkum " last year , also with a minelab detector . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag an australian prospector has discovered a massive 145-ounce gold nugget worth more than $ 250,000 . newline_char dubbed ‘ friday ’ s joy ’ , the nugget was found with a minelab metal detector in an already work-over area at the southern edge of central victoria ’ s golden triangle , an area well known for yielding gold , finding the top of the nugget only around 30cm below the ground . newline_char “ he was prospecting in an area that others had clearly worked over and this just goes to show that there ’ s plenty of gold still coming out of victoria , ” he said . newline_char kendall added that the nugget was on par with the 159.3 ounce ‘ cindy ’ s pride ’ , and surpassed prospector mick brown ’ s 87-ounce ‘ fair dinkum ’ gold nugget found last year near the wedderburn , around 200km north of melbourne ; it was later auctioned for $ 175,000 .
