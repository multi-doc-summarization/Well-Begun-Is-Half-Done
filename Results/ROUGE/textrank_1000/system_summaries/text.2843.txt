w conservationists who believe the bovine ancestor was key to preserving the continent 's ecosystem have said they are 'rewilding ' the fourth generation of their experimental auroch replacement as part of the tauros project . newline_char founder and ecologist ronald goderie told cnn : " we thought we needed a grazer that is fully self-sufficient in case of big predators ... newline_char " in conjunction with the rewilding europe group , the tauros , bred from a number of current species with auroch ancestry , have been released into areas of spain , portugal , croatia , the czech republic and romania , where they have had to contend with wolves and other predators . story_separator_special_tag for thousands of years the aurochs were the largest land mammals in europe , until the rise of human civilization decimated their numbers , and the last of the species died in poland in 1627 -- one of the first recorded cases of extinction . newline_char conservationists now believe the loss of the keystone herbivore was tragic for biodiversity in europe , arguing that the aurochs ' huge appetite for grazing provided a natural " gardening service " that maintained landscapes and created the conditions for other species to thrive . newline_char " you could see from the first generation that apart from the horn size , there was enough wild in the breed to produce animals far closer to the auroch than we would have expected , " says goderie . newline_char in the wild the tauros programme connected with rewilding europe early on , a group that supports the restoration of natural processes through projects that range from rebuilding rivers to introducing apex predators . newline_char rewilding europe was able to provide protected land across the continent ; in croatia , spain , portugal , the czech republic , and romania , where goderie 's cross-breeds could test themselves in the wild .
