ap ) — scientists from the u.s. and denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth 's crust that 's responsible for the famous old faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at yellowstone national park . newline_char the team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park , said lead scientist carol finn with the u.s. geological survey . newline_char similar to the regular eruptions of old faithful , hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure , causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface . newline_char " nobody knows anything about the flow paths " for the hot water that erupts from yellowstone 's geysers , finn said . story_separator_special_tag this week , a survey will begin to map the underground hydrothermal features of yellowstone national park for the first time . newline_char the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , in collaboration with the aarhus university in denmark and the university of wyoming , will use a helicopter carrying electromagnetic technology that resembles a giant hula hoop to record tiny voltage signals . newline_char carol finn , one of the scientists on the surveying team , said she has been looking forward to this for ten years . newline_char ” the goal of the project is to fill in the gaps of knowledge about what causes geysers like old faithful and hydrothermal explosions by locating where all that heated water flows underground . newline_char “ there ’ s just a lot we don ’ t know and this survey is really exciting because it ’ s going to be the first view of a large portion of the groundwater system , of the water underground that feeds all of these thermal features , ” said finn .
