 honor of nicolas roeg 's 1976 sci-fi headscratcher " the man who fell to earth " being rereleased in new york , and the continuing national rollout of terrence malick 's time-fracturing memory piece " the tree of life , " salon presents its list -- all right , fine , my personal list -- of great trippy movies . newline_char my list includes a couple of acknowledged , popular classics , a feature-length montage , two works by masters of experimental cinema , and an underappreciated recent film by a surrealist whose name rhymes with wavid clynch . newline_char what if you added them , and at the exact moment that you added them , in another universe an alternate version of you was adding the exact same titles ? newline_char what if that alternate version of you had the same name as you , only spelled backward ? story_separator_special_tag " fantasia " is a series of short films linked together by the framing story of an orchestra performing a concert ( the conductor is leopold stokowski ) . newline_char the films within the film are hypothetical visions occurring in the mind 's eye of the listener . newline_char but because the mind 's eye in question belonged to disney , the screen was filled with disney imagery unmoored from a story -- an experimental film in kid-flick drag . newline_char it was all about how the music interacted with the images -- so precisely that it was as if the two art forms , instrumental performance and animation , were dancing together . newline_char the dancing hippos . newline_char parts of it are silly or cloying . newline_char other parts are terrifying . newline_char " fantasia " was the first ( and so far only ) walt disney film to prompt viewers to ask , " what am i looking at ? newline_char " it 's the disney movie as powerful hallucinogen . newline_char for kids .
