dden swarm there has been increasing evidence of links between the process of oil and gas extraction and earthquakes in states like arkansas , texas , ohio and oklahoma in recent years . newline_char if a fault is close to failure , the amount that the pressure is going up at these locations in our model is enough to push them over the edge dr katie keranen , cornell university in 2011 , a small number of people were injured and 14 houses were destroyed in the town of prague , oklahoma by a 5.7 tremor . newline_char this new research goes further , linking a large swarm of oklahoma tremors with a number of specific water wells , distantly located . newline_char " there is a high ratio of water to oil , " said the study 's lead author dr katie keranen from cornell university . story_separator_special_tag past research has shown that processes such as wastewater injection at oil drilling and fracking sites throughout the state could induce a small number of earthquakes but scientists have never been able to specifically link some of the more distant or stronger earthquakes with these sometimes faraway wastewater wells . newline_char a study published today in science explains how wastewater injection sites—areas where toxic water left over from oil drilling and fracking processes is injected into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting freshwater—could be driving the sharp increase in the sometimes-disastrous earthquake events . newline_char in so doing the team determined that a relatively small number of wastewater injection sites used in oil drilling and fracking in oklahoma may have the ability after all to induce relatively strong earthquakes a long distance away , throughout the state . newline_char but like the authors of the new paper , he , too , has found evidence linking the oklahoma quakes specifically to oil and gas activity .
