ientists have found a new virus that can be transmitted by blood transfusions and other blood-based products . newline_char it looks a little like the hepatitis c virus , which can cause permanent liver damage , and a little like the human pegivirus , which appears to be harmless , the team reports in the journal mbio . newline_char it ’ s clearly transmitted as a result of human ( blood ) transfusion , ” said infectious disease expert dr. newline_char now that the genetic sequence of this new virus is published , lipkin said , other scientists can start looking for it . story_separator_special_tag amit kapoor , a virologist at columbia university led the team that identified the new virus—and which has named it human hepegivirus 1 , or hhpgv-1—notes that many people understand that humans coexist with myriad bacteria that are not dangerous , but they don ’ t realize the same holds true for some viruses . newline_char as part of a search for novel human viruses , the group scoured blood samples from a cohort of 46 people that were collected before and after they received a blood transfusion between 1974 and 1980 . newline_char using what ’ s known as “ deep sequencing ” techniques , kapoor ’ s team fished for nucleic acid sequences ( the building blocks of dna ) of known viruses , and found two people who posttransfusion had what looked like a novel flavivirus , the family that includes hepatitis c and human pegivirus . newline_char based on later blood samples that were analyzed , both of these people subsequently cleared the virus , the team reports online today in mbio . newline_char although contamination frequently upends the supposed discovery of a new virus , hhpgv-1 looks real , says michael houghton , a virologist at the university of alberta in edmonton who helped identify the viral cause of hepatitis c.
