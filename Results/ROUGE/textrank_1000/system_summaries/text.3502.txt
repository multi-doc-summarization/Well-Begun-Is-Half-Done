 all goes well , the curiosity rover will be on the mars surface at about 1:17 a.m. eastern time , and 13 minutes , 48 seconds later ( the time it takes for a radio signal to travel 154 million miles to earth from mars ) , there will be confirmation and cheering in the control room at 1:31 a.m. newline_char that is not powerful enough to be picked up by antenna on earth , but a nasa orbiter , mars odyssey , will act as a relay , re-transmitting the data to earth in real-time . newline_char if anything goes wrong with the curiosity-to-odyssey-to-earth communications , then the result will be silence . newline_char if odyssey misses curiosity ’ s messages , a second orbiter , the mars reconnaissance orbiter , will also be listening . newline_char but reconnaissance orbiter will be recording the data , not relaying it , and engineers on earth will not get to sift through that information until hours later . newline_char nasa engineers said it is quite possible for curiosity to land successfully and that they would not find out for hours . story_separator_special_tag that tracking would come from the odyssey orbiter circling mars , if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time . newline_char if no signal arrives from curiosity via three mars orbiters and the deep space network after 18 hours , nasa officials said , then they would start to worry about its safety . newline_char nasa ’ s chief scientist john grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty , in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board , curiosity is “ the most important nasa mission of the decade. newline_char the united states is the only nation to land a vehicle on mars and complete its mission , having done it six out of seven tries .
