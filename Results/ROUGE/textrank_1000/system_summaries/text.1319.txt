tory_separator_special_tag judge mitchell nance says he wo n't hear anymore adoption cases that involve gay adults.https : //t.co/0lhgamwtv5 — wkyt ( @ wkyt ) april 28 , 2017 two years after a kentucky county clerk stirred national attention for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples , a family court judge in the same state announced he will no longer hear adoption cases involving gay parents , calling his stance on the issue “ a matter of conscience. newline_char the judge disqualified himself from any adoption cases involving gay couples , citing judicial ethics codes requiring that judges recuse themselves whenever they have a “ personal bias or prejudice ” concerning a case . newline_char kentucky state law permits gay couples to adopt children , and the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2015 that all states must allow same-sex marriage . newline_char nance ’ s recusal drew some comparisons to the case of rowan county clerk kim davis , who was jailed after she refused in the face of multiple court orders to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples , saying she couldn ’ t issue the licenses because her name was on them , and it violated her religious beliefs . newline_char nance told the glasgow daily times he issued the order so there wouldn ’ t be a lag if an adoption case was filed in his court concerning adoption by gay parents . newline_char chris hartman , kentucky fairness campaign director , told the glasgow daily times nance ’ s decision not to hear adoption cases for gay parents is “ clear discrimination. newline_char “ if we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law , as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality , ” spokesman martin cothran said in a statement on the group ’ s facebook page , “ then , in the interest of fairness , we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases.
