king design cues from mother nature herself , researchers are building atms that fend off thieves with a spray of hot , steaming foam . newline_char the inspiration for this dastardly defense mechanism comes from none other than the bombardier beetle , which sprays near-boiling acid at any foes who coming knocking . newline_char gif researchers at eth zurich university took cues from the deadly beetle and built two chemical filled honeycomb chambers . newline_char since the two are only separate by a thin sheet of lacquer , any tampering will cause the chamber to break immediately , triggering a reaction that produces water vapor , oxygen , and heat . story_separator_special_tag the bombardier beetle inspired the researchers of eth zurich . newline_char two separately stored chemicals are mixed in a reaction chamber in the beetle 's abdomen . newline_char he and his team therefore looked to the bombardier beetle for inspiration and developed a chemical defence mechanism designed to prevent vandalism – a self-defending surface composed of several sandwich-like layers of plastic . newline_char if the surface is damaged , hot foam is sprayed in the face of the attacker . newline_char like a fuse the researchers use plastic films with a honeycomb structure for their self-defending surface . story_separator_special_tag it ’ s my fault because i voted for clinton when she ran against obama in the 2008 primary , but i didn ’ t tell anyone because she was the unpopular choice . newline_char it ’ s my fault because i voted for clinton when she ran against sanders in the 2016 primary , and i didn ’ t tell anyone because again she was the unpopular choice . newline_char it ’ s my fault because during the long months of the primary and the general election i didn ’ t tell anyone how strongly i felt about clinton .
