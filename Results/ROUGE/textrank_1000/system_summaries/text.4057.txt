rhard gries , form part of the team , said she was initially a little reluctant and disgusted to act as a host so the pests could feed and scientists could gather and analyze the bugs skin and feces . newline_char gerhard gries said they initially found a pheromone blend -- chemical substances secreted by animals for detection -- in the skin of bedbugs . newline_char britton joined the team and used the university 's state-of-the-art spectrometers to study the chemicals regine gries found in the bedbugs ' shed skin . newline_char britton , the gries and their students then discovered a histamine , a molecule that had previously eluded researchers , signalled a " safe shelter " to the bedbugs , meaning once they came into contact with it they remained in place . story_separator_special_tag biologist regine gries discovered the pheromones after acting as a host for more than a thousand bedbugs during the research , which also involved her husband , biology professor gerhard gries , sfu chemist robert britton and a team of students . newline_char the gries research began eight years ago , when they initially isolated a pheromone mix that attracted bedbugs in lab experiments , but not in bedbug-infested apartments . newline_char britton was then brought in to the team to study the tiny amounts of chemicals regine gries had isolated from shed bedbug skin and figure out why bedbugs find human skin so appealing . newline_char after two years , britton and the gries discovered the answer is histamine , a chemical which signals " safe shelter " to the bloodsucking pests . newline_char key to bedbug trap is in the feces ​however , despite their extensive research , the gries and their team still could not combine the histamine or pheromone blend to make an effective trap — so they began analyzing airborne chemicals from bedbug feces .
