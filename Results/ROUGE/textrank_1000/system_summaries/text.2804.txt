adimir dinets , a research assistant professor at the university of tennessee , knoxville , was guiding a bird- and mammal-watching tour through desembarco del granma national park , cuba , when he first noticed the cavern-hunting snakes . newline_char the boas involved could all be found basking near the cave ’ s entrance during the day , while the bats slumbered in an adjacent chamber separated by a narrow passage . newline_char other snakes would take up similar hunting positions as dawn approached , catching the bats as they returned . newline_char during each potential feeding opportunity , dinets dutifully recorded the position of the snakes as well as their hunting success , or lack thereof . newline_char ” after 8 days of records , dinets concluded the snakes coordinated their hunts , and published his results in the animal behavior and cognition . story_separator_special_tag vladimir dinets , a research assistant professor of psychology , observed the cuban boa—the island nation ’ s largest native terrestrial predator—in bat caves for the study . newline_char many cuban caves shelter large bat colonies , and in some of them small populations of boas regularly hunt the bats as they fly out at dusk and return at dawn . newline_char dinets noticed that the boas hung down from the ceiling of the cave entrance and grabbed passing bats in midair . newline_char he found that if more than one boa was present , the snakes coordinated their positions in such a way that they formed a wall across the entrance . newline_char such group hunts were always successful , and the more snakes were present , the less time it took each to capture a bat . newline_char “ it is possible that coordinated hunting is not uncommon among snakes , but it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out , ” dinets said .
