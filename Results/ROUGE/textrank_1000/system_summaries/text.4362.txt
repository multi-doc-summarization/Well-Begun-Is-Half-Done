1,112-y tree-ring record of moisture shows that in opposition to conventional wisdom , the climate during the rise of the 13 th -century mongol empire was a period of persistent moisture , unprecedented in the last 1,000 y . newline_char although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests , no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the mongol empire . newline_char in combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction , our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of chinggis khan ’ s ( genghis khan ’ s ) 13th-century mongol empire was warm and persistently wet . newline_char this period , characterized by 15 consecutive years of above-average moisture in central mongolia and coinciding with the rise of chinggis khan , is unprecedented over the last 1,112 y . newline_char tree-ring and meteorological data also suggest that the early 21st-century drought in central mongolia was the hottest drought in the last 1,112 y , consistent with projections of warming over inner asia . story_separator_special_tag american researchers studying the rings of ancient trees in central mongolia have discovered that his rise coincided with the mildest , wettest weather in more than 1,000 years . newline_char charismatic leader the research shows that the years before genghis khan 's rule were characterised by severe drought from 1180 to 1190 , the study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences said . newline_char " the transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events , " study co-author and west virginia university tree-ring scientist amy hessl told the afp news agency . newline_char trees living in such conditions grow more slowly and are particularly sensitive to weather changes - and as a result provide an abundance of data to study , scientists say .
