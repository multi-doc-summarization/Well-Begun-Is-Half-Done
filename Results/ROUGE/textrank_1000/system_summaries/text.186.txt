w research from the national resources defense council , an environmental advocacy group , has concluded that 10 % of the country ’ s coastal and lakefront beaches fail to meet the environmental protection agency ’ s water-safety standards—in other words , they ’ re ripe with bacteria . story_separator_special_tag and even though stormwater remains a leading cause of pollution at california ’ s beaches , hoping for less rain is not a long-term solution . newline_char according to nrdc ’ s annual beach water report , testing the waters : a guide to water quality at vacation beaches , released today , 9 percent of water quality samples collected last year at california beaches contained bacteria levels that failed to meet the most protective threshold for swimmer safety set by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) – putting california , sadly , on par with a 10 percent failure rate for the country ’ s beaches overall . newline_char far too many of the state ’ s beaches are failing to meet this benchmark for safe water 20 , 30 , or 40 percent ( and upwards ) of the time , putting beachgoers at increased risk of swimming in polluted water that can cause serious waterborne illnesses like stomach flu , pinkeye , and even respiratory ailments and neurological disorders . newline_char however , in addition to dirty runoff , our local waters are threatened by sewage spills , climate change , and a lack of federal policies that could fully protect the streams and wetlands that help sustain clean beaches . newline_char wetlands and small streams help ensure that beaches downstream remain safe for swimming and fishing by removing pollutants from the water that passes through them and by retaining stormwater that often causes pollution problems .
