tory_separator_special_tag dean-charles chapman is currently known on game of thrones for playing king tommen baratheon , first of his name and however it goes , who took the throne in season 4 after his brother joffrey 's death . newline_char but chapman has only played tommen since 2014 , because the character was recast from the much younger actor , callum wharry . newline_char hello giggles first caught the similarities , noticing that the the king who 's " only half-lannister " looks exactly like his pure-blooded lannister cousin ( and also , imdb says so ) . newline_char for reference , that 's tommen on the left and martyn on the right : image : hbo it 's an easy thing to miss because poor martyn lannister only appeared for two episodes in the third season before getting the axe . story_separator_special_tag then , how did we miss the fact that dean-charles chapman ( aka king tommen baratheon ) played another character in the thrones-verse ? newline_char ! hbo chapman actually played another member of tommen ’ s extended family , martyn lannister , waaaay back in season 3 . newline_char hbo that ’ s right , king tommen is also martyn lannister . newline_char also , sadly , martyn and his brother were killed off by lord rickard karstark in revenge for jaime lannister killing his own son . newline_char annyyyyywayyy , the important thing to take away from all of this , is that martyn was a son of kevan lannister , aka tywin ’ s younger brother . newline_char but , this does mean chapman not only played multiple characters in game of thrones , but actual family members ! newline_char given the lannister family ’ s penchant for incest , having several people in that lineage look the same ( like exactly the same ) would not be a surprise .
