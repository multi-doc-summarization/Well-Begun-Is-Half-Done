christian charisius/european pressphoto agency ) a group of scientists says it has now reconstructed the history of the planet ’ s sea levels arcing back over some 3,000 years — leading it to conclude that the rate of increase experienced in the 20th century was “ extremely likely ” to have been faster than during nearly the entire period . newline_char “ we can say with 95 percent probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries , ” said bob kopp , a climate scientist at rutgers university who led the research with nine colleagues from several u.s. and global universities . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag ( photo : joe raedle , getty images ) sea levels rose faster in the past century than during the previous 27 centuries due to man-made global warming , a pair of studies published monday found . newline_char the study , " temperature-driven global sea-level variability in the common era , " was published in the peer-reviewed proceedings of the national academy of sciences . story_separator_special_tag so far as i know , until now , no study has extended the links all the way from burning fossil fuels , to global warming , to sea level rise , to coastal floods that were caused unambiguously by us . story_separator_special_tag significance we present the first , to our knowledge , estimate of global sea-level ( gsl ) change over the last ∼3,000 years that is based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions . newline_char semiempirical modeling indicates that , without global warming , gsl in the 20th century very likely would have risen by between −3 cm and +7 cm , rather than the ∼14 cm observed . newline_char abstract we assess the relationship between temperature and global sea-level ( gsl ) variability over the common era through a statistical metaanalysis of proxy relative sea-level reconstructions and tide-gauge data .
