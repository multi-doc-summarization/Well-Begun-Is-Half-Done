w developments , such as information about how the plane ’ s communication systems were shut off , have lowered the probability that the plane disappeared because of an accident and increased the likelihood of deliberate diversion . newline_char which explanation is the current leader , in turn , affects the probability of finding the plane at any given location : a deliberate act has made spots farther from the takeoff point of kuala lumpur more likely . newline_char its founding principle is that most new situations can be assessed and assigned probabilities : how likely is this restaurant to be good ? newline_char for example , we know that 60 percent of our restaurant meals in town have been good , or that duke has won titles in four of the last 25 seasons ( 16 percent ) . newline_char it ’ s 75 percent , based on this new information , since 75 percent of meals in full restaurants have been good . story_separator_special_tag image copyright afp image caption members of the brazilian frigate constituicao recovering debris in june 2009 statisticians helped locate an air france plane in 2011 which was missing for two years . newline_char image copyright getty images image caption debris from the air france crash is laid out for investigation in 2009 american , brazilian and french ships , planes and submarines all searched for the plane , but they could n't find it . newline_char to turn all this information into numbers and probability , keller and her team from metron inc in virginia , relied on bayesian statistics named after a british presbyterian minister called thomas bayes . newline_char keller and her colleagues went through all the available information and assessed the uncertainties of each piece of data - applying bayesian principles of probability to work out the
