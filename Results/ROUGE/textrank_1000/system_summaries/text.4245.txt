 a phone interview , arlie hochschild , the author of the outsourced self and the foundational feminist text on women and housework , the second shift , makes the argument that a women ’ s desire for a clean home has deeper origins than just marketing . newline_char i suspect that women are more driven to keep a clean house because they know they—before their male partners—will be judged for having a dirty one . newline_char unfortunately , the notion that women will be the first to be judged for a messy home and the first to be commended for an orderly one isn ’ t much of an incentive for men to pick up a mop . story_separator_special_tag people who care a lot about neater homes spend more time cleaning them because that makes them happy . newline_char viewing housework inequality as entirely a phenomenon of exploitative men free-riding off of female domestic labor makes sense only if you think men derive equal enjoyment from a cleaner and neater home . newline_char if that were the case , men who lived by themselves , or with other men , would have to keep their own homes tidy until they could conscript a wife or girlfriend to do their cleaning . newline_char ( to be clear , this was my brother , not me — i was content with the pizza box tower , but if it was my floor , i ’ d have cleaned up the milkshake . newline_char ) my post-college group house was vastly neater than my college home , yet still messy enough that my girlfriend refused to set foot in it , insisting we spend all our domestic time at her place . newline_char we ’ re now married , which seems like the proper place to note that the mental image you have probably formed of my domestic habits is not accurate .
