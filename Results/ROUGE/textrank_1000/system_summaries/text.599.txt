 dennis prager - december 24 , 2013 as a jew , and a religious one at that , i want to wish my fellow americans a merry christmas . newline_char apparently , many americans have forgotten that christmas is not only a christian holy day , but also an american national holiday . newline_char just as we wish one another a " happy thanksgiving " or a " happy fourth , " so , too , we should wish fellow americans a " merry christmas . newline_char which is , of course , entirely their right to do ; no one forces anyone to celebrate any american holiday . newline_char because the entire society -- jews , muslims , hindus , buddhists , atheists as well as christians -- all benefit from the goodness and joy that the christmas season engenders . story_separator_special_tag second , it ’ s okay for jews to celebrate christmas . newline_char for many people , christmas is more about santa than jesus anyway ( at least in my secular book . newline_char more : jesus wasn ’ t white , but santa definitely is besides , if santa were jewish , he wouldn ’ t be the only jew in the christmas pantheon . newline_char besides , tons of jews are already celebrating christmas anyway . newline_char y told me that even though she would never suggest that jews renounce hanukkah in favor of christmas , she understands why some jews could feel left out of what can seem like a national holiday . newline_char “ for jewish americans , it would be almost like not being a part of labor day or memorial day or fourth of july weekend , ” she said . newline_char on christmas , kids get their presents delivered all at once by a psychic , cookie-loving , reindeer-riding celebrity !
