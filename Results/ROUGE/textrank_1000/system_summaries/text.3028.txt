ston russian hackers exploited a bug in microsoft windows and other software to spy on computers used by nato , the european union , ukraine and companies in the energy and telecommunications sectors , according to cyber intelligence firm isight partners . newline_char isight said it did not know what data had been found by the hackers , though it suspected they were seeking information on the ukraine crisis , as well as diplomatic , energy and telecom issues , based on the targets and the contents of phishing emails used to infect computers with tainted files . newline_char the five-year cyber espionage campaign is still going on , according to isight , which dubbed the operation " sandworm team " because it found references to the " dune " science fiction series in the software code used by the hackers . newline_char the operation used a variety of ways to attack the targets over the years , isight said , adding that the hackers began only in august to exploit a vulnerability found in most versions of windows . newline_char researchers with dallas-based isight said they believed the hackers are russian because of language clues in the software code and because of their choice of targets . newline_char while technical indicators do not indicate whether the hackers have ties to the russian government , hultquist said he believed they were supported by a nation state because they were engaging in espionage , not cyber crime . newline_char still , researchers believe a large percentage of those targeted systems were infected because the malicious software used was very sophisticated , using a previously unknown attack method that enabled it to get past virtually all known security protections , said drew robinson , a senior technical analyst with isight partners . story_separator_special_tag
