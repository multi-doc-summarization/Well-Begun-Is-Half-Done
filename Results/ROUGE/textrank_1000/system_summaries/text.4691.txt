 has not been useful for early diagnosis of cancer because of insufficient sensitivity to detect really small tumors that only shed minute quantities of dna into the blood , as well as difficulties with identifying cancer-associated genetic changes without knowing what mutations are present in the primary tumor . newline_char , called targeted error correction sequencing , addresses both of these limitations and demonstrates the feasibility of detecting circulating cell-free dna from many early tumors , suggesting its potential use for cancer screening . story_separator_special_tag 16 , 2017 ( healthday news ) -- a new genetic blood test might pave the way for detecting early stage cancers that often prove fatal when caught too late , a new study suggests . newline_char by reviewing these dna fragments for mutations found in 58 " cancer-driver " genes , the blood test detects many early stage cancers without rendering false positives for healthy people , said velculescu , co-director of cancer biology at the johns hopkins kimmel cancer center , in baltimore . newline_char " to develop a genetic blood test for cancer , researchers must find ways to spot dna mutations linked to cancer while ignoring natural and harmless mutations that regularly occur in humans , velculescu explained  story_separator_special_tag chicago ( reuters ) - a test that scans blood for tumor-specific dna identified early-stage cancer in more than half of 138 patients with the disease , u.s. researchers reported on wednesday , marking a new milestone in the rush for so-called “ liquid biopsies. newline_char ” several companies already offer tests that can detect cancer dna in the blood of patients with late-stage cancers . newline_char researchers behind the early-stage test hope it could be used to identify cancers at a stage when patients have a better chance at survival .
