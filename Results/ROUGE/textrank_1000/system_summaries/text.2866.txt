 infectious disease prevention , improved diets and other positive health behaviors were adopted by people born during the 1800s and early 1900s , death rates plummeted , but women began reaping the longevity benefits at a much faster rate . newline_char in the wake of this massive but uneven decrease in mortality , a review of global data points to heart disease as the culprit behind most of the excess deaths documented in adult men , said usc university professor and aarp professor of gerontology eileen crimmins . newline_char focusing on mortality in adults over the age of 40 , the team found that in individuals born after 1880 , female death rates decreased 70 percent faster than those of males . newline_char surprisingly , smoking accounted for only 30 percent of the difference in mortality between the sexes after 1890 , crimmins said . newline_char the uneven impact of cardiovascular illness-related deaths on men , especially during middle and early older age , raises the question of whether men and women face different heart disease risks due to inherent biological risks and/or protective factors at different points in their lives , finch said . newline_char " further study could include analysis of diet and exercise activity differences between countries , deeper examination of genetics and biological vulnerability between sexes at the cell level , and the relationship of these findings to brain health at later ages , " he  story_separator_special_tag however , recent work with mice reveals that estrogen supplements appear to increase the lifespan of males , and a study of human eunuchs found that these men lived on average about 14 years longer than non-castrated men . newline_char further research is needed in order to understand how genetics might have an impact on stem cell aging in males and females and at the very least , the duo concludes  story_separator_special_tag
