 an event that occurs once every 11 years , the magnetic field of the sun will change its polarity in a matter of months , according new observations by nasa-supported observatories . newline_char " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , the director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement . newline_char " as the field shifts , the " current sheet " — a surface that radiates billions of kilometers outward from the sun 's equator — becomes very wavy , nasa officials said . newline_char the sun 's magnetic field is gearing up to shift , a once in 11 year event , according to nasa officials . newline_char credit : nasa " the sun 's polar magnetic fields weaken , go to zero , and then emerge again with the opposite polarity , " stanford solar physicist phil scherrer said in a statement . story_separator_special_tag " it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , " todd hoeksema , a solar physicist and director of stanford university 's wilcox solar observatory , said in a statement released by the agency . newline_char nearing the mid-point of the sun 's 24th observed solar cycle , the star 's south pole will soon follow the north 's lead and change its magnetic sign . newline_char the change in polarity will have certain effects throughout the heliosphere -- the sun 's domain , which extends well beyond pluto -- but , as nasa notes in its sciencecasts video , one of the largest effects earth can expect is some stormy space weather around the planet .
