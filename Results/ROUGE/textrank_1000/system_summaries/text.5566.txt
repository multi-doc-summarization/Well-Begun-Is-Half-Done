e object — called p/2013 p5 — was discovered in august by the pan-starrs 1 telescope in hawaii , an observation that baffled astronomers . newline_char what it saw was something just as baffling as what pan-starrs astronomers originally described : it was a weird multi-tailed comet-like object . newline_char analysis : hubble ’ s bizarre x-shaped slow-motion asteroid collision apart from the fact that p5 appears to have jets of gas and dust projecting in all directions — like spokes on a bicycle wheel — between the sept. newline_char “ even more amazingly , its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust . newline_char ” in a nutshell , the yorp effect heats up the sun-facing side of an asteroid , but as the asteroid rotates , it radiates heat into space from the dark side . story_separator_special_tag 7 , 2013 : astronomers viewing our solar system 's asteroid belt with nasa 's hubble space telescope have seen for the first time an asteroid with six comet-like tails of dust . newline_char " even more amazing , its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust . newline_char " this nasa hubble space telescope set of images reveals a never-before-seen set of six comet-like tails radiating from a body in the asteroid belt , designated p/2013 p5 . newline_char they do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once . newline_char when hubble looked at the asteroid again sept. newline_char careful modeling by team member jessica agarwal of the max planck institute for solar system research in lindau , germany , showed that the tails could have been formed by a series of impulsive dust-ejection events .
