age copyright samsung image caption samsung acknowledges that it uses software that has an impact on its energy efficiency scores the european commission says it is " following up " two reports that raise concerns that software used in tvs may be skewing their energy rating scores . newline_char power drop televisions ' energy efficiency ratings are based on the power they use while screening a 10-minute video , which contains a mix of fast and slow-moving content shown at different brightness levels . newline_char " image copyright compliantv image caption this graph shows how the samsung tv reduced its power requirement shortly after the start of the test samsung said it " firmly rejected " suggestions that it had designed its tv settings to deliberately produce misleading power performance results . story_separator_special_tag samsung strongly denies that its tvs ’ “ motion lighting ” feature is designed to fool official energy efficiency tests or that it constitutes a defeat device . newline_char the company says it reduces screen brightness in response to numerous types of real-world content including fast-moving action movies and sports and slower moving footage such as weather reports - not just during test conditions . newline_char brussels targets super-sized tvs in drive for energy efficiency read more “ there is no comparison [ between motion lighting and vw defeat devices ] , ” a samsung spokesman said . newline_char ” the apparent differences came to light in unpublished lab tests by an eu-funded research group called compliantv which recorded consistently higher energy consumption rates for the company ’ s models in real-world situations than in official test conditions . newline_char the lab studies found that samsung ’ s ‘ motion lighting ’ feature reduced the tv sets ’ brightness – and power consumption – under international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) test conditions .
