th its a350 xwb jet , airbus integrates the latest design and engineering tricks to quell many of the headaches for flyers , carriers , and pilots . newline_char " the design process was about optimization , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program at airbus , says . newline_char with $ 15 billion worth of research and development under its belt , airbus is hoping that its no-nonsense approach to design and engineering will help it best the competitionâ€”namely the boeing 787 dreamliner and 777 long-distance planes . story_separator_special_tag but commercial aircraft companies airbus and qatar airways think they might have found a solution to the perennial jetlag problem with their latest aeroplane . newline_char one of the main innovations is a system of led lights inside the cabin that are designed to change colour to mimic the sun 's natural glow - and they 're programmed to fit in with our bodies ' natural circadian rhythms no matter what the actual time is . newline_char again , airbus says this should improve comfort for passengers and minimise the effects of jetlag once they step back onto the ground . newline_char over 50 percent of the frame is made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic , reducing the weight of the aircraft and of course the amount of fuel required for long-haul flights . newline_char larger and wider wings , together with flaps that follow the flight path direction rather than the wind , combine to create a 25 percent improvement in the plane 's fuel economy over comparable models currently in the sky , according to airbus . newline_char " the design process was about optimisation , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program , told fast company .
