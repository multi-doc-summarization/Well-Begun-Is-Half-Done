bglacial aquatic environments over the last several decades , by using ground penetrating radar and other remote sensing tools , scientists have discovered that under the massive antarctic ice sheets there lies a vast hydrological system of liquid water . newline_char wissard in order to explore one of these hydrological systems at the margin of the west antarctic ice sheet , we have organized an interdisciplinary project to access the subglacial environment . newline_char the whillans ice stream subglacial access research drilling project ( wissard ) is using a variety of tools and techniques to explore subglacial lake whillans and the nearby grounding zone , on the southeastern edge of the ross sea . newline_char this season our target is the grounding zone , where the massive west antarctic ice sheet atop land meets the ross sea . newline_char the work will help scientists assess the stability of the west antarctic ice sheet , most of which sits below sea level . story_separator_special_tag tomorrow 's edition of the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of microorganisms living far beneath antarctic ice . newline_char special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet , where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years . newline_char saturn 's moon titan , for example , is far colder than earth , but plays host to vast lakes of liquid methane that could be a potential feast for hearty microbes similar to those living under the antarctic ice sheet . newline_char some of the graduate students working on the mission to retrieve microscopic life from beneath antarctica reportedly joked that they may have reached an early peak in their scientific careers . story_separator_special_tag
