 a report published in nature geoscience , researchers claimed that hydrogen ejected from the sun ’ s atmosphere is carried in solar winds and implanted in the lunar soil , where it reacts with oxygen already present on the moon ’ s surface . newline_char “ now we have ready sources of water that can not only be consumed by plants and humans , but also electrolysed into its constituent elements – hydrogen and oxygen – to make rocket fuel , ” she said . newline_char however , geochemist ross taylor from the australian academy of science , who was not involved in the research , said harvesting water from lunar soil would be complicated and using it for human settlement probably unrealistic . newline_char water origin unknown until now with no atmosphere to protect it , the lunar surface is buffeted by solar winds and comet collisions , which create a soil of crushed materials called the ‘ regolith ’ . newline_char researchers analysed a collection of cemented regolith grains – a glass-like material – to find reacting hydrogen and oxygen molecules which they attributed to solar winds . newline_char three independent studies observed water on the surface of the moon in 2009 , but the origin was unknown until now , said liu . newline_char “ the researchers have proved you can generate water on the surface of the moon purely from the impact of the wind of the sun , ” she said . story_separator_special_tag glass beads within moon rocks suggest that water seen on the lunar surface originates from the solar wind , researchers say . newline_char now we have ready sources of water that can be consumed by plants and humans , but also broken up into its constituent elements — oxygen and hydrogen .
