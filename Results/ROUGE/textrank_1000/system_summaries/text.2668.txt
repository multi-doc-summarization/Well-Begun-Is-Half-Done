bert de niro plays a widowed retiree named frank in everybody 's fine . newline_char then there 's this : frank , who has n't seen his brood since the death of their mother a few months earlier , travels from kid to kid ( each son or daughter secretly unhappy , lying to their pop , and not fine at all in his or her own way ) by bus and train , toting a sad rolling carry-on bag . newline_char thing is , frank is the only american born in the age of samsonite who does n't know that rolling bags actually roll , do n't you know , on little wheels that work quite well when the collapsible handle is extended and pulled . newline_char the sight of the world-famous robert de niro , a powerful actor revered for playing tough guys who can smash samsonite with their bare hands , pretending not to know how to pull a handle is so embarrassing that the ick ought to obscure the rest of the movie 's falsehoods . story_separator_special_tag there is n't much that 's fine in " everybody 's fine , " an embarrassing misfire for kirk jones , who once gave us the exhilarating comedy " waking ned devine , " and miramax , a storied company now reduced to little more than a film library . newline_char it 's a no-go almost from the start.de niro plays frank , a man who has been rough on his kids , demanding their success as payment for his hard work supporting them through their formative years . newline_char apparently , sneak attacks are the best approach with this family.you can pretty much guess that when his wife told him the kids were just fine all those years , she was n't being frank .
