cording to a study published in the journal infection and immunity by researchers at the university of california , san diego school of medicine , antibiotic-resistant bacteria , specifically mrsa , are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke . newline_char methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , or mrsa , is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin , bloodstream , or a surgical site , and sometimes causes pneumonia . newline_char in order to do so , crotty alexander and her team tested two groups of mrsa , one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not , to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system . newline_char mrsa exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides , another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation . newline_char another study conducted by researchers at university of california , san diego school of medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke ; vaporized smoke can  story_separator_special_tag in lab studies in human cells and whole mice , mrsa ( methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill , said dr. newline_char laura crotty alexander led a study that found the superbug mrsa becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors . newline_char — hayne palmour iv share photo   reddit ✉ laura crotty alexander led a study that found the superbug mrsa becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors . newline_char — hayne palmour iv cigarette smoke exposure stresses mrsa , causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances , crotty alexander said . newline_char in addition , crotty 's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed mrsa became more resistant antimicrobial peptides , which pierce bacterial cell walls .
