ian fligor , an audiologist who is a member of the world health organization ’ s working group on safe listening devices , advised the team on how to compare its results to data on the 85-decibel workplace limit . newline_char in the end , the overall pick for the children was a bluetooth model called the puro bt2200 ( $ 99.99 ) . newline_char the headphones were well-liked by both toddlers and tweens , had excellent sound quality , offered some noise cancellation features and adequately restricted volume as long as the cord wasn ’ t used . newline_char most of the other models relied on resistors , which impede electrical currents , inside the cord to reduce volume , but they sometimes failed to work . newline_char both of the overall runners-up were not bluetooth , however ; despite the cords , their maximum volumes did not exceed 85 decibels . story_separator_special_tag there 's no governing board that oversees a staff she says these headphones old clayton to limit the volume to around 85 decibels lad as the fled there . newline_char during their tests had friends that received a poorest rating kid 's gear wired headphones yup . story_separator_special_tag so in order to test how loud the kids headphones could play , we did a set of formal objective sound measurements using audio-testing equipment . newline_char immediately we found a problem : almost all these headphones can produce dangerously high volume if you use them with certain gear . newline_char this problem happens because most of these headphones don ’ t really limit volume but merely reduce it . newline_char active headphones ( in other words , internally powered ones ) such as the puro bt2200 can employ a digital limiter that stops the sound from playing any higher than a certain volume level .
