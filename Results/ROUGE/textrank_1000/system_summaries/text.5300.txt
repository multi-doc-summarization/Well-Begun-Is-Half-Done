though it ’ s unclear whether genetics or other factors are responsible , new study suggests that lethal violence is part of our evolutionary history humans are predisposed to murder each other , new research suggests , although it remains unclear if it ’ s down to genetics or other factors . newline_char researchers from spain have found that a tendency to bump off members of the same species is particularly common among primates , and have estimated that around 2 % of human deaths at the origin of our species were down to such lethal spats . newline_char “ lethal violence is part of our evolutionary history but not carved in stone in ‘ our genes ’ , ” said josé maría gómez , first author of the study from the estación experimental de zonas áridas ( eeza ) in spain . newline_char writing in the journal nature , the team of researchers from four spanish institutions sought to unpick the evolutionary contribution to lethal human violence by looking at how commonly a range of different mammals kill members of the same species . story_separator_special_tag scientists calculated the rate at which more than 1,000 mammal species kill their own kind , and noticed how closely related species have similar rates of lethal violence . newline_char " as a group , mammals average a lethal violence rate against their own of about three killings of their own species in 1,000 deaths . newline_char the " root " violence rate of early humans and many of our closer primate cousins is about 20 in 1,000 , said study lead author jose maria gomez at the university of granada in spain . newline_char on average , modern humans now kill each on a rate of 13 in 1000 , gomez said , basing his calculations on world health organization data .
