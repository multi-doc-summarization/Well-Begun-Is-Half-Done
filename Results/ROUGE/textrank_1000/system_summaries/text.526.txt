eers and abraham clark sought to bring simplicity to the 19th-century burial -- and an added safety feature in case someone was buried alive . story_separator_special_tag a new study reveals how they might have done it : decomposing humans seem to release a singular chemical cocktail , one that scientists might be able to use to better train cadaver dogs and even develop machines that could do the same job . newline_char in 2010 the belgian disaster victim identification team asked analytical chemist eva cuypers and her forensic toxicology lab at the university of leuven in belgium for help finding the best way to train cadaver dogs to pick out human scents . newline_char pig remains in particular have often been used in past decomposition studies because of their similarities to human bodies ( which are often hard to come by ) : they have the same microbes in their  story_separator_special_tag in this study , a validated method using a thermal desorber combined with a gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment during a period of 6 months . newline_char further research in the field with full bodies has to corroborate these results and search for one or more human specific markers . newline_char in this study , we sampled the headspace of 6 human and 26 animal remains that decomposed for 6 months . newline_char this study was conducted in glass jars in laboratory environment to pre-concentrate and therefore easily sample the released vocs . newline_char these samples were collected and analyzed with a validated method using thermal desorber combined with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( td-gc/ms ) [ 12 ] .
