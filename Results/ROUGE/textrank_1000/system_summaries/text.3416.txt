esident obama incessantly claims energy open-mindedness , insisting that his policy is “ all of the above. newline_char this has been accompanied by a gold rush of natural gas production resulting from new fracking technology that has nothing at all to do with obama . newline_char ” the “ only solution , ” he averred in yet another major energy speech last week , is that “ we start using less — that lowers the demand , prices come down. story_separator_special_tag thus mitt romney claims that gasoline prices are high not because of saber-rattling over iran , but because president obama won ’ t allow unrestricted drilling in the gulf of mexico and the arctic national wildlife refuge . newline_char the irony here is that these claims come just as events are confirming what everyone who did the math already knew , namely , that u.s. energy policy has very little effect either on oil prices or on overall u.s. employment . newline_char for the truth is that we ’ re already having a hydrocarbon boom , with u.s. oil and gas production rising and u.s. fuel imports dropping . newline_char if there were any truth to drill-here-drill-now , this boom should have yielded substantially lower gasoline prices and lots of new jobs . newline_char the combination of horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing of shale and other low-permeability rocks has opened up large reserves of oil and natural gas to production . newline_char the reality is that far from being hobbled by eco-freaks , the energy industry has been given a largely free hand to expand domestic oil and gas production , never mind the environment . newline_char photo strange to say , however , while natural gas prices have dropped , rising oil production and a sharp fall in import dependence haven ’ t stopped gasoline prices from rising toward $ 4 a gallon .
