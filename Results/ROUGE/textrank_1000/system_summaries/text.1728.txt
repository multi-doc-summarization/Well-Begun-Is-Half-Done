new genomic study , published today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , offers up strong evidence that domesticated dogs originated in central asia , around modern day nepal and mongolia . newline_char previous genetic studies of dog lineages have concluded that domestication occurred in southern china around 16,500 years ago , but the earliest archaeological evidence of domesticated canines is found in europe and siberia . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag dogs became man ’ s best friends somewhere in central asia close to nepal and mongolia , according to the largest genetic study yet . newline_char “ this is the first global study of genomic patterns of dog diversity , ” says adam boyko of cornell university in ithaca , new york , who led the team . newline_char advertisement the team broke new ground by analysing dna samples from so-called “ village dogs ” , which have lived alongside humans throughout the world since dogs first evolved from wolves and were domesticated around 15,000 years ago . newline_char ” village dogs therefore carry a more authentic genetic signature of original dog populations than the modern-day breeds created in the past 200 years , mainly in europe . story_separator_special_tag cornell university 's dr adam boyko and his colleagues studied 4,676 purebred dogs from recognised breeds , as well as 549 " village dogs " - free-ranging animals that live around human settlements . newline_char they hitched themselves to us , which was a pretty good gamble as it turned out dr adam boyko , cornell university this latter group are the least studied , yet represent a crucial piece in the picture of modern dog diversity . newline_char " the fact that we looked at so many village dogs from so many different regions , we were able to narrow in on the patterns of diversity in these indigenous dogs , " dr boyko told bbc news .
