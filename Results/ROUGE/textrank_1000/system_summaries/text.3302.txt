d that may be the case with a recent feud between iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and supreme leader ali khamenei . newline_char paradoxically , the hard-line president , notorious for his anti-israel rhetoric , would also like to take credit for a deal that eases iran ’ s isolation and opens the way for greater contact and cooperation with the west . story_separator_special_tag close allies of iran 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , have been accused of using supernatural powers to further his policies amid an increasingly bitter power struggle between him and the country 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei . newline_char several people said to be close to the president and his chief of staff , esfandiar rahim mashaei , have been arrested in recent days and charged with being " magicians " and invoking djinns ( spirits ) . newline_char ayatollah mesbah yazdi , a hardline cleric close to khamenei , warned that disobeying the supreme leader – who has the ultimate power in iran – is equivalent to " apostasy from god " . newline_char but the feud has taken a metaphysical turn following the release of an iranian documentary alleging the imminent return of the hidden imam mahdi – the revered saviour of shia islam , whose reappearance is anticipated by believers in a manner comparable to that with which christian fundamentalists anticipate the second coming of jesus . newline_char conservative clerics , who say that the mahdi 's return can not be predicted , have accused a " deviant current " within the president 's inner circle , including mashaei , of being responsible for the film . newline_char since ahmadinejad 's return this week , at least 25 people , who are believed to be close to mashaei , have been arrested .
