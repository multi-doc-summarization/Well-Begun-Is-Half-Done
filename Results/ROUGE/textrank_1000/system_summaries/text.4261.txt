ientists from imperial college believe that intelligence may be influenced by two networks of genes , possibly controlled by a master regulatory system british scientists believe they have made a huge step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms of human intelligence . newline_char but michael johnson of imperial college london , a consultant neurologist and colleagues report in nature neuroscience that they may have discovered a very different answer : two networks of genes , perhaps controlled by some master regulatory system , lie behind the human gift for lateral thinking , mental arithmetic , pub quizzes , strategic planning , cryptic crosswords and the ability to laugh at limericks . newline_char but the scientists raise the distant possibility that armed with the new information they may be able to devise ways to modify human intelligence . newline_char gene linked to long life also protects against mental decline in old age read more it assessed a range of cognitive abilities – among them memory , attention , processing speed and reasoning – and then it combined the results with genetic information donated by healthy people who had taken iq tests , and from people with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability . newline_char they found that the genes that influenced the intelligence and ability of healthy people were the same ones that impaired cognitive ability and caused epilepsy when mutated . newline_char if researchers understand what may go wrong in the interplay of inheritance that delivers human reasoning or memory , they might – the possibility for the moment is only theoretical – be able to devise new ways to deliver help . story_separator_special_tag by studying groupings of people both with and without depression in this way they hope to be able to identify its causes and mechanisms , which can be used in the quest for diagnostic tests and new therapies .
