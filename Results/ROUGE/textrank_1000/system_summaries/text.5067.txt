tory_separator_special_tag in a comprehensive six-year study of the mammalian family tree , scientists have identified and reconstructed what they say is the most likely common ancestor of the many species on the most abundant and diverse branch of that tree — the branch of creatures that nourish their young in utero through a placenta . newline_char o ’ leary of stony brook university on long island , a leader of the project and the principal author of the journal report , wrote that a combination of genetic and anatomical data established that the ancestor emerged within 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great dying at the end of the cretaceous period . story_separator_special_tag in a paper published this week in the journal science , an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data , as well as dna evidence , to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals . newline_char the scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago — a concept at odds with some current thinking . newline_char estimates based on dna , or so-called molecular evidence , suggest that placental mammals appeared in the mid-cretaceous period when dinosaurs like tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops still trod the earth . newline_char however , scientists have yet to uncover evidence of placental fossils during this period , according to the authors of the new study . newline_char using a vast online database called morphobank , the team of 23 scientists built a composite of the hypothetical ancestor based on the morphology , or appearance , of existing and extinct animals , along with the dna data .
