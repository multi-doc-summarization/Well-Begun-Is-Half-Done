nce battles usually have a place and a date , it would be nice to import this data into a data design in nodegoat and visualise these battles through time and space ( diachronic geospatiality ftw ) . newline_char if we select all the battles that have a location and a date , we are left with 410 battles . newline_char this query does not take into account that the location may be stored on a deeper level ( as these battles may have a ‘ place ’ that has a location ) and that the date may be stored as a ‘ start time ’ and ‘ end time ’ . newline_char to take this into account , we use the following query : prefix wd : < http : //www.wikidata.org/entity/ > prefix wdt : < http : //www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/ > prefix rdfs : < http : //www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema # > select ? newline_char coordinates ( concat ( str ( day ( ? newline_char date ) ) , " - " , str ( month ( ? newline_char date ) ) , " - " , str ( year ( ? newline_char eventually we gathered 2657 battles that have both a location and a date . newline_char after a bit of cleaning ( you can do this in open refine , or even in libreoffice calc or excel ) , we 've imported this set into nodegoat : you can use the timeline to scroll through time . newline_char so we queried the dbpedia sparql-endpoint to see what battles they have in store . newline_char of these , 4022 have date and location properties . newline_char ? battle dbo : date ? newline_char } if we look a level deeper for dates and locations we get 10116 battles that have a place and a date reference . story_separator_special_tag
