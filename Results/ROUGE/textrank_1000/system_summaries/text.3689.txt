aching adequate shelter rapidly could save between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals from fatal exposure in the event of a single , low-yield detonation , said the study published in proceedings of the royal society a . story_separator_special_tag people living within about 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) of a small-scale nuclear attack have up to half an hour to seek out adequate shelter safely , as long as travel time to that shelter is no more than 15 minutes away , according to a recent report on the optimal escape strategies for small-scale nuclear explosions . newline_char [ the top 10 largest explosions ever ] the best way to protect against the radioactive dust and ash of nuclear fallout is to seek shelter underground , but more than 20 percent of u.s. households do not have basements , according to a 2009 survey from the u.s. energy information administration . newline_char , conducted mathematical analyses based on existing data on the threats induced by small-scale nuclear explosions to streamline rules people can abide by to protect themselves from fallout . newline_char underground concrete shelters are best , as they put the largest amount of mass between a person and fallout , but the core of large buildings — such as large offices or schools — can also provide adequate shelter , dillon said . newline_char through his analyses , dillon determined that people within poor-quality shelters can reduce radiation poisoning by staying within those shelters for only up to 30 minutes after the detonation before seeking out adequate shelter , as long as that shelter is reachable within 15 minutes . newline_char people do not need to do much to protect themselves against radiation while in transit , since the fallout can largely be rinsed off once a person seeks refuge .
