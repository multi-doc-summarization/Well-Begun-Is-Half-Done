ick image above to view graphic although the prospect of a pill for alzheimer 's remains a long way off , the landmark british study provides a major new pathway for future drug treatments . newline_char the compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases , which shuts down the production of essential proteins , leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off . newline_char it was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as alzheimer 's or parkinson 's . newline_char in mice with prion 's disease , it restored proteins to protect brain cells “ stopping the disease in its tracks ” , restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss . newline_char although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice , including weight loss and mild diabetes , which was caused by damage to the pancreas , professor mallucci said it would “ not be impossible ” to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been “ very promising ” . story_separator_special_tag scientists are hailing a landmark british study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's by stopping the death of neurons . newline_char but this research , published in the journal science translational medicine , targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins . newline_char lead scientist professor giovanna mallucci , from the mrc toxicology unit , said : " we were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells , restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice .
