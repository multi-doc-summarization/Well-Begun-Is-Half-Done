u 'd never need this level of precision for getting to work on time , but the clock could be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems , said study co-author andrew ludlow , researcher at the national institute of standards and technology in boulder , colorado . newline_char the rate of ticking of this timepiece -- known informally ( and awkwardly ) as the ytterbium optical lattice clock -- does not change by more than one part in 10^18 , ludlow said . newline_char in this model , the excitation and de-excitation of an electron corresponds to a pendulum swinging right to left , but in an atomic clock , the " tick " denotes an unimaginably tiny fraction of a second . newline_char but the new atomic clock at nist , described in the science study , uses a different element : ytterbium , atomic number 70 . story_separator_special_tag a pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has set a new record for stability . newline_char " the stability of the ytterbium lattice clocks opens the door to a number of exciting practical applications of high-performance timekeeping , " nist physicist and co-author andrew ludlow says . newline_char the large number of atoms is key to the clocks ' high stability . newline_char one key benefit of the very high stability of the ytterbium clocks is that precise results can be achieved very quickly . newline_char for example , the current u.s. civilian time standard , the nist-f1 cesium fountain clock , must be averaged for about 400,000 seconds ( about five days ) to achieve its best performance . newline_char the new ytterbium clocks achieve that same result in about one second of averaging time .
