tory_separator_special_tag a retreat under fire chief slabinski ’ s team was ordered to establish an observation post on top of the mountain , takur ghar , during operation anaconda , an effort to encircle and destroy qaeda forces in the shah-i-kot valley in eastern afghanistan , about 25 miles from pakistan . newline_char chief slabinski ’ s plan was to land by helicopter near the base of the 10,000-foot mountain around midnight and climb up stealthily , but a series of delays involving aircraft left no time to do that before dawn . newline_char , the five remaining seals and sergeant chapman returned to the top — later called “ roberts ridge ” — on another helicopter to try to rescue petty officer roberts . newline_char rushing through thigh-deep snow , sergeant chapman charged ahead of chief slabinski , and they killed two fighters in a bunker — a hole dug in the ground under a tree — before the airman was wounded . newline_char chief slabinski ’ s plan , he said , was to take cover and let a circling air force gunship hammer the qaeda fighters before trying again to seize the peak and recover sergeant chapman ’ s body . newline_char andrew milani of the army , wrote later that an air force gunship had failed to detect the militants on the mountaintop and that the seals had “ violated a basic tenet of reconnaissance ” by landing directly on their observation post instead of hiking up to it . newline_char colonel milani ’ s investigation remains classified , but an unclassified paper that he wrote in 2003 offered two possible explanations : the qaeda fighters had become confused and were firing at one another , or sergeant chapman , still alive , had resumed fighting .
