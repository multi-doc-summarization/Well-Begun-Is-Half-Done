hoo shareholders meeting astoundingly boring with the exception of a lone crass question from an elderly shareholder who should know better , yahoo ’ s annual meeting — the first under marissa mayer , the fourth ceo to run the company in the last five years — was largely an uneventful affair . newline_char as expected , yahoo shareholders re-elected all directors who stood for re-election and endorsed the company ’ s executive compensation plan . newline_char and , as expected , mayer talked up the progress the company has made since she took the top job last july . newline_char the most visible evidence of that is a spike in mobile users since the spring redesign of mobile email and yahoo ’ s flickr photo-sharing service . newline_char according to mayer , yahoo mobile email usage has increased 70 percent since it was overhauled in april , and photo uploads via the flickr mobile app have risen 50 percent since its redesign last month . newline_char “ we want to build products that delight and inspire , because all of our growth starts with users , ” said mayer . story_separator_special_tag here 's the latest reason it 's kinda sucky being the ceo of a public company . newline_char at yahoo 's shareholder meeting , a scuzzy shareholder said to marissa mayer , " i 'm greek and i 'm a dirty old man , and you look attractive . newline_char gross . newline_char she deflected those questions , saying she was there to talk about yahoo . story_separator_special_tag but first , he 'd like to tell you , and all yahoo present shareholders , that he 's attracted to the company 's ceo . newline_char yep , this was just as gross to listen to as we thought it 'd be . newline_char mayer does a great job of ignoring dirty george .
