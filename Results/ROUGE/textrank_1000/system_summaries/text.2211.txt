re we use the genetic ancestry profiles produced from bayesian analysis , in combination with regional allele frequencies , to select s. newline_char supplementary table s1 shows the bayesian ancestry profiles for the genotypes originally analyzed by knight and goddard17 : the inferred sub-populations common in each regions are noted and the genotypes selected for use in this study are highlighted . newline_char the allele frequencies within each regional population are shown in supplementary table s2 with the alleles harbored by the selected genotypes in this analysis highlighted . newline_char rather , we included those genotypes harboring the more common alleles in each region : genotypes selected ensured that the average proportion of each population that harbored the represented alleles was no lower than 60 % ( supplementary table s2 ) . story_separator_special_tag the previously overlooked vintner , a type of yeast called saccharomyces cerevisiae , makes a “ small but significant ” contribution to a wine ’ s flavour and taste , scientists reported in the journal scientific reports . newline_char “ i was surprised that we detected any signal at all from these geographically different yeast populations in the aroma profile of the wine — i thought we would not , ” co-author matthew goddard of the university of lincoln in england told afp . newline_char for the study , the team first showed genetic differences between populations of s. newline_char cerevisiae found in sauvignon blanc grapes in six major wine-growing regions of new zealand . story_separator_special_tag now , researchers in auckland , new zealand , have confirmed that at least one aspect of terroir—local differences in yeast strains—does indeed alter the outcome of sauvignon blanc fermentation . newline_char ” goddard ’ s auckland-based team first identified and isolated the six major related strains of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae present at each of six new zealand wine-producing regions .
