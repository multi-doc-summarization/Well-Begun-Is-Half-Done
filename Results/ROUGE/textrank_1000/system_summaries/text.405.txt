card had prevailed at trial , he could have recouped as much as $ 303 million , in addition to the $ 83 million the mets â€™ owners were already ordered to pay . newline_char legal experts said the settlement would most likely embolden other defendants who are fighting accusations brought by the trustee . story_separator_special_tag what happened : the owners of the new york mets have settled with trustee irving picard for $ 162 million , their alleged profit from certain ponzi scheme funds in the six years before bernard madoff 's arrest . newline_char that 's because , as part of the settlement , the wilpons will be able to apply to the trustee to be reimbursed for $ 178 million in losses from certain funds . newline_char obviously , like any victims of madoff 's ponzi scheme , they wo n't recover every dollar . newline_char as a result , the wilpons ' actual payment to picard -- once the wilpons ' loser funds are reimbursed like other victims -- should be a fraction of the actual $ 162 million settlement . newline_char that 's a net of only $ 73 million remaining to pay picard to satisfy the settlement . newline_char rakoff previously had decided that picard likely was entitled to at least $ 83.3 million in profits from the two years before madoff 's arrest . newline_char the original suit was for $ 1 billion , but it was reduced by rakoff , who decided that picard could only recover money from the wilpons from the immediate two years before madoff 's arrest , not the six years picard advocated . newline_char the settlement , while not overturning rakoff 's decision , does establish for the trustee six years as an acceptable period to recover profits .
