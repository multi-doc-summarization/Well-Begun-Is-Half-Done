r the study , the researchers had 36 participants sit in a temperature-controlled room and watch videos of actors placing one of their hands in either visibly steaming water , ice water , or neutral still water . newline_char each subject watched ten total videos , four each featuring warm and cold water with different actors who used either their left or right hand , as well as two control videos . newline_char while watching the warm and neutral videos did not produce any changes in subjects ' hand temperature , watching the cold videos caused a small , but unmistakable drop . story_separator_special_tag volunteers who watched videos of people putting their hands in cold water found their own body temperature drop significantly . newline_char ” for the research , which was published in the journal plos one , 36 participants each watched eight videos of actors putting their hands in either visibly warm or cold water . story_separator_special_tag results showed that watching a video of an individual experiencing cold caused a slight , yet undeniable temperature drop in the participants ’ hands . story_separator_special_tag participants ' own hands also showed a significant temperature-dependent effect : hands were significantly colder when observing cold vs. newline_char warm videos f ( 1,34 ) = 13.83 , p = 0.001 with post-hoc t-test demonstrating a significant reduction in participants ' own left ( t ( 35 ) = −3.54 , p = 0.001 ) and right ( t ( 35 ) = −2.33 , p = 0.026 ) hand temperature during observation of cold videos but no change to warm videos ( p > 0.1 ) . newline_char thirty-six healthy participants ( age ; 22.9±3.1 yrs ) each observed , then rated , eight purpose-made videos ( 3 min duration ) that depicted actors with either their right or left hand in visibly warm ( warm videos ) or cold water ( cold videos ) .
