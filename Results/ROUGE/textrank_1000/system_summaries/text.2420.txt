inichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan , has tried to prove the abc conjecture , a long-standing pure maths problem , but now says fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work . newline_char in 2012 mochizuki posted a 500-page paper online that claimed to solve the puzzle , but it required a dense framework of new maths dubbed " inter-universal teichmüller theory " that even experienced mathematicians found difficult to follow . newline_char mochizuki is a highly-respected mathematician and his work is taken seriously , says minhyong kim of the university of oxford , but in the years since he posted the proof no one has been able to give a definitive answer on whether it is correct . newline_char he has also criticised the rest of the community for not studying his work in detail , and says most other mathematicians are " simply not qualified " to issue a definitive statement on the proof unless they start from the very basics of his theory . story_separator_special_tag there were two problems however – the first one , that it ’ s a 500 page paper , and the second ( and more important one ) , that it uses a dense framework of new maths created by him and dubbed “ inter-universal teichmüller theory ” – a framework that has even experience mathematicians struggling . newline_char now , he has released a report in which he says that mathematicians working with him studying his theory have yet to find a flaw , but he criticized the community , saying that most researchers are “ simply not qualified ” to issue a definitive statement on the proof because they don ’ t truly understand his theory – and haven ’ t tried hard enough .
