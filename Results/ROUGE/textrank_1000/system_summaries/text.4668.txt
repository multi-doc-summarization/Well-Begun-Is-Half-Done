e actual creature was probably no more than a millimetre in size researchers have discovered the earliest known ancestor of humans - along with a vast range of other species . newline_char the research team says that saccorhytus is the most primitive example of a category of animals called " deuterostomes " which are common ancestors of a broad range of species , including vertebrates ( backboned animals ) . story_separator_special_tag researchers have identified traces of what they believe is the earliest known prehistoric ancestor of humans – a microscopic , bag-like sea creature , which lived about 540 million years ago . newline_char if the conclusions of the study , published in the journal nature , are correct , then saccorhytus was the common ancestor of a huge range of species , and the earliest step yet discovered on the evolutionary path that eventually led to humans , hundreds of millions of years later . newline_char simon conway morris , professor of evolutionary palaeobiology and a fellow of st john ’ s college , university of cambridge , said : “ we think that as an early deuterostome this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species , including ourselves . story_separator_special_tag the creature is so novel , it has its own family ( saccorhytidae ) , as well as its own genus and species ( saccorhytus coronaries ) , named for its wrinkled , sac-like body . newline_char [ 7 theories on the origin of life ] " we think that as an early deuterostome , this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species , including ourselves , " simon conway morris , a professor of evolutionary palaeobiology at the university of cambridge , said in a statement .
