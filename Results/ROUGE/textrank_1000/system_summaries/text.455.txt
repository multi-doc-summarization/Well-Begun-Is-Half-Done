 have identified 20 key outcrops at extension-corrected distances of ~30â€“150 km to the east and west of the silver creek caldera ( fig . newline_char to the west of the caldera these include various volcanic , granitoid and metamorphic rocks that were present essentially in and on alluvial fans and also on local highlands at the time of eruption19 , 22 . story_separator_special_tag when this supervolcano erupted 18.8 million years ago , it flooded parts of all three states with river-like currents of hot ash and gas called pyroclastic flows . newline_char the new study suggests that pyroclastic flows from the ancient eruption took the form of slow , dense currents -- and not fast-moving jets as some experts previously thought . newline_char the research combines recent laboratory experiments with field data from the 1980s -- some of it captured in colorful kodachrome slides -- to show that the rivers of ash and gas emanating from the silver creek caldera likely traveled at modest speeds of about 10 to 45 miles per hour . newline_char " intuitively , most of us would think that for the pyroclastic flow to go such an extreme distance , it would have to start off with a very high speed , " says study co-author olivier roche . story_separator_special_tag when a supervolcano like yellowstone erupts , residents may have a few hours to escape once the disaster has started , a new study suggests . newline_char " it 's really interesting how you can have such a violent eruption producing such slow-moving flows , " said valentine , co-author of the new study . story_separator_special_tag that idea is based on what we can see from these flows at smaller eruptions , where they race down the sides of the volcano at speeds over 500 kilometers per hour ( 300 mph ) .
