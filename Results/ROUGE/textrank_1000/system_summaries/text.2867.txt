 extremely bright gentleman by the name of daniel perlman set his sights on improving the wine bottle , and seems to have succeeded wildly by inventing a wine bottle that doesn ’ t drip when pouring . newline_char perlman , an inventor and patent holder who also happens to be a biophysicist at brandeis university , studied how wine hugs the edge of bottle spouts after being poured . newline_char perlman figured out that by adding one small groove around the lip of the bottle opening he could change the behavior of the liquid at the end of the pour . newline_char the grooved tip is just two millimeters wide , but a video showing perlman ’ s alteration in action shows just how well it really works in comparison to the original , very basic wine bottle design . newline_char according to brandeis university , perlman is currently shopping his invention to wine bottle manufacturers who may adopt the idea . story_separator_special_tag but a brandeis university physicist believes he has solved the problem – and all it took was a two millimeter tweak in the bottle itself . newline_char according to the school , the modern wine bottle design has been around since the 1800s , meaning it was ripe for innovation – and hopefully an end to 200 years of drips . newline_char this small circular groove , only two millimeters in width , is apparently enough to prevent wine from heading towards a pourer ’ s hand instead of the glass . newline_char however , in fixing the bottle itself , perlman does create one major hurdle to bringing his solution to the masses : unlike an accessory , which anyone can purchase , perlman ’ s innovation would have to be built-in by bottle manufacturers . newline_char “ perlman is currently speaking with bottle manufacturers about adopting his design , ” brandeis writes .
