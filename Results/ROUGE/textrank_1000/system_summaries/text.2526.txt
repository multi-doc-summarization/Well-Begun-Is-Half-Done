sa scientists have determined via an innovative satellite technique that a certain type of wildfire in the amazon rainforest is responsible for destroying several times more forest than that lost through deforestation in regards to recent years . newline_char " amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton of nasa 's goddard space flight center and the study 's lead author said in a press release . newline_char fires in the amazon 's savanna areas can burn quickly , spreading up to 330 feet per minute , according to the researchers , with grasses and shrubs in these ecosystems typically surviving low-intensity surface fires . newline_char " as an answer , the researchers point to climate as the reason that fire-driven deforestation didn ; t burn more surrounding forests in these years as frequent understory fire activity coincided with low nighttime humidity , as measured by the atmospheric infrared sounder ( airs ) instrument aboard nasa 's aqua satellite . story_separator_special_tag these fires destroy several times more forest than is taken out by deforestation each year , according to a new study , published recently in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b . newline_char " amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton , a researcher at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , md.
