four years ago , a chemistry professor got a text from her grad student : if i 'm not back in a week , cut me from the doctoral program . charlotta turner called him right away : " he was very sad and crying , ” the 48-year-old prof at lund university in sweden tells nbc news . " i could hear that the situation was hopeless and they had to flee . " the student , firas jumaah , was visiting his native iraq to help family members during a brutal 2014 isis attack targeting yazidis—a religious minority that includes his family . the terror group had just enslaved and massacred yazidis by the thousand in nearby sinjar . now jumaah and family were planning to flee to the mountains . " i had no hope at all , " says jumaah , per the local . " i was desperate . " but turner took action . she spoke to lund university 's then-security chief , who contacted a company that sent mercenaries into northern iraq . only days later , four armed mercs on two landcruisers blazed into the place where jumaah was hiding , and rushed him to erbil airport with his wife and two young kids . " i have never felt so privileged , so vip , " he says . " but at the same time i felt like a coward as i left my mother and sisters behind me . " seeing his colleagues back in sweden , he was speechless : " i just cried , " he says . yet jumaah finished his phd and found work at a malmo pharmaceuticals company , and his family survived . the bill : roughly 60,000 kroner ( $ 6,613 ) , which his family has nearly finished paying . “ if they told me to pay 200,000 kronor , i would , ” says jumaah . ( the un is finding fresh isis horrors . )
