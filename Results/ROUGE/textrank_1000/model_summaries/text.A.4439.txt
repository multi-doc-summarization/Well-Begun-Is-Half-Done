rahm emanuel sounds like he wants out of the obama administration—and washington altogether . in an interview with charlie rose last night , emanuel confirmed the rumor that he 's considering running for mayor of chicago in 2011 . “ i hope mayor daley seeks reelection . i will work and support him ” if he does , ” he said . “ but if mayor daley does n't , one day i would like to run for mayor … that 's always been an aspiration of mine. ” “ i want to run for office again , ” he said , saying he 'd missed the contact he 'd had with constituents in the house . but chicago is n't exactly rolling out the welcome mat . “ that makes him one of many who aspire to the same goal , ” a richard daley spokesman tells the chicago sun-times . but hizzoner 's brother , william daley , was more blunt last month , saying emanuel would have to “ get in line. ” you can read a transcript of emanuel 's remarks at the huffington post .
