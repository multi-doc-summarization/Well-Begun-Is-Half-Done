a blueprint outlining the path toward a final deal between western countries and iran on its nuclear program was drafted yesterday , and politico notes " there was much for obama officials " and their partner countries to " be happy about , " such as more centrifuge disassembling than previously anticipated . but there are still tenuous points that need to be fleshed out and an american public that needs convincing , and a congressional committee intends to create a bipartisan bill on april 14 that would demand congressional review of any deal , the new york times notes . an aide for speaker john boehner tells abc news that " a wait-and-see until june 30 " ( the deadline for a full agreement ) approach is n't in the cards , while sen. bob corker tells the times " we want the right to go through the details of the deal and to decide whether we believe congressionally mandated sanctions should be alleviated . " keeping the agreement 's framework shaky is the lack of detailed schedules and logistics on certain key points , including nuclear r & d and a uranium-reduction program , politico notes . the bill would insist on a full review of all agreement text , ban the removal of sanctions for 60 days after a final deal is reached , and mandate that the president check up on iran 's compliance every 90 days , the times notes . but while lawmakers on both sides are touting compromise , there are still the hardballers . " i plan â€¦ to stop this deal from going forward , " sen. tom cotton , author of the recent open letter to iran , tells abc . meanwhile , democrat rep. adam schiff says , " the last thing we want is for the international community to think that we came this close to a negotiated end to iran 's nuclear program and the united states congress got in the way .
