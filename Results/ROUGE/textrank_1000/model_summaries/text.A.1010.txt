south korea has taken the unusual step of publicly speaking about plans to assassinate kim jong un and other north korean leaders in the event of conflict . after north korea 's latest nuclear test , south korean defense minister song young moo told lawmakers that he was speeding up the creation of a " decapitation unit " capable of crossing the border for nighttime missions against north korean facilities and its " wartime command , " the new york times reports . officials say the special forces unit , which will apparently be comprised of members of the " spartan 3000 " unit , will be capable of striking anywhere in the korean peninsula within 24 hours . song has said he wants to have the unit ready by the end of the year . the creation of the unit is part of south korea 's " massive punishment and retaliation " plan for possible war with the north , vox reports . analysts say that by disclosing facts about the " decapitation unit , " seoul appears to want to make pyongyang nervous enough to think twice about its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table . " the best deterrence we can have , next to having our own nukes , is to make kim jong un fear for his life , " says retired gen. shin won sik , formerly the south korean military 's chief strategist . president trump , meanwhile , said tuesday that tough new sanctions are " no big deal " compared to " what ultimately will have to happen " to north korea , cnn reports .
