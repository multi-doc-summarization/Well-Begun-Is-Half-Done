stephen colbert 's well-covered joke about president trump , vladimir putin , and oral sex has netted more than 5,700 complaints to the fcc since the may 1 episode of the late show . upon request from politico , the fcc released the first 100 of those complaints , which center on hate speech , indecency , and homophobia and come from both liberals and conservatives . one viewer was thankful their " children , elderly parents , and other loved ones " did n't hear the joke . another told the fcc : " it is your job to keep these leftists from dragging this nation further into the gutter . " most of the complaints advocated for a fine against colbert . fcc chairman ajit pai says they are reviewing the complaints , but that does n't mean the complaints have merit . a lawyer tells politico there 's " zero chance " the fcc brings an obscenity case against colbert and a " less than zero chance " such a case would be a success . colbert is also unlikely to face punishment from cbs . both the late-night host and network chairman les moonves joked about the situation during a cbs upfront presentation wednesday in new york , the los angeles times reports . " there 's only one word to describe this president , and the fcc has asked me not to use it anymore , " colbert said following a song-and-dance number . moonves added the late show is very popular with " fcc investigators 18 to 49 .
