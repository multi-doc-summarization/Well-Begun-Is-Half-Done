" obviously , this has gotten out of hand and can not be repeated , " wrote brig . gen. dana born to school administrators . just how does the ritual turn into a massive melee ? when " upperclassmen defending the first sergeant " begin brawling with " the four degrees trying to capture the first sergeant , " wrote born , according to the air force times . but a new commander at the school says he may allow the sergeant-tossing to continue if cadets can do it nicely . " our air force expects better , " says brig . gen. greg lengyel . " i expect better , and i ’ m confident the cadets will learn and grow from this . "
