three inmates who famously escaped from alcatraz prison in 1962 may not be so dead after all . in fact , new evidence that they survived has spawned a history channel special and inspired a retired us marshal to revive the investigation , the new york post reports . " this is absolutely the best actionable lead we ’ ve had , " says the ex-marshal , art roderick . to recap , three alcatraz inmates—frank morris along with brothers john and clarence anglin—escaped by chiseling a hole into a prison wall and jumping into the cold san francisco bay , with homemade paddles and a raft made from raincoats . never found , they were presumed dead . but two nephews of the anglins have produced evidence to the contrary : they have christmas cards signed in the names of john and clarence anglin , and roderick matched the handwriting . but the cards are neither stamped nor dated . a photo that will be seen on the show , alcatraz : search for the truth , " proves the anglins may have been alive in the 1970s , " says the post . and dna from the dug-up remains of another anglin brother , alfred , does not genetically match a set of bones found on a shore near san francisco in 1963 . in a letter , former boston mobster whitey bulger says he met the three men in alcatraz and gave them advice about navigating currents in the bay . " he taught them that when you disappear , you have to cut all ties , " says one of the nephews , ken widner . " he told me , 'these brothers undoubtedly had done exactly what i told them to do . ' " sadly , variety did n't think much of the history channel special , calling it " overproduced , from the pounding music to the dramatic recreations . " ( a study found that the inmates might have survived if they plunged into the water between 11pm and midnight . )
