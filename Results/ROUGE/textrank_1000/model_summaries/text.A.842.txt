a surprise announcement out of india tuesday night is being called by local media a " surgical strike " against currency corruption that 's infiltrated the nation , the bbc reports . per cnnmoney , india prime minister narendra modi announced that the country 's two largest current bank notes—the 500-rupee note and 1,000-rupee note ( equivalent to about $ 7.50 and $ 15 , respectively ) , which equal about 85 % of the cash currently moving around india—were taken out of circulation in their current incarnation as of midnight tuesday , which the government hopes will lure people out of hiding who 've been stockpiling money without paying taxes on it . the idea is to force them to swap the cash for legit replacement money at banks and post offices before the 50-day deadline for such trades arrives on dec. 30 . experts say there 's a preponderance of this so-called " black money " in india , and by drawing it all out in droves , banks will be able to send up a red flag if people come in with large amounts , possibly helping the government catch tax evaders . there are about 16.5 billion of the 500-rupee bills and 6.7 billion of the higher denomination now in circulation ( atms will be shuttered wednesday and thursday so more notes wo n't be introduced into the flow ) . in place of the now-almost-worthless notes , the government will issue new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes with images of gandhi on them , the wall street journal reports .
