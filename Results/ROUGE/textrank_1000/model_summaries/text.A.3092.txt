here 's how guardian writer oliver burkeman describes a recent interview given by will and jaden smith : " the most bizarre interview in hollywood history , " and one that " will make your brain hurt . " the q & a in question appeared in new york a few days ago , as the father and son promoted their new movie after earth . here 's a relevant excerpt : will : " i ’ m a student of patterns . at heart , i ’ m a physicist . i look at everything in my life as trying to find the single equation , the theory of everything . " jaden : " there 's definitely a theory to everything . ... i think that there is that special equation for everything , but i don ’ t think our mathematics have evolved enough for us to even—i think there ’ s , like , a whole new mathematics that we ’ d have to learn to get that equation . " will : " i agree with that . " jaden : " it ’ s beyond mathematical . it ’ s , like , multidimensional mathematical , if you can sort of understand what i ’ m saying . " will , later : " and , the things about our family that are mysteries or seem strange , when they ’ re explained , it ’ ll be obvious . you know , the forum of media that we ’ re in can ’ t really handle the complexity of things that we say all the time . " if you 're thinking , " well , what do you expect , they 're scientologists , " not so fast . in the same interview , the elder smith says they 're not religious , but are " students of world religion " and " respect all [ religions ] . " he has flat-out denied being a scientologist in the past . ( as for after earth ... it got hilariously terrible reviews . )
