american sniper did n't just set a box-office record this weekend . it also triggered debate among hollywood honchos apparently offended by the flick—who then said they really were n't , usa today reports . seth rogen , for one , tweeted yesterday that the film " kind of reminds me of the movie that 's showing in the third act of inglorious basterds , " a reference to nazi propaganda of a german sniper shooting allied soldiers . but rogen today tweeted , " i just said something 'kinda reminded ' me of something else . i actually liked american sniper . " enter michael moore , who posted : " my uncle killed by sniper in ww2 . we were taught snipers were cowards . will shoot u in the back . snipers are n't heroes . and invaders r worse " that inspired tweets from newt gingrich ( " michael moore should spend a few weeks with isis and boko haram " ) and rob lowe ( " he 's kidding , right ? " ) . so moore wrote a facebook post in which he blamed deadline hollywood and the hollywood reporter for making it seem like " i do n't like " the film . he goes on to laud bradley cooper , the costumes , hair , makeup , and editing , but adds : " oh ... and too bad clint [ eastwood ] gets vietnam and iraq confused in his storytelling . and that he has his characters calling iraqis 'savages ' throughout the film . " fox news reports on an " odd source " of american sniper support—jane fonda—who tweets : " powerful . another view of 'coming home . ' bradley cooper sensational . bravo clint eastwood . " ( see how many calories cooper ate per day to play the part of navy seal chris kyle . )
