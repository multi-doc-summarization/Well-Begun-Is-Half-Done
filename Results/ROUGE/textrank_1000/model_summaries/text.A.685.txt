quick , how many super bowls have there been ? if you do n't know , it 's probably because this year 's game was promoted as super bowl xlviiiâ€”and you 'd be forgiven if your roman numeral skills are rusty . well , good news , my ancient-number-system-challenged friends : in 2016 , the nfl is ditching the letters , abc news reports . the game 's logo will simply say " super bowl 50 . " this is a one-time thing , however . " when we developed the super bowl xl logo , that was the first time we looked at the letter ' l , ' " explains the nfl 's vp of branding . " and , at that moment , that 's when we started to wonder what will happen when we get to 50 ? " after much consideration , the brand team decided that " super bowl l " would look dumb , and so decided to give us a brief roman numeral reprieve . it will be the first super bowl without roman numerals since 1970 's super bowl 4 . but 2017 's game will be super bowl li , notes nbc sports .
