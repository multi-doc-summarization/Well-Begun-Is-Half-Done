" he tells the st. george news that he decided the conical penis—which sparked weeks of complaints from local residents—was " stupid because it looks like a party hat . " ward says he paid $ 130,000 in las vegas for the bull sculpture , which he placed on a perch outside the restaurant . the outrage over the statue 's " party hat , " which led to a petition to revoke the restaurant 's license , was just the latest in a series of disputes between ward and local residents , who accuse him of charging too much for food and having poor business practices , according to the ap . ward counters that his food is some of the best in southern utah and the statue has helped his business .
