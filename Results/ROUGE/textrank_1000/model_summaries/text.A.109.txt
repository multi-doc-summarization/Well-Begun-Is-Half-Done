a longtime tex-mex restaurant in houston has been caught up in the volatile politics of the day , with some calling for a boycott of el tiempo cantina . and it 's all because jeff sessions came to dinner , explains culturemap . after the attorney general ate there friday , the owner posted a since-deleted photo online of his son posing with sessions , saying it had been an " honor " to serve him . those opposed to white house policies on immigration quickly pounced , with calls for a boycott and worse , reports khou . " death threats , " says owner roland laurenzo . the restaurant then posted an apology to those it offended and tried to distance itself from white house policies . " el tiempo does not in [ any way ] support the practice of separating children from parents or any other practices of the government relative to immigration , " laurenzo wrote . " the posting of a photograph of the attorney general at one of our restaurants does not represent us supporting his positions . " of course , that prompted supporters of the white house to join the debate , and now el tiempo is taking flak from both sides . meanwhile , the restaurant 's facebook , instagram , and twitter pages went dark over the weekend , notes the houston chronicle . ( a restaurant in virginia also entered the political fray . )
