a solar plane made aviation history today , and its historic journey is nowhere near over . the solar impulse 2 , controlled by swiss pilot andré borschberg , landed in hawaii after a five-day , 4,000-mile trip over the pacific ocean from japan , reports usa today . the feat is just one leg on a planned around-the-world trip , but the non-stop stretch over the pacific was seen as the most difficult , and dangerous , part of the flight . it set the record for the longest solar-powered flight in terms of both time and distance . waiting to greet borschberg at the kalaeloa airport were his family and his co-pilot , bertrand piccard , who will now fly the plane on its next leg , a 100-hour trip to phoenix . the 62-year-old borschberg had to make do with 20-minute naps in the cramped cockpit over his five-day trip , and at times , he sweated through 100-degree temperatures , reports the guardian . he tweeted along the way , crediting yoga for helping his mental and physical stamina , especially yesterday , when he “ climbed the equivalent altitude of mount everest four times . " cnn explains that the aircraft is covered in 17,000 solar cells , which collect the sun 's rays during the day and allow the plane to fly through the night on battery power .
