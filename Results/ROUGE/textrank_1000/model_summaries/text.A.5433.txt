one of osama bin laden 's sons may have escaped the raid by navy seals , according to abc news and british papers the telegraph and daily mail . it seems more guesswork than anything at this point , though . bin laden 's three widows have reportedly told pakistani authorities that one son has not been seen since the raid . the best guess is that they 're referring to bin laden 's youngest son , hamza , thought to be around 19 or 20 and a close confidante of his father . his mother is one of the detained widows . initial reports had him killed in the raid , but that might have been confusion over the killing of a different son , khalid . in any event , pakistani officials agree that someone appears to be missing . “ we don ’ t know if it was his son , " an unidentified source tells the telegraph . " someone , one person may have been in the compound that we now can not account for if—we believe what we are being told . "
