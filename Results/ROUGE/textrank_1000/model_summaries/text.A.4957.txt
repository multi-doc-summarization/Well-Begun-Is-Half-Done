what do you do with an ex-pope ? if you happen to know , call rome , because the church is n't sure yet . many fear benedict will become an implicit rival to the new pope , despite his apparent desire to keep a low profile . he told roman diocese priests yesterday that he would be " withdrawing into prayer , " reuters reports . " i will always be close to all of you , " he said , " even if i remain hidden from the world . " the " close to you " bit is somewhat literal ; benedict has announced he 'll be living in the vatican . that 's caused some controversy , the wall street journal reports , but one senior papal adviser says it 's " better to have him here than somewhere else , where he could become another center of power . " benedict is likely to exert influence over the next pope by picking a new head of the embattled vatican bank , and he 'll keep writing as a respected theologian . the church also has n't decided what vestments he 'll wear , whether he 'll give audiences , or even what to address him asâ€”a decision that has " juridical " ramifications , a spokesman said . one thing 's for sure : he wo n't be infallible anymore .
