a celebrity chef has spent tens of thousands of dollars to quietly change the name of his manhattan restaurant after he discovered its meaning had racial undertones . per the new york times , tom colicchio , the lead judge on bravo 's top chef , originally called his eatery in the new york city 's financial district fowler & wells , named after publishers samuel wells and brothers lorenzo and orson fowler , whose building rested on the same site as colicchio 's restaurant in the mid-1800s . however , a little digging by colicchio 's team after they 'd already named the restaurant revealed " facts about [ the fowlers ' and wells ' ] beliefs that go against everything we stand for , " per a statement cited by page six . more specifically , the fowlers and wells were advocates of phrenology , the study of the shape and size of the skull , which many in the 19th century believed to be an indicator of one 's mental abilitiesâ€”and which was often used to " prove " african-americans were mentally inferior and to justify slavery ( at least one of the fowler brothers had eyebrow-raising thoughts on this ) . colicchio , who 's an outspoken liberal on social media , said that although his team incorporated the concept of phrenology into the restaurant 's theme ( including on the bar 's menu ) , they did n't initially realize quite how bad the practice 's roots could be . once they made this discovery , they went about coming up with a new name and reworking logos , signage , business cards , and menus to match . the restaurant 's new name : temple court , named after the building it 's housed in .
