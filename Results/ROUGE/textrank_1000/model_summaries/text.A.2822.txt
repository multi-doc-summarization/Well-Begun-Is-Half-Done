facebook plans to begin a roadshow to pitch its stock to investors on monday , clearing the way for an initial public offering on may 18 , sources tell the wall street journal . mark zuckerberg plans to appear at some meetings but other top facebook execs will be handling most of the roadshow , the sources say . the closely-watched ipo is expected to value facebook at up to $ 100 billion and raise up to $ 10 billion , making it the biggest in silicon valley history . " i have not seen as broad-based interest in an ipo since google . investor demand is immense , " an analyst at research firm ipo boutique tells reuters . " i expect a roadshow that will rival all roadshows where investors will be turned away at the door . " but the timing has mystified some analysts , including darcy travlos at forbes , who believes facebook should wait a few months to show investors that slowing revenue growth can be turned around and the company 's $ 1 billion acquisition of instagram was a wise move . " going public now raises the question : is this as good as it gets ? " she notes .
