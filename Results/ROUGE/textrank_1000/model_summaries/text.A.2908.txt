following north korea 's most powerful weapons test yet on sunday , a south korean lawmaker tells cnn his country 's intelligence service believes the north has an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) on the move . things get pretty vague beyond that : he did n't know the method of transport or when the movement was noticed . but reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts , via an unnamed source quoted by south korea â€™ s asia business daily . its source says the icbm started moving monday , is only being moved at night , and is headed toward the nation 's west coast . reuters notes there 's some likelihood that another test could come on or around saturday : sept. 9 is the country 's founding day holiday . cnbc notes north korea conducted a nuke test on sept. 9 , 2016 . two more details that allegedly came from the south 's national intelligence service briefing : word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the north 's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations , and suspicions that the next icbm test firing might be directed toward the north pacific but aimed at a lower angle , which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests , which had more of an upward trajectory . meanwhile , the white house tells reuters it has given " in-principle approval " to a request by south korean president moon jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights , a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the north , if necessary . meanwhile , vladimir putin on tuesday gave his take on the situation : north korea " will eat grass but will not give up the ( nuclear ) program if they do n't feel safe .
