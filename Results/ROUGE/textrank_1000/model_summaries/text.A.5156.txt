the us military will continue to permit transgender individuals to serve openly until defense secretary jim mattis has received president donald trump 's " direction " to change the policy and figured out how to implement it , america 's top military officer said thursday . in a memo to all military service chiefs , commanders , and enlisted military leaders , gen. joseph dunford , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said " there will be no modifications " to current policy for now , amid questions about trump 's announcement on twitter that the us government will not " accept or allow " transgender people to serve in any capacity in the military , the ap reports . " i know there are questions about yesterday 's announcement , " dunford began , adding that nothing would change until the president 's direction has been received by mattis and mattis has issued " implementation guidance . " the dunford statement suggests that mattis was given no presidential direction on changing the transgender policy . mattis has been on vacation this week and has been publicly silent amid questions about trump 's announced ban . his spokesmen declined to comment thursday . on wednesday they said the pentagon would work with the white house and provide revised guidance to the military " in the near future . " dunford himself was not aware that trump was going to announce the ban , a us official said . trump 's announcement caught the pentagon flat-footed and unable to explain what it called trump 's " guidance . " the navy is in sync with dunford 's direction : in an email obtained by usa today , vice adm. robert burke said transgender sailors will not be discharged and will continue to receive medical treatment until the white house issues clear guidance .
