federal officials say postal workers in metro atlanta were n't just delivering mail but also cocaine on behalf of drug traffickers in exchange for bribes as low as $ 250 . when the gavel came down tuesday , a mail clerk and 15 letter carriers had been sentenced to between three and nine years in prison . the scheme first came to light in 2015 during an investigation into a drug trafficking group , which apparently thought postal workers would have a better chance of making the deliveries uncaught , according to the us attorney 's office . federal agents then watched as a confidential source posing as a drug trafficker sought usps employees willing to deliver drugs to specific addresses for bribes , nabbing 16 " corrupt " workers ranging in age from 26 to 64 , per cnn and the atlanta journal constitution . in a statement , prosecutors note defendants negotiated the amount of money they would charge and took additional bribes for packages delivered by other employees they recruited . though usps workers are " typically valuable members of the community , entrusted to deliver the mail every day to our homes , " these 16 individuals " chose to abuse " the public trust and " used their positions to bring what they thought were large amounts of dangerous drugs into those same communities for a quick payoff , " says us attorney byung j. pak . noting the possibility that rival drug traffickers could target usps workers , officials say the scheme also put innocent people at risk . in addition to prison time , the workers were ordered to pay restitution . ( this postal worker stole 6,000 greeting cards . )
