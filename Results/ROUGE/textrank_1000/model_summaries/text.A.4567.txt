donald trump launched what the bbc describes as a " fresh assault on america 's intelligence community " with a tweet tuesday night accusing them of delaying a briefingâ€”and putting " intelligence " in quotes . " the 'intelligence ' briefing on so-called 'russian hacking ' was delayed until friday , perhaps more time needed to build a case , " trump tweeted . " very strange ! " officials , however , tell cnn that the briefing had never been scheduled for tuesday , and even president obama has yet to receive the final report from top intelligence officials on the alleged russian hacking of the presidential election . officials say trump or his team may have mistakenly thought his regular intelligence briefing tuesday would be the russia-related one . a senior intelligence official tells nbc news that the director of national intelligence and heads of the nsa , cia , and fbi are among those scheduled to meet with trump on friday . the washington post reports that senate minority leader chuck schumer called trump 's attitude toward intelligence services " really dumb " tuesday night . " let me tell you , you take on the intelligence community , they have six ways from sunday at getting back at you , " he told rachel maddow . " from what i am told , they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them . " a source tells the post that the report on russian hacking could be on obama 's desk as soon as thursday . a declassified version might be released to the public early next week , the source says . ( at least one trump adviser disagrees with the president-elect 's skepticism . )
