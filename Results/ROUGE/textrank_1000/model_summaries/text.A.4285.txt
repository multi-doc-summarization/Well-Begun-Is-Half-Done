oh , canada , you might have to actually pick a side on this one : it seems that matthew perry recently admitted that he once beat up a kid in elementary school for " excelling in a sport , " and that kid is now the current prime minister of canada , justin trudeau , reports mashable . trudeau responded to the story on saturday , reports tmz , perhaps in the spirit of april fool 's day , tweeting that " i 've been giving it some thought , and you know what , who has n't wanted to punch chandler ? how about a rematch @ matthewperry ? " no response as yet from chandler , er , perry .
