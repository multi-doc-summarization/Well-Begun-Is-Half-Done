parents are often told to swaddle their newborn babies in order to help them sleep , but a new analysis of studies finds that the practice may increase the risk of sids , the new york times reports . researchers looked at four studies that examined a total of 760 cases of sudden infant death syndrome , and found that swaddling ( wrapping a baby tightly in a blanket in order to simulate the feeling of being in the womb , aol reports ) increased the risk for sids by about a third overall . of the babies who died of sids , 17 % were swaddled . the biggest risk was in babies asleep on their stomachs . it was less risky for those sleeping on their sides , and the least risky for those sleeping on their backs . swaddling makes it more difficult for a baby to move , so a baby on his stomach may be more at risk if he is swaddled and his face is pushed into the mattress . the current recommendation is for parents to place babies on their backs to sleep , and the researchers say this is even more important if the baby is swaddled . the researchers also found the risk increased as the age of the babies increased , and as the study notes , it was greatest for babies older than six monthsâ€” " babies start to roll over between four and six months , and that point may be the best time to stop " swaddling , the lead author says . as for babies swaddled and then put to sleep on their backs , researchers did find a " small but significant risk " of sids , the atlantic reports , and that 's likely related to babies who were put to sleep on their backs swaddled , but then rolled over .
