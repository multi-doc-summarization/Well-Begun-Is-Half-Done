earlier this month , aol agreed to sell microsoft 925 patents and patent applications for just north of $ 1 billion ; now another tech giant is getting a piece of the action . facebook has pledged to buy some 650 of those patents , or $ 550 million worth . in the deal , facebook also gets a license to microsoft 's portion of the portfolio . according to facebook 's announcement , microsoft ends up with 275 aol patents , plus licenses to facebook 's aol patents and the 300-ish patents aol did n't sell . " today ’ s agreement with facebook enables us to recoup over half of our costs while achieving our goals from the aol auction , " says a microsoft rep. for facebook , it 's " another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect facebook ’ s interests over the long term , " says a spokesman . what do outsiders say ? " the deal is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company , " writes nick wingfield for the new york times . " it also shows how microsoft and facebook have gravitated increasingly closer to each other in large part because of a common enemy : google . " writing for zdnet , emil protalinski says it 's actually all about yahoo , not google . " with public companies like yahoo targeting it for patent infringement , the social networking giant has stepped up its game . i don ’ t believe it ’ s a coincidence that aol and yahoo are such similar companies . this is exactly why facebook is so interested in aol ’ s patents : a lot of them cover technologies that facebook uses , as well technologies used by companies that want to sue facebook .
