utah 's orrin hatch , the longest-serving republican in the senate , says he wo n't be running for re-election in 2018 . the 83-year-old announced the move on twitter . “ every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves , " he says in a video . " and for me , that time is soon approaching . that ’ s why after much prayer and discussion with family and friends , i ’ ve decided to retire at the end of this term . " the move paves the way for mitt romney , a frequent critic of president trump , to run for his seat . details and developments : unpopular at home : hatch has been in the senate for four decades and currently chairs the powerful finance committee , a post that allowed him to play a big role in the gop 's recent tax overhaul . but his clout does n't seem to matter in utah , where polls show that about 75 % of residents wanted him to retire , reports the salt lake tribune . ( the newspaper itself issued a scathing editorial calling for him to do just that . ) trump unhappy : the president is " very sad " upon hearing the news , says spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders . the new york times reports that the president , pleased with hatch 's work on the tax plan , had been encouraging him to run again . if nothing else , that would keep romney—who has been vocal in his criticism of trump—out of the senate . ( still , trump reportedly considered romney for secretary of state . )
