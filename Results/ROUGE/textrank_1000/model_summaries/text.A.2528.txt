dealing with death is difficult enough , but when a loved one takes his or her own life , it becomes even more complex—and it may up the risk of suicide for those left behind , a new study finds . in their findings published in the bmj open journal , researchers from university college london studied 3,432 adults ages 18 to 40 who 'd been bereaved by a sudden death of a friend or family member . they found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65 % more likely to attempt suicide themselves ( what ndtv refers to as the phenomenon of " suicide contagion " ) than those affected by a loved one 's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment , per a press release . and having someone close to you die by suicide was found to have other repercussions , too : the study discovered that those affected by suicidal deaths were 80 % more likely to leave a work or educational situation , per the release . " our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members , " study author dr. alexandra pitman says in the release . and the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person 's outlook . " suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject , " pitman notes . " avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized , and sometimes even blamed for the death . " that 's not to say , though , that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate . " these outcomes are by no means inevitable , " pitman says . " if you have been bereaved by suicide , you should know that are not alone and support is available . " ( a marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide . )
