acting veterans affairs secretary robert wilkie is president trump 's pick to permanently lead the beleaguered department . wilkie is a former pentagon undersecretary for personnel and readiness , and a former adviser to gop sen. thom tillis of north carolina . he 's led the agency for two months , ever since trump fired david shulkin amid an internal revolt and questions about his compliance with ethics rules , reports the ap . wilkie appeared in the white house press briefing room thursday to accept a check for the amount of trump 's first-quarter salary , which he donated to the agency . trump revealed his decision during a prison reform event at the white house . trump previously nominated white house physician dr. ronny jackson for the job , but jackson withdrew last month . politico sees wilkie 's path to confirmation as much smoother than jackson 's , though it points out one potential wrinkle : wilkie was one of three congressional aides present when trump 's campaign supported ditching a provision in the gop 's 2016 platform that called for tough action against russia . robert mueller 's team is reportedly looking into that campaign decision .
