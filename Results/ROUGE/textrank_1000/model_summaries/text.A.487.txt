the pentagon is digging deeper in its push for new air and space technologies as china threatens to unseat the us as king of the skies . speaking with aerospace experts at the china aerospace studies initiative , deputy defense secretary robert work says the us ' rival is " quickly closing the technological gaps , " per reuters . specifically , china is developing highly advanced radar-evading aircraft , reconnaissance planes , missiles , and electronic warfare equipment , work says , suggesting the us needs to step up its game . that ’ s becoming increasingly difficult , however , as " the margin of technological superiority upon which we have become so accustomed ... is steadily eroding , " work says . " as the department of defense , we 're the hedge force , " he says . " we say , 'look , here are capabilities that we see that the chinese are developing and it 's important for us to be able to counter those . ' " though he doesn ’ t exactly dive into what technologies the pentagon is working on , he says one way we might do that is with directed energy weapons that can shoot down pricey missiles at a low cost . interestingly , work ’ s comments were quickly followed by a xinhua report noting chinese military officials are also boosting development of national defense technology . " the whole of the society should be encouraged to take part in the innovation cause , " a chinese official is quoted as saying . ( tension with china is clear at sea as well as in the skies . )
