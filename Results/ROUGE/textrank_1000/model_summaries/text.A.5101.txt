if you think you 're avoiding artificial sweeteners because you do n't put them in your coffee or tea , think again . these additives are found in everything from yogurt and baked goods to sauces and diet colas , per the cbc , with " a lot of people ... consuming them in foods and not realizing it , " says university of manitoba researcher meghan azad . azad , the co-author of a new study published monday in the canadian medical association journal , also notes that 40 % of adults report using artificial sweeteners on a regular basisâ€”which may prove pointless when it comes to dropping pounds , as her team has found no evidence that the sweeteners help with weight loss and may even cause other health issues . azad 's team conducted a meta analysis of 37 previously published studies of the diets of nearly 407,000 people , only seven of which were randomized control trials . " a lot of the studies we found were observational , meaning they could show a link , but they ca n't prove a cause-and-effect relationship , " she tells ctv news . among the seven more-rigorous trials , regular consumption of artificial sweeteners had no significant effect on weight loss , while among the 30 observational studies , regular consumption was tied to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure , as well as " modest " weight gain . possible reasons for the weight gain , per azad : our bodies may metabolize based on sweetness perception ( not sugar content ) , gut bacteria affected by sweeteners may affect obesity , or we may give ourselves permission to eat more sweets after eating diet products . an internal medicine expert says the studies are n't clear enough to cast all blame on artificial sweeteners ; azad says there is n't enough evidence the sweeteners are " truly harmless . " ( when it comes to higher blood sugar , gut bacteria may play a role . )
