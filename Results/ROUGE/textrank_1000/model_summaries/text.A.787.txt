robert wang has a simple goal : " an instant pot in every kitchen . " and cbc reports the canadian inventor is poised to make significant strides toward that goal this black friday . wang invented the instant pot in 2008 after getting laid off from his software engineering job , according to nbc news . the device is essentially an electric pressure cooker that also serves as a rice cooker , steamer , slow cooker , and more . it has sensors to prevent burning and make sure everything 's cooking properly and bluetooth for remote monitoring . now , seven years after the instant pot hit the market , wang has a legitimate phenomenon on his hands , selling nearly 250,000 units on amazon 's prime day . " to sell 250,000 units in 24 hours is close to a miracle , " wang tells cbc . " it 's like that saying about when the time for an idea has arrived , nothing can stop it . " and the instant pot 's popularity is still growing . it 's predicted it will be amazon 's biggest seller during the company 's black friday sales event in the us and canada this week . wang thinks he 'll move 500,000 units on amazon alone . he chalks the instant pot 's popularity up to people 's growing desire to make healthy , home-cooked food while avoiding fast foodâ€”and because " everything is better with bluetooth . " the inquirer states the instant pot 's biggest innovation is " taking the fear out of pressure-cooking . " whatever the reason for its popularity , instant pot owners are fanatical . the instant pot community on facebook has 750,000 members , and a chef who teaches an instant pot cooking class describes some fans as " cult-like worshippers . " but they probably said the same thing about all those people buying tickle-me elmos .
