it 's legendary , supposedly cursed , admired daily by thousands , and the star of a video game—and yet we do n't know all there is to know about the hope diamond , or so a recent discovery indicates . the 45.52-carat diamond has given up one of its secrets to french mineral scientist françois farges and jeffrey post , the smithsonian 's curator of minerals . their detective work involved computer modeling and a 17th-century lead replica that farges found in 2009 among the national d'histoire naturelle 's collection , and led them to an intriguing conclusion : when king louis xiv possessed the diamond , it was mounted on a gold background and cut in a way that could cause a sun to appear at the blue stone 's center—all too appropriate for the sun king , whose colors were blue and gold , reports smithsonian magazine . louis xiv bought the originally 112 3/16-carat , crudely cut diamond in 1668 from a french merchant who obtained the jewel somewhere in india . five years later it was recut to its 67 1/8-carat size , according to the smithsonian encyclopedia , at which time it became known as the french blue . in the years between its theft ( in 1792 , during the french revolution ) and reappearance ( in 1812 , in britain ) , it was again cut to its current size , obliterating those former dimensions—until farges uncovered the replica , which would have been used by jewelers in need of a stand-in for the actual diamond while creating settings . but the replica made clear that the french blue was cut in an unusual way , eschewing the sharp angles that maximize the reflection of light . in exploring the reasoning behind the cut , farges and post arrived at their conclusion . interestingly , it was only with the discovery of the replica that it was conclusively proven that the french blue and the hope diamond were the same stone .
