the prominent conservative site redstate is now poised to have a decidedly pro-trump vibe . parent company salem media on friday purged a slew of bloggers in a " mass firing , " and many of those who lost their jobs were critics of president trump , reports cnn media writer brian stelter . former editor erick erickson , now at the resurgent , writes that it 's not a huge surprise given that salem similarly got rid of many anti-trump voices at its radio properties . both stories point out that the move was n't entirely political . salem wanted to cut costs ; it 's just that those who bore the brunt of the cuts were generally critical of the president . " they fired everybody who was insufficiently supportive of trump , " one source tells cnn . the daily beast lists some of those fired writers as caleb howe , jay caruso , ben howe , patrick frey ( who writes as patterico ) , neil stevens , and susan wright . caleb howe , for one , sounded ticked about friday 's events . " there is a right way to do something and a f -- -ed up way , " he tweeted .
