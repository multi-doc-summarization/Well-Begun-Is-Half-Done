the fda has ordered 23andme to " immediately discontinue marketing " its genetic testing kits , saying that the company has repeatedly failed to prove the product actually works . the google-backed company offers mail-in genetic testing , which it promises can reveal your risk for various health conditions and drug allergies . in a sharply-worded warning letter addressed to co-founder and ceo anne wojcicki , the fda says it fears false positives could cause consumers to undergo unnecessary procedures , while false negatives could make them miss actual warning signs . the fda says it 's had " more than 14 face-to-face teleconference meetings " and " hundreds of email exchanges , " with the company , and provided " ample detailed feedback " on what it must do . but " we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated the [ test ] for its intended uses . " the company has 15 days to respond , and has released a statement saying it realizes it has n't " met the fda 's expectations regarding timeline and communication . " the case is being carefully watched as a sign for how the fda will deal with genetic testing , experts tell the washington post .
