protesters in egypt have held on to tahrir square after the latest round of clashes with police , which in three days have left 22 dead throughout the country . police burned banners and assaulted a field hospital in a raid beginning last night ; protesters threw pieces of pavement at authorities ; and in unconfirmed internet videos , protesters were beaten with sticks by police , who appeared to toss a body on a heap of trash . an apparent fire in a nearby apartment building left a woman calling for help , but police shot tear gas at those below , reuters reports . though demonstrators were temporarily driven from the square yesterday , they soon returned ahead of another police raid , and the los angeles times reports their ranks grew to 20,000 by midnight . the unrest may complicate the country 's plan to hold its first free parliamentary elections in decades ; the staggered vote is due to begin next monday , though reuters notes that the army will retain its hold on presidential powers until a presidential poll is held , which may not happen until about a year from now ; protesters object to that timeline .
