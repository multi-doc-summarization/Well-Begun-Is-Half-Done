five siblings may have found their long-lost older brother thanks to a facebook post . their mother , 72-year-old geraldine " jerri " kramer , gave birth to a baby in 1963 , when she was 19 and unwed , but the indiana woman 's parents and priest made her give the boy up for adoption . still , she bonded with the infant as soon as she held him , and never stopped thinking about him , she tells abc news . kramer , whose maiden name was hummel , called the baby jack , fox news reports . he remained a secret from much of her family , even the husband she married in 1966 . but in 1988 , when her oldest daughter was considering giving up a child for adoption , kramer told her the story and warned her daughter she 'd regret parting with the baby . then , as her health started to decline , kramer asked her kids to help her find her own lost child . the five of them took a group photo on thanksgiving and added the words , " you were born 6-10-63 . you 're our older brother , we 're looking for you . " they posted it on facebook , where it 's been shared nearly 45,000 times . " you were born june 10 , 1963 in the wee am hours , at marion county general hospital , in indianapolis , indiana . you were placed for adoption through catholic social services , " reads the post . " it has been mom 's decades-long wish to find you , and we would love to meet our big brother . " in an update monday , marie henson added , " i think we found him ! ! he saw the article , and dna tests are our next step ! " no further updates have been posted yet , but should kramer—who also has eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren—find her long-lost biological son , she says she 'll tell him " that i ’ ve loved him for years and years and years . " ( when these two long-lost siblings met , they realized they 'd known each other for years . )
