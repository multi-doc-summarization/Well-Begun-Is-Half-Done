the pwc accountant whose backstage tweet may have distracted him enough to cause the biggest flub in oscars history was specifically asked not to tweet during the awards show , a source tells people . " brian [ cullinan ] was asked not to tweet or use social media during the show . he was fine to tweet before he arrived at the red carpet , but once he was under the auspices of the oscar night job , that was to be his only focus , " the source says . " tweeting right before the best picture category was announced was not something that should have happened . " the tweet in question , along with others from backstage , have since been deleted . pwc said in a statement monday night that " once the error occurred , protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by mr. cullinan or his partner , " per us . meanwhile , the academy continues to investigate the incident and its relationship with pwc ; the telegraph reports the accounting firm is in " crisis meetings " with the academy in an attempt to salvage the 83-year-long relationship between the two . sources tell deadline one possible change being discussed is adding two more pwc auditors backstage , one on each side of the stage , so that the extra auditor could act as a fail-safe in case the first auditor hands a presenter the wrong envelope again . as for whether the academy might sever its relationship with pwc entirely , a source tells people the issue is " very complicated " because " vote-tallying and the oscar night job is just one part of what pwc does with the academy . " page six points out that , in an interview earlier this month , cullinan had noted , " it doesn â€™ t sound very complicated , but you have to make sure you give the presenter the right envelope .
