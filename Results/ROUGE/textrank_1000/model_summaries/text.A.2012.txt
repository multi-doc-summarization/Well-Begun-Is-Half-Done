there 's no olympics this winter , but the us still managed to claim two bronze medals in figure skating yesterday—from the 1964 innsbruck olympics . siblings vivian and ronald joseph came in fourth place in pairs figure skating but were given bronze medals a couple of years later after the west german pair who won silver were disqualified for signing a professional contract before the games , violating then-strict rules about amateurism , the chicago tribune reports . the canadian pair who had won bronze were awarded silver—but the german pair were reawarded their silvers by the international olympic committee in 1987 , and it later emerged that the americans had never made it into the official record books as medalists . us figure skating—along with us and canadian olympic associations—urged the ioc to clear up the confusion after it was highlighted by a new york times story last year , and the records were finally changed yesterday to show that the josephs were bronze medalists and the canadians and germans both won the silver ; a soviet pair won gold . " i am ecstatic , " says vivian joseph , who 's now 66 . " i am sorry it was n't done sooner , but i am happy it is finally done . " she says that after somebody she met at a party years ago looked at the records and disputed her claim to be an olympic medalist , she stopped talking about the medal in case she was accused of lying . " it 's very strange , is n't it , " says her 70-year-old brother , now an orthopedic surgeon . " this is typical of the politics of sport . "
