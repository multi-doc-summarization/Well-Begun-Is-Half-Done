ken mehlman sent pundits chattering when he came out of the closet to support gay marriage yesterday . here 's what they 're saying : “ honestly , i thought the guy came out years ago , ” writes hot air blogger “ allahpundit , ” recalling bill maher ’ s outing of him on larry king in 2006 ( see video ) . still , “ this is a bracing reminder that an openly gay rnc chief probably would still be a problem. ” william saletan of slate thinks it ’ s great that republican bigwigs have an extra gay friend . “ homosexuality is becoming normalized , ” he writes . “ in fact , it 's becoming republicanized. ” mehlman ’ s pitch for gay marriage is downright socially conservative , arguing that it is an institution that promotes and solidifies monogamous commitment . “ my sense is that it ’ ll be a lot less of a big deal to conservatives than it might be to liberals …for whom the political is also the personal , ” writes peter wehner in commentary , adding that he knows and likes mehlman . “ i hope some measure of grace and understanding are accorded to him. ” but evan hurst of wonkette is n't ready to forgive mehlman for his anti-gay campaign tactics , especially because he ’ s still giving money to anti-gay candidates . “ he should probably be punched on live television by ellen degeneres and portia de rossi . ”
