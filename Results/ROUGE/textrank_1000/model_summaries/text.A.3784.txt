elon musk was n't blowing smoke . the bbc reports on a three-sentence statement issued by six of tesla 's nine board members saying the board had " met several times over the last week " to discuss musk 's proposal to take the company private , which he announced via an unexpected tweet tuesday . the talks " included discussion as to how being private could better serve tesla 's long-term interests " and the statement ends by saying the board " is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this . " the three board members who did not sign the statement are musk , brother kimbal musk , and a board member who is on leave , reports the wall street journal . at marketwatch , steve goldstein flags some unresolved points : the statement did n't elaborate on musk 's claim of " funding secured " and raised but did n't answer a question of timing . " 'last week ' predates tesla 's filing on monday of its 10-q with the securities and exchange commission , which did n't mention such discussions . news of a takeover would certainly be considered material , " he writes . shares of tesla are currently down about 1 % .
