an american right-wing extremist is cited some 64 times in the crazed manifesto written by norwegian mass killer anders behring breivik in a bid to justify his terror attack . robert spencer , co-founder of the jihad watch and stop islamization of america ( recently hacked ) blogs denied any responsibility for the attack , calling his writings a " defense of human rights . " if " somebody gets from that that they should kill , well then he 's nuts , " he told nbc news . but some observers believe heated hate speech can trigger such actions . “ when you push the demonization of populations , you often end up with violence , ” warned the research director for the southern poverty law center . the manifesto also frequently cites the blog atlas shrugs by muslim-basher pamela gellar , who insisted that if anyone incited breivik to violence " it was islamic supremacists . " one expert called the norwegian tragedy a " wake up call " for us security . a 2009 department of homeland security report warned of a growing threat from home-grown right-wing extremists and hate groups . “ we could have a similar attack here , and that ’ s my greatest fear , ” said former federal terror analyst daryl johnson . it would n't be fair to blame the american bloggers who influenced breivik , a former cia analyst tells the new york times . still , he adds : " this rhetoric is not cost-free .
