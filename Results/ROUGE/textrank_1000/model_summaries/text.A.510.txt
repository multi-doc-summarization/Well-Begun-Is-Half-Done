the nonprofit that cares for the hollywood sign says it will be " deploying additional technology to tighten up surveillance " after the sign was altered to read " hollyweed " on sunday . the black and white tarps that transformed the sign had been removed by mid-morning on new year 's day with no damage to the letters , prompting police to abandon a search for a suspect . but the hollywood sign trust says it will adopt new measures to " deter unwanted visitors in the future , " reports the hollywood reporter . these could include updates to the existing security camera system , which recorded a " lone individual " dressed in black hanging tarps from the letters around 3am sunday , reports the los angeles times . such an incident " shows us where there are opportunities to make improvements , " says the trust 's chairman , adding the group will work with police to discover the weak link in its security . " our concern is the safety of the neighborhood and the trespassers that put themselves at risk because it is extremely unsafe to be on the sign , " which a student also altered to read " hollyweed " in 1976 as part of an art project . the existing security system includes 35 cameras that watch the sign and hillside . the area is also protected by a wrought-iron fence and a police officer in a guard house , which is manned at all hours . the times notes rain and clouds may have provided concealment for sunday 's trespasser .
