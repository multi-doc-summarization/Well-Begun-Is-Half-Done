edward snowden spent the night in moscow 's airport and was expected to fly to cuba todayâ€”but american authorities are making it clear that they 'd prefer that the nsa whistleblower was enjoying their hospitality instead . in a statement , the national security council said it expects moscow to look at " all options available to expel mr. snowden back to the us to face justice " especially in light of " intensified cooperation after the boston marathon bombings and our history of working with russia on law enforcement matters , " cbs reports . but " intensified cooperation " may not be coming : the washington post reports that a russian official today told interfax that moscow does n't have the legal authority to comply with the us government 's request . other officials add that air travelers who do n't cross passport control are n't technically on russian land ; because snowden is without a russian visa , there 's no way he could have gone through passport control . john kerry is chiming in , adds the ap , calling it " deeply troubling " if russia allows snowden to flee . but is snowden actually cuba-bound ? the airline aeroflot told the ap he was booked on a moscow-havana flight this morning ( the expectation being he 'd then travel to venezuela and then to ecuador , where wikileaks says he will seek asylum ) , prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight . but snowden apparently never boarded , reports business insider via an article with this headline : " russia just punked a bunch of journalists who are now on their way to havana . " ap moscow correspondent max seddon confirmed that there was no sign of snowden , tweeting , " cuba here we come . taxiing down sheremetevo runway and no sign of snowden . seats empty still by 17a . " how did snowden get out of hong kong yesterday to begin with ? despite the chinese territory 's autonomy , the final decision came from beijing , sources tell the new york times . the move lets china save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle . some legal experts are telling the new york times the us government goofed in waiting until saturday to revoke snowden 's passport , though charges were filed june 14 . says a former federal prosecutor , " they missed an opportunity to freeze him in place . " still , the times notes that snowden may have still been able to fly to moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from ecuador that wikileaks helped snowden obtain .
