name your favorite culprit for the mass extinction that wiped out nearly every life form on earth 250 million years ago . a spectacular asteroid , perhaps ? massive volcanic eruptions ? both are popular theories , but a new study encourages sleuths of the permian era to think much , much smaller , reports the guardian . as in microscopically smaller . mit scientists propose that a microbe called methanosarcina proliferated in the oceans , disgorging huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere and making life in the water and on land all but impossible for most species . " in short , a microbial innovation may have tipped over the balance to cause the great dying , " explains ars technica . so what caused the microbes to explode in numbers ? that 's where those volcanoes may have played a role , though a lesser one than has been long surmised . scientists think a flurry of eruptions in siberia resulted in a huge increase in nickel , upon which methanosarcina happens to thrive . an estimated 90 % of marine species were wiped out in the changed atmosphere , along with 70 % of land vertebrates . it took millions of years for both to recover , with the first dinosaurs showing up about 20 million years later , reports reuters . ( scientists recently determined that the permian mass extinction happened really , really quickly . )
