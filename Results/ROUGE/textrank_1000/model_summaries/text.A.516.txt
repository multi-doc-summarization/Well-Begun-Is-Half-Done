lightning strikes people often enough , but usually not when they 're opening the fridge for a snack . such is the plight of texas high school student macie martinez , who was home with her parents on memorial day when a storm blew in . she was opening the fridge to grab some applesauce when the bolt struck . " it was so surreal , " her mom tells the houston chronicle . " there was a loud explosion , everything went dark and at the same time , macie started screaming , but it was n't from her throat . it was a deep scream . " the teen tells myfox austin that she remembers not being able to feel her legs , and her parents hustled her to the hospital . she suffered nerve damage in her arms and hands , and doctors are keeping an eye on her kidney and liver , but she seems to have escaped major harm . " i feel very lucky , " she tells the tv station . " lucky to be sitting here doing this interview today . " she 's even making light of herself on instagram , telling people to call her sparky . it turns out that martinez 's father also got zapped , though his telltale rash did n't show up until after the family had returned from the hospital . " my right arm gets tingly , " he says . the family home sustained significant damage from the strike , which a neighbor says appeared to have come from beneath the house and exited through the roof . appliances were fried , with the coffee maker one of the few survivors . that 's fine with mom : " i get my daughter and coffee maker , so i 'm set . " ( this guy survived a lightning strike to the head . )
