renowned german art dealer alfred flechtheim had been named part of the " jewish world conspiracy " in the nazi press even before 1933 , so when adolf hitler came to power , he chose to flee , and died 4 years later in london , reports courthouse news . his art collection remained in berlin and at least eight paintings are now part of the bavarian state paintings collection , reports the art newspaper . they should instead be with flechtheim 's heirs in the us and england , per a lawsuit filed against the state of bavaria in us district court in manhattan on monday . the widow of flechtheim 's sole heir ( his nephew ) and the nephew 's son cite " a presumption of international law " that sales of jewish property after jan. 30 , 1933 , are n't legitimate because they were made under duress . and so in the case of the six paintings by max beckmann and two others by juan gris and paul klee , timing is the issue . the bavarian state paintings collection argues the paintings , worth up to $ 20 million , were sold by flechtheim in 1932 . penny hulton of england and stepson michael hulton of san francisco—who 've been locked in a years-long battle with bavaria over what deutsche welle calls " one of the world 's most disputed estates " —say the paintings were sold after he left the country in may 1933 . they " would have remained accessible to flechtheim but for the climate at the time , " their lawyer tells reuters . " the state-level program of aryanizing jewish businesses made the confiscation possible . " ( these jewish heirs want back their gold and jewels . )
