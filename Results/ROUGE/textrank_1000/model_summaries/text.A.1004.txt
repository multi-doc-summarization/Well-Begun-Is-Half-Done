the us military is trying to reclaim signing bonuses and student loan compensation it says it improperly awarded to 9,700 california soldiers during the mid- to late 2000s , at the height of the iraq and afghanistan wars . the la times reports that soldiers who served their six-year contracts to completion are now being placed in debt collection for failing to return their bonuses , which in many cases were as high as $ 25,000 . the soldiers , understandably , are less than thrilled that a government they put their lives on the line for is now trying to walk back on its promises . " i signed a contract that i literally risked my life to fulfill , " says former army sergeant first class robert richmond , one of the soldiers from whom the government is trying to reclaim money . " they ’ ll get their money , but i want those years back , " says former army master sergeant susan haley . the issue , npr reports , stems from a 2010 discovery that california 's national guard office had misspent up to $ 100 million . independent audits revealed the money had gone to signing bonuses for soldiers who should n't have been eligible for such compensation . ( it was meant to be limited to " soldiers in high-demand assignments ... [ or ] noncommissioned officers badly needed in units due to deploy , " per the times . ) a years-long review of the program revealed almost 10,000 incidences of improperly awarded bonuses—bonuses the military say it 's legally required to recoup . no one , from soldiers to military leadership to lawmakers , is happy about the situation . the military says it would happily defer the debts if congress would legalize it . as the story gains more media traction , the california house of representatives on sunday condemned the pentagon 's effort to recoup the money , and pledged to do what it could to help the veterans .
