drivers in a london suburb were n't exactly sympathetic yesterday to a suicidal woman who blocked traffic for two hours as emergency crews tried talking her down , the independent reports . amid the m3-motorway delay in sunbury , surrey , angry tweets came rolling out : " tell her to get on with it , " wrote one twitter user to the police force 's account . " bloody ruining everyone ’ s weekend . sat in this for an hour and a half now . " " to the person causing traffic jam on the m3/ a31 , you selfish , selfish tw*t. " " surrey police , can ’ t you rubber bullet the jumper on m3/ a316 and get the traffic moving ? or get net ready and charge her ? ridiculous . " police responded on twitter by explaining the cause for delay and responding to criticism about the closure , the guardian reports . " if we could think of better we ’ d honestly take it , " wrote the chief constable of police in surrey to one complaint . " we know how irritating road closures are ! " but not everyone on the force played nice : " having members of the public taunt somebody who is clearly in a distressed state as we did earlier today is completely unacceptable , " said an inspector . eventually first responders saved the woman , who is being under the mental health act , and one angry tweeter dialed it down in response to twitter backlash : " goodness i am so sorry for any offence . ... i apologise unreservedly . "
