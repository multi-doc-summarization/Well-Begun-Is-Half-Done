smoke was detected in multiple places on egyptair flight 804 moments before it plummeted into the mediterranean , but the cause of the crash that killed all 66 on board remains unclear , the french air accident investigation agency says . agency spokesman sebastien barthe tells the ap that the plane 's automatic detection system sent messages indicating smoke a few minutes before the plane disappeared from radar while flying over the eastern mediterranean early on thursday morning . the messages , he says , " generally mean the start of a fire , " but he adds : " we are drawing no conclusions from this . everything else is pure conjecture . " the aircraft had been cruising normally in clear skies early thursday when it suddenly lurched left , then right , spun all the way around , and plummeted 38,000 feet into the sea . aviation experts have said the erratic flight suggests a bomb blast or a struggle in the cockpit . but so far no hard evidence has emerged . search crews found floating debris and human remains on friday , and photos posted on the facebook page of egypt 's chief military spokesman appear to show the remains of plane seats , life jackets , and a scrap of cloth that looks to be part of a baby 's blanket . search crews from egypt and five other countries—greece , britain , france , the us , and cyprus—are searching a wide area of the eastern med for further wreckage .
