tunisia was not pleased today when a battle between libya ’ s warring factions spilled across the border today , after moammar gadhafi ’ s forces attacked a rebel-held frontier crossing . the incursion was brief and limited , and gadhafi ’ s forces even apologized locally , reuters reports . but tunisia ’ s foreign ministry still issued a statement expressing “ extreme indignation ” and demanding “ measures to put an immediate stop to these violations. ” but tunisia has proven remarkably welcoming to libyans who aren ’ t fighting . some 30,000 refugees have fled there , and the vast majority of them have been welcomed into the homes of tunisians , the new york times reports . only about 2,500 have had to settle in the relatively small refugee camp at the border . “ it ’ s the first time i ’ ve seen such an impressive response , ” says a spokesman for the un ’ s high commissioner for refugees .
