his name is pizza and he lives in a chinese mall where visitors pose for selfies next to his glass enclosure and knock loudly to get his attention . such is life when you 're the " world 's saddest polar bear , " per the daily express . pizza , a polar bear hybrid , is one of 500 animals living at grandview aquarium inside a guangzhou shopping center , where critics say animals are housed in dimly lit rooms with few if any natural surroundings . peta calls it " the saddest zoo in the world , " asserting that animals " suffer from neglect , poor care , lack of stimulation , and lack of natural light . " foxes and wolves have been spotted pacing in their enclosures and scratching at walls , the group says . animals asia first drew international attention to the zoo earlier this year when it started a petition calling for the facility to be closed , reports mashable and the huffington post . more than 270,000 people have added their signatures , leading zoo officials to adopt some of the group 's recommendations , including putting snow in the polar bear enclosures , per a release . but more " significant changes " are needed , says animals asia 's animal welfare director , dave neale . " keeping animals in this way is not acceptable . " neale , who recently toured the facility and says animals asia has been asked to advise it , notes , " it is difficult for me to work with people that have chosen to house animals such as this bear in such poor conditions . " but " if our experience has taught us anythingâ€”first you open doors , then you open cages . " ( a much-maligned zoo in buenos aires is shutting its doors . )
