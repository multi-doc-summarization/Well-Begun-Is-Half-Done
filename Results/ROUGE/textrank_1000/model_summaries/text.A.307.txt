admissions goofs are nothing new . learning you 've lost your admission in july is another matter . that 's the situation with the university of california irvine , which withdrew 499 offers of admission two months before the fall term is to begin . by the los angeles times ' count , that 's abnormally high : other uc campuses gave " recession " numbers ranging from seven to 150 . per the school , 290 of the reversals were because of transcript issues ; the rest were over low senior-year grades . many of the newly disappointed are accusing the school of fishing for slight or even unsubstantiated reasons to dump would-be freshmen after too many made the choice to enroll . the lat cites numbers that suggest they may not be off base : the uc office of the president says 7,100 students made the decision to enroll , versus a planned freshman class of 6,250 . a rep for the school concurs that the admissions office has been cracking down on verifying requirements " as a result of more students [ having ] accepted admissions to uci than it expected . " in case after case , the crackdown smells off : one student was told only one of the two required copies of her transcript was mailed ; she says they were sent in the same envelope . another student says he was told his transcript did n't contain a graduation date ; he says it did . they 're appealing , and they 're not the only ones : some 409—or 82 % —have , with many of the students quoted by the lat and oc register as having 4.0-plus gpas ... and having already turned down other schools and scholarships . as of friday , 63 have emerged victorious . the school says the appeals process , which normally takes up to six weeks , has been accelerated .
