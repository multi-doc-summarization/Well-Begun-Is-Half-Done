a doctor who appears to have been the target of a former physician who started shooting at a hospital , killing one person and injuring six , says he has no idea why he would have been singled out . dr. kamran ahmed tells the new york post he was n't the only one dr. henry bello had a problem with . however , " he never argued with me , " ahmed says . " i do n't know why he put my name . " a law enforcement official tells the ap that bello arrived at bronx-lebanon hospital center in the bronx on friday with an assault rifle , which was bought in upstate new york about a week earlier , hidden under his lab coat and asked for a doctor he blamed for his having to resign ( presumably ahmed ) , but the doctor was n't there at the time . authorities say bello went to the 16th and 17th floors and started shooting anyway , killing dr. tracy sin-yee tam , who , like him , was a family medicine doctor . hospital officials say that tam normally worked in one of the hospital 's satellite clinics and was covering a shift in the main hospital as a favor to someone else . before the shooting , bello sent an email to the daily news , blaming colleagues he said forced him to resign two years earlier . " this hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine , " the email said . bello 's former co-workers described a man who was aggressive , loud , and threatening . bello had warned his former colleagues when he was forced out in 2015 that he would return someday to kill them . ahmed says bello " had a problem with almost everybody " and " that 's why they fired him , because so many people complained . " bello died from a self-inflicted gunshot . the six injured people were hospitalized .
