oh , the difficulties faced by rand paul : he 's considering running for president in 2016 but would like to run for re-election to the us senate at the same time , just in case , and he 's not sure kentucky law currently allows him to do so . so he 's asked the state senate majority leader to pass a law ensuring he can conduct both campaigns simultaneously , the washington times reports . current state law says a candidate 's name can not appear on a ballot more than once , the wire explains . " yes , i am working on clarifying an ambiguous state law that rand paul believes is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to bar running for re-election to the senate and for president at the same time , " the majority leader , damon thayer , confirms . " the purpose of the bill will be to make clear that rand paul or anyone in a similar situation in kentucky can run for both offices in the same year . " but the kentucky state house speaker , greg stumbo , is a democrat , and an anonymous republican party operative tells the times that stumbo has said he would n't allow such a bill through the democrat-controlled house . ( how serious is paul about a presidential run ? thayer tells wfpl that paul " is strongly considering seeking the republican nomination for president . " )
