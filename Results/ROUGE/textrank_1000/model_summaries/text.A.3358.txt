if there 's one thing everyone who 's ever had a hangover can probably admit to , it 's that they 'll try just about anything to minimize the anguish . now , thanks to the " iv doctor , " a service started in december by new york urologist dr. elliot nadelson and his surgical resident son adam , one 's degree of suffering may be at least marginally reduced—for a price . ailing partiers in nyc and the hamptons ( and , soon , chicago ) with the right kind of pocket change can for $ 249 have a nurse come to their homes or offices and administer 200ml of fluid by iv , plus a cocktail of drugs to combat nausea ( zofran ) , heartburn ( pepcid ) , and headache/inflammation ( toradol ) . that particular package , called " revive , " is the most popular , and recommended for those on their " deathbed . " " look , it 's not a miracle cure ... but if you go in feeling like a 2 , you come out a half-hour later feeling like a 7 , that 's a game changer , " one repeat customer tells cnn money . a reporter who tried the service for thrillist—his prep included four martinis and an " indeterminate portion " of a whisky bottle—notes the advantages of the iv : a higher absorption rate , less peeing , and a quicker impact . he says he ended up " achieving a state of heightened alrightness ... a victory . " nadelson says his team has treated european princesses and olympic track stars , but that his biggest client base works in finance , " burning the candle at both ends . " this service is n't the first of its kind . hangover heaven opened two years ago in las vegas with a 24-hour clinic and nurses who will make hotel-room visits , and miami and atlanta are home to reviv and hydration station , respectively . ( hungover ? do n't blame it on this mixture . )
