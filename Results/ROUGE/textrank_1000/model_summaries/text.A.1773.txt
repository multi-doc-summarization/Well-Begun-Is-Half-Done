the name of apple ’ s new tablet is already inspiring jokes , eye-rolling , and fretting among the business class , reminding many of a certain , umm , feminine product . business insider immediately declared the name “ terrible , ” and the internet soon filled with snark . “ how will it stand up to other tablets if i pour a test tube full of blue water on it ? ” asked one blogger . “ are there no women in the marketing or biz dev department of mac ? ” wondered one user , and indeed , no women were present at the tablet ’ s unveiling , the washington post notes . madtv even coined the term ipad in a 2007 parody about—you guessed it—an apple brand maxi pad ( see story ) . then again , people bought something called the “ wii ” in droves , so maybe all bets are off .
