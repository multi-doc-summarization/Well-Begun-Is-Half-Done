the inspector general 's irs report is out ( read it in full at the washington post , if 54 pages of dry analysis and liberal use of the underline function sound like your thing ) , and some pundits say it 's not exactly as jaw-droppingly scandalous as it was made out to be . the delays for organizations seeking tax-exempt status caused by the irs heaping extra scrutiny on them is certainly unacceptable , writes ezra klein at the washington post , but there 's " no allegation here of politicization , " he writes . just confusion and incompetence . " the most hotly anticipated irs probe since watergate did n't exactly live up to the hype , " write kelsey snell and lauren french at politico , offering some takeaways from the report : first , they agree irs agents were n't motivated by partisanship , but asking organizations for donor records was burdensome and unnecessary . and the irs has more work to do to fix the problems : the report makes nine recommendations , but the agency has agreed to only seven . one it has n't agreed to is drafting new guidelines for how it should investigate politically-oriented groups . but given how touchy the subject is right now , it may not be able to for some time , say snell and frenchâ€”and that means it may now be impossible to actually police which groups really are crossing the line .
