howard stern goes back a ways with president trump , who has been a regular guest on his show for decades . on thursday , stern generated headlines for voicing a concern about the man he considers a friend : becoming president " is something that is gon na be detrimental to his mental health , too , because , he wants to be liked , he wants to be loved , " stern said , per entertainment weekly . " all of this hatred and stuff directed towards him . it 's not good for him . it 's not good . " also of note : stern says he thinks trump ran only as a contract ploy . " i think it started out as like a kinda cool , fun thing to do in order to get a couple more bucks out of nbc for the apprentice , i actually do believe that , " stern said , per cnn . he added that trump always liked hillary clinton and thinks the " new donald trump " merely latched onto a conservative base because it was the most effective route to victory . “ i don ’ t believe that , for example now , that he ’ s had some sort of rethink on abortion and all this . " no response , at least yet , from trump himself .
