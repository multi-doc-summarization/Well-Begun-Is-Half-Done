justin bieber and usher might be on the hook for $ 10 million after being accused of ripping off a song . an appeals court in virginia today ordered the pair to stand trial over " somebody to love . " an r & b singer named de rico claims that he and his songwriting partner played their version for usher , and then usher took it to bieber , and the pair stole it , reports reuters and tmz . a lower court dismissed the case , but the 4th us circuit court of appeals today put it back in motion . " after listening to the ( de rico ) song and the bieber and usher songs as wholes , we conclude that their choruses are similar enough and also significant enough that a reasonable jury could find the songs intrinsically similar , " wrote judge pamela harris . she added that the lyric " somebody to love " has an " almost identical rhythm and a strikingly similar melody .
