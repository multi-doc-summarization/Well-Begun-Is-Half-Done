the nsa is poring over pretty much all emails and texts sent across the border by americans to look for information that might raise red flags , the new york times reports . the revelation means that the nsa 's surveillance of americans is broader than was previously known : it 's not just direct communication between an american and foreign targets that will be intercepted ; it 's any email or text about a such a target . as new york puts it , " if you mention a terrorist 's email address or phone number to a friend overseas , the nsa intends to find out . " the nsa temporarily copies most cross-border communications , the times notes , and scans them . the expanded surveillance was mentioned , but largely overlooked , in information released by edward snowden in june . the aclu calls it " dragnet surveillance " that will cause ordinary people to hesitate before discussing sensitive topics or visiting controversial websites for fear they will be monitored . “ individually , these hesitations might appear to be inconsequential , but the accumulation of them over time will change citizens ’ relationship to one another and to the government. ” a former nsa general counsel cites an example of how it could be useful : say intel officials knew al-qaeda was using a particular phone number for a specific plot . “ if someone is sending that number out , chances are they are on the inside of the plot , and i want to find the people who are on the inside of the plot .
