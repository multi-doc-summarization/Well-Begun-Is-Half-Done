sad news for cancer patients : a new study finds that those who receive chemotherapy during the end stages of the disease are at a higher risk of enduring a less peaceful death . of 386 terminally ill patients in a new study , 65 % of those who received chemotherapy during the final few months of their life died in their preferred place ( for example , at home as opposed to in a hospital ) . but 80 % of those who had chosen to stop treatment died in their preferred location , cbs news reports . those who continued chemotherapy were more likely to die in an intensive care unit , to undergo cpr , and to be placed on a ventilator . those who continued treatment were also less likely to have discussed their end-of-life wishes with their doctors . " there ’ s a subtle dance that happens between oncologist and patient , " the lead author explains to the boston globe . " doctors don ’ t want to broach the subject of dying , especially in younger patients , because it makes those patients think we ’ re giving up on them . " of the subjects , who died within an average of four months after the study , 56 % continued chemotherapy—and they tended to be younger , wealthier , more educated , and more optimistic about their chances of survival . the lead author thinks chemotherapy may give end-stage patients a false sense of hope .
