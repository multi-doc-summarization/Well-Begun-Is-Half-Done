the fda made history thursday when , for the first time ever , it approved a genetically altered animal for human consumption , the washington post reports . after two decades of what the fda calls " exhaustive and rigorous scientific review " the aquadvantage salmon will be hitting supermarket seafood cases . according to abc news , the aquadvantage is an atlantic salmon with a chinook salmon growth hormone that allows it to grow all year and a gene from the eel-like ocean pout to activate that growth hormone . basically this means the aquadvantage will be big enough to eat in a year and a half instead of the three years required for a normal atlantic salmon . the aquadvantage is a " game changer " â€”nutritious food that 's environmentally responsible , says ron stotish , ceo of aquabounty , which makes the genetically altered salmon . the post reports the approval of the aquadvantage was opposed by everyone from food-safety activists to the salmon fishing industry . " i think it is a grave mistake we will come to regret , " says one environmental group representative . opponents call the aquadvantage a " frankenfish " ( though technically it would be a " frankenfish 's monster , " but that 's neither here nor there ) and worry it could get loose and destroy the wild atlantic salmon population . aquabounty assures opponents that all its salmon are bred female and sterile , making their survival in the wild impossible ( which sounds ominously familiar ) . according to abc , laws do n't require stores to label the aquadvantage , and it 's likely consumers wo n't even know they 're eating it . whole foods , trader joe 's , target , and others have already vowed not to sell the genetically altered salmon , the post reports .
