us missile launchers and other equipment needed to set up a controversial missile defense system have arrived in south korea , the us and south korean militaries said tuesday , a day after north korea test-launched four ballistic missiles into the ocean near japan . the plans to deploy the terminal high-altitude area defense system , or thaad , within this year have angered not only north korea , but also china and russia , which see the system 's powerful radars as a security threat , the ap reports . china firmly opposes the deployment and it responded quickly , saying it will take " necessary measures " to protect itself and warning that the us and south korea should be prepared to bear the consequences . washington and seoul say the system is defensive and not meant to be a threat to beijing or moscow . the us military said in a statement that thaad can intercept and destroy short and medium range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights . " continued provocative actions by north korea , to include yesterday 's launch of multiple missiles , only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy thaad to south korea , " adm. harry harris , head of the us pacific command , said in the statement . the bbc reports that there is also opposition within south korea , with those living near missile sites fearing that the system itself could become a target .
