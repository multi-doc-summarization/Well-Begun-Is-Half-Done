the latest us geological survey forecast for california does n't contain much that will reassure people worried about earthquakesâ€”unless they find fatalism reassuring . the report says there is not only a 99 % chance of a 6.7 magnitude or greater quake like the 1994 northridge one hitting the state in the next 30 years , the chances of a mega-quake of 8 magnitude or greater are significantly higher than earlier thought , the ap reports . " california is earthquake country , and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one , " says lead author ned field , a usgs geophysicist . he says that out of the state 's hundreds of faults , the " locked and loaded " san andreas fault is still the biggest threat . field says the odds of a mega-quake in the next three decades have risen to 7 % from 4.7 % since the 2008 forecast because scientists now have a better understanding of the fault system and how quakes can jump from fault to fault , the los angeles times reports . in california , " it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few [ well-separated ] faults , but with a vast interconnected fault system , " he says . the usgs still ca n't predict exactly when an earthquake will hit , but it 's testing an early warning system that will give authorities vital seconds to do things like shut off gas lines and slow down trains , the ap reports . ( another federal study warns that small , fracking-linked quakes in oklahoma and kansas are making a big one more likely . )
