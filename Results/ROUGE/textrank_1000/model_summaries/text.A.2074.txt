several top executives of a french telecom are slated to stand trial for employees who killed themselves in what prosecutors have called a culture of " moral harassment , " the bbc reports . france telecom 's former ceo , didier lombard , and six managers are facing $ 35,000 fines and two years in prison if found culpable of workplace bullying . the alleged harassment occurred after france telecom was privatized and executives tried restructuring the company in 2006 , partly by slashing 22,000 jobs and retraining thousands of others . " i 'll get them out one way or another , through the window or through the door , " lombard told top managers in 2007 . the apparent fallout was brutal , with at least 19 workers killing themselves ( union reps say it was 35 ) and one taking his life during a staff meeting , sky news reports . one employee fatally set himself on fire in an office parking lot in 2011 , the bbc reported at the time , and a female worker attempted suicide after hearing she would be transferred for the third time . but french telecom , now called orange , plans to dispute the charges . " i forcefully reject that plans that were essential to the survival of the company could have been the cause of the human tragedies cited by the complainants , " lombard wrote when the harassment probe began in 2012 , reports the financial times .
