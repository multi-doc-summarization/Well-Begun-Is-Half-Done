jurgen klinsmann is out as coach of the us men 's soccer team , the ap reports , ending a contentious five-year love-hate relationship on the job . us soccer federation president sunil gulati announced monday that klinsmann has been " relieved of his duties " as coach and technical director for us soccer . the move is n't exactly surprising , notes the new york times , following a pair of embarrassing losses that damaged the americans ' efforts to qualify for the 2018 world cup . the final straw came less than a week ago , as the times puts it : " then came the 4-0 thrashing against the ticos in which klinsmann ’ s team looked alternately disorganized , dispirited and—perhaps most damningly—disinterested . " " while we remain confident that we have quality players to help us advance to russia 2018 , the form and growth of the team up to this point left us convinced that we need to go in a different direction , " said gulati in a statement . klinsmann replaced bob bradley in july 2011 and led the team to the 2013 concacaf gold cup title and the second round of the 2014 world cup , where the americans lost to belgium in extra time . but the us was knocked out in last year 's gold cup semifinals , lost to mexico in a playoff for a confederations cup berth and started 0-2 this month in the final round of world cup qualifying .
