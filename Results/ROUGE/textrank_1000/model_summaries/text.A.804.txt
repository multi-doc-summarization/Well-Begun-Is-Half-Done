former model christina estrada made history friday when she received a stunning $ 97 million divorce settlement from a british court , the telegraph reports . and even that was less than half what she was asking . the settlement includes cash and assets from her ex , saudi businessman walid juffali , and is the largest in english history . “ this is what i am accustomed to , " the guardian quotes estrada as telling the judge . " it is difficult to convey the extraordinary level of luxury and opulence we were fortunate enough to enjoy. ” estrada 's initial request included annual payments of $ 152,000 for handbags , $ 780,000 for renting private jets , $ 107,000 for cocktail dresses , and more . the court says the final settlement meets estrada 's " reasonable needs . " estrada , a us citizen , says she knows how all this is " perceived in the wider world . " “ having grown up in a middle-class family … i am fully aware that the spectacular life walid and i led was immensely fortunate and rarefied , " the guardian quotes the former model as saying in a statement . in 2012 , juffali secretly married a 25-year-old model with whom he started a family ( islamic law allows muslim men to have multiple spouses ) . two years later , he divorced estrada , again without her knowledge . estrada 's lawyers had argued juffali is worth $ 10 billion , but the 61-year-old businessman , who is currently being treated for terminal cancer , claims it 's more like $ 147 million , the new york daily news reports . ( a us divorce settlement dwarfs the amount involved here . )
