honolulu police have apparently relented : they have agreed to give up the legal exemption that allows them to have sex with prostitutes . state sen. clayton hee tells the ap that he and police came to a compromise in a meeting yesterday : " sexual penetration " will be a no-no , but police working undercover will still be able to solicit sex with prostitutes , in order to make arrests . a honolulu police rep says officers have never had their department 's blessing to have sex with prostitutes , and that this whole to-do started because the department was just trying to remove a vague clause from an anti-prostitution bill . " i suppose that in retrospect the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation , " hee said . hee tells khon2 that " there are other parts of the exemption that will remain and that includes sexual contact , " but that " hpd agrees that the sexual penetration language in the law that they are exempt from should no longer be an exemption for police officers . " as to khon2 's assertion that " some people might think sexual contact might include touching some areas of the body that shouldn ’ t be touched . what would you say to that ? ” hee apparently had no reply , with a police official just saying " we have strict policy " that he could n't go into . and the woman who drafted the initial language change to the exemption expressed surprise : " in all of the versions of the language , never did it exclude their ability to solicit verbally , " she notes .
