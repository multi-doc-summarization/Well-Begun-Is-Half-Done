a 5-month-old born using a " revolutionary " genetic technique is said to be the world 's first baby created using dna from three parents since the technique was banned about two decades ago , new scientist reports . the boy , ided by the international business times as abrahim hassan , was born in mexico to jordanian parents , and embryologists are hoping his successful birth will hasten using the procedure elsewhere . abrahim 's mother , shaban , carries the gene for leigh syndromeâ€”a severe neurological condition that decimates mental and physical capabilities and often results in a child 's death before kindergarten . although hassan herself is healthy , her first two children died from the disease . that 's when she and her husband looked for assistance from nyc 's new hope fertility center , where a team led by dr. john zhang started them off on an alternative way to parenthood . there are a couple of different ways to pull off the three-parent technique , but the one they chose to go with is called spindle nuclear transfer , in which the nucleus from the mother 's egg is placed in a donor egg whose own nucleus has been taken out ; that egg , which then contains nuclear dna from the mom and mitochondrial dna from the donor , is fertilized with the father 's sperm . five embryos were created in this case , and when just one " took , " it was implanted into hassan , who delivered abrahim nine months later . this all had to be done in mexico , where zhang says " there are no rules " ( the times labels it " relatively flexible legislation " ; the procedure is n't approved in the us ) . one concern scientists are keeping an eye on : faulty mitochondria that could replicate , a problem that may have occurred when the technique was last tried in the '90s . ( the uk has oked a controversial gene-editing method . )
