three scientists from the united states , france , and canada have been awarded the nobel prize in physics for advances in laser physics , including the first woman to take home the prize in 55 years . the swedish royal academy of sciences on tuesday awarded half the $ 1.01 million prize to arthur ashkin of the united states , and the other half will be shared by gerard mourou of france and donna strickland of canada , per the ap . strickland is the third female laureate in physics , but the first in more than half a century , reports the bbc . the academy says ashkin developed " optical tweezers " that can grab tiny particles such as viruses without damaging them . as the guardian notes , " this means scientists can hold even living cells in place , allowing them to probe their inner workings . " strickland and mourou helped develop short and intense laser pulses that have broad industrial and medical applications . the nobel panel 's explanation : " ultra-sharp laser beams make it possible to cut or drill holes in various materials extremely preciselyâ€”even in living matter . millions of eye operations are performed every year with the sharpest of laser beams . " ( a cern scientist just got suspended for saying physics was built by men . )
