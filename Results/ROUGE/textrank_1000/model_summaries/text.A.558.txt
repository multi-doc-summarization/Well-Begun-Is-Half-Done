crystal harris and hugh hefner did n't tie the knot yesterday , and they did n't mope , either . hef took to twitter to share his chin-up attitude : " this was going to be my wedding day , but life is full of surprises , " the 85-year-old wrote . " after all is said & done , staying single is probably for the best . " single , however , is not code for " alone . " perez hilton reports that exes karissa and kristina shannon ( yep , twins ) have already moved back into the mansion , which they left a year and a half ago . and tmz reports that hef has been cozying up to miss january 2011 . and how did the runaway bride spend her day ? hanging poolside in las vegas in a teeny bikini and high heels with a group of friends , one of which was heidi montag . but do we detect a hint of sadness in hugh 's voice ? a series of tweets posted in rapid succession this afternoon sound a little down . an example : " the sunday night mansion movie is elle fanning , amanda michalka & kyle chandler in jj abrams ' super 8 . life goes on . "
