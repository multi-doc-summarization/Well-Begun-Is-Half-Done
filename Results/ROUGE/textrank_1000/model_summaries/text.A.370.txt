president trump has been accused of signing off on a legally flawed immigration order crafted without congressional input , but according to politico 's sources , his team did have some help on capitol hill—they just could n't tell their bosses about the order . the sources say aides on the house judicial committee helped the trump team draft the executive order between the election and his swearing-in , but they were required to sign nondisclosure agreements and republican leaders were not informed . in a statement , a committee aide said they had been permitted " to offer their policy expertise , " but trump was responsible for the " final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll-out and implementation . " some senior republican lawmakers saw a draft version of the order early last week , insiders tell buzzfeed , but they were left in the dark about major changes , which meant even legal us residents were blocked from entering the country , until after the order was signed . " it was chaotic and very uncoordinated and it caused not only a lot of concern and problems on capitol hill , it caused obviously a big pr backlash for the administration , " one gop aide says . according to the washington post 's sources , the bungled rollout has exposed not just a rift between the white house and congressional republicans , but between different factions in the white house itself , with many unhappy with steve bannon 's disregard for tradition . " the problem they ’ ve got is this is an off-broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on broadway , " says newt gingrich .
