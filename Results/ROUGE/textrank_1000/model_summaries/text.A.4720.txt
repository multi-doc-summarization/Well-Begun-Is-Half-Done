those worried the donald trump-megyn kelly conflagration had burned out should don protective gear once more : kelly is back from a 10-day vacation , and the real estate mogul is back to his online berating of her , usa today reports . on the heels of his remarks that kelly was bleeding out of her eyes and other orifices , as well as his issues with how she moderated the debate overall , trump took to twitter last night to elucidate his thoughts on kelly 's first post-vacay show yesterday . what the huffington post calls a " ceasefire " between the two parties , apparently orchestrated by fox honcho roger ailes himself , came to an abrupt end shortly after kelly tweeted a link last night to trump 's immigration policies . trump 's attacks began anew minutes later , after she squared off with dr. cornel west , who spoke on # blacklivesmatter . " . @ megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation , she is really off her game . was afraid to confront dr. cornel west . no clue on immigration ! " trump tweeted , followed shortly thereafter with : " i liked the kelly file much better without @ megynkelly . perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation ! " ( fox , for its part , says kelly 's vacation was planned , per the huffington post . ) trump wrapped up his twitter tirade with a retweet of someone who apparently agrees with trump 's characterization of kelly as a " bimbo " in a previous retweet . this one said , " the bimbo back in town . i hope not for long . " ( trump 's apparently not feeling very apologetic now , but click for a list of all his past mea culpas . )
