first , the words of caution : " there is absolutely no evidence at this point in time that the child is madeleine mccann , " says an australian police commissioner . but the body of a child , found near the south australia town of wynarka and thus far unidentified , has led the detectives investigating the disappearance of madeleine to reach out to their australian counterparts . here 's why : the remains , contained in a suitcase that also held a quilt and some clothing , are thought to be those of a fair-haired girl , between the ages of 2 and 4 , who was killed some time after the beginning of 2007 . madeleine vanished at age 3 on may 3 , 2007 . nbc news reports police said the child was likely white , with hair about 7 inches long . the australian associated press reported the skeletal remains were found on july 15 ; it 's thought the suitcase had been left along the rural highway four to six weeks prior , with the child having been killed before that . british law enforcement officials confirm they have made contact , but neither side sounds overly optimistic . it 's " highly unlikely " the remains are those of madeleine , says detective superintendent des bray , per the guardian . adds the commissioner , to suggest the child is madeleine " at this point in time would purely be speculating to get attention . " what they are zeroing in on , per the advertiser : that homemade quilt . " the quilt is really important to the investigation , " says bray . investigators believe a portion of the quilt fabric , which shows colored musical notes against a black background , was made in new york around 2008 .
