scientists hoped they 'd find some exotic creatures burrowing through some of the deepest caves in croatia , and they did not come up short . meet geophilus hadesi—or " hades , " named for the greek god of the underworld—a subterranean centipede discovered in the velebit mountain range by the croatian biospeleological society , per a press release . the carnivore eats other invertebrates and also shows some longer-than-average legs and antennae ( which help it find prey in total darkness , livescience notes ) , as well as jaws filled with poison . but what really makes this " centipede from hell " unique is that it 's one of " only two remarkably troglomorphic geophilomorphs hitherto known , " per the study in zookeys . translation : it 's one of only two centipede species that never leaves its cave dwellings , earning it its alternate title of " king of the underworld . " and hades has a queen , too , who never leaves her own underground domicile : geophilus persephones , or " persephone , " named for the greek goddess of the underworld , per livescience . that species was discovered in southern france in 1999 , the study notes . hades has a couple of features that scientists believe emerged as evolutionary adaptation traits , including long claws at the end of its 33 pairs of legs ( perhaps so it can cling to rocks ) and the ability to withstand the caves ' chilly temps , which can hover in the 30s . how they migrated to these underground dwellings in the first place is n't certain , but the lead author of the study tells livescience that it could have been " a dramatic change in the outside temperatures and overall conditions that forced less-adaptive organisms to seek shelter underground where the conditions are more stable and less dependent on the outside fluctuations . " ( a centipede bite could provide more pain relief than morphine . )
