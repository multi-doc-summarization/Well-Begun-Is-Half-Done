kellyanne conway says she was just trying to capture a big moment , not create one . in an interview on lou dobbs tonight on tuesday , the white house adviser says the viral photo of her kneeling on an oval office couch simply caught her doing what she was asked : " what happened is we had the largest gathering of men and women to date in the oval office for a picture ... i was being asked to take a picture in a crowded room with the press behind us , and i was asked to take a certain angle and was doing exactly that , " she told dobbs . " i certainly meant no disrespect . i did n't mean to have my feet on the couch . " then she flipped the criticism on its head : " if we started a trend here , where people are outwardly talking about greater respect for the office of the president and its current occupant , then perhaps that â€™ s something positive to come out " of this . and in emails to the washington post , conway tried to shift the attention back where she felt it should be : " on the actual visit and the incredible , important work of these men and women at [ historically black colleges and universities ] . " trump aide omarosa manigault , who was present , also framed the moment to the post , calling it " very sweet ... to be honest . she looked down at the picture after she got it , and i looked at her and said , 'kellyanne , did you get a good shot ? ' ... she tried again ; she positioned herself to get a better picture . it really was at my encouragement for her to try to capture such an important , historic moment .
