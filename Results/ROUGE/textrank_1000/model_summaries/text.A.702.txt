a drug-sniffing colombian police dog with nearly 250 arrests under her collar recently tracked down more than 10 tons of coke from a major drug gang . the gang 's reaction : a bounty on the pooch 's head that may be up to $ 70,000 . the telegraph reports that sombra ( spanish for " shadow " ) has had to be moved from the drug-trafficking hot spot of turbo , in colombia 's uraba region , to the relatively safer el dorado international airport in bogota after what the bbc calls the country 's " most powerful criminal organization " decided she should be killed . the 6-year-old german shepherd also now has a dedicated security detail , with extra officers keeping her and her handler safe from the urabeños , aka the gulf clan . the washington post notes sombra , who has been with the national police of colombia since she was a puppy , is " something of a folk hero " in the country due to her legendary drug busts , with local media dubbing her " the terror " of narcotics traffickers . the " friendly , calm canine " often shows up on tv and in pictures with fans , and the police boast about her on twitter . which is why urabeños members were enraged enough to offer the bounty , which police intelligence reports note could range anywhere from $ 7,000 to $ 70,000 . " the fact they want to hurt sombra and offer such a high reward for her capture or death shows the impact she 's had on their profits , " a police rep tells the telegraph . ( sometimes drug-sniffing dogs face danger from the drugs themselves . )
