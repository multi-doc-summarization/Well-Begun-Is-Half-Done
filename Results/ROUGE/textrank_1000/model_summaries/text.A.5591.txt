environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt says he needs to fly first-class because of a toxic environmentâ€”the political one . he says he was n't involved in the decision to put him in first class when he travels , which he says was made after some unpleasant interactions with travelers opposed to administration policies . " we live in a very toxic environment politically , particularly around issues of the environment , " he tells the new hampshire union leader . he says his security team and the administration " place me on the plane where they think [ it 's ] best from a safety perspective . " he was speaking days after the washington post reported that pruitt , whose predecessors mostly flew coach , has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in first-class and military jet travel costs , including $ 90,000 during a busy stretch in early june . pruitt 's government-funded travel is being reviewed by the epa 's internal watchdog , which says the results of its investigation should be released by the summer , the ap reports . earlier this week , epa spokesman jahan wilcox claimed pruitt had a " blanket waiver " allowing him to choose first class whenever he travels , but he retracted the statement after politico pointed out that federal rules require a waiver for every taxpayer-funded first-class trip when it 's for security reasons . wilcox , whose earlier statement was criticized by both democrats and republicans , now says pruitt " submits a waiver to fly in either first or business class " for every trip he makes . ( pruitt is the first epa chief to be accompanied by a 24-hour security detail . )
