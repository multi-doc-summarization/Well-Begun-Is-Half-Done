thanks to the cassini spacecraft , we already knew that one of saturn 's moons has a big ocean . now things have gotten more interesting on enceladus . it turns out that the ocean is not only warm , it seems to have the same kind of hydrothermal activity going on as oceans on earth , reports nasa . bottom line : " this may be the place to go look for life in the outer solar system , " says a cornell scientist not involved with the new study in nature . that would be microbial life , under conditions similar to those in a network of hot springs under the atlantic ocean known as the " lost city , " reports ap . some scientists think that ancient hydrothermal field yielded the first life on our planet . some extra-terrestrial sleuthing resulted in the enceladus discovery : knowing that a geyser shooting up from the moon 's south pole sends up dust particles that settle on saturn 's outer ring , researchers analyzed the outer ring . they discovered that the dust particles were mostly silica , explains popular mechanics , and the makeup of that silica yielded details about the ocean in which they were formed . " we think that the temperature at least in some part of the ocean must be higher than 190 degrees fahrenheit , " team member sean hsu tells npr . " if you could swim a little bit further from the really hot part then it could be comfy . " the only way to " nail the habitability question " is to send up a new spacecraft to enceladus with more modern instruments , says the cornell researcher . he 's already working on the proposal .
