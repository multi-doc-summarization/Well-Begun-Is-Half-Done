retired ohio police officer matt hickey will get to keep his k9 partner , ajax , but he " escalated the situation by being disingenuous , " his former boss says , per the new york daily news . marietta police chief rodney hupp says hickey—who announced he would have to bid on his " family member " after retiring from the force last week—has been appointed an auxiliary officer , meaning ajax can remain with him . hupp calls the move " a win-win for everyone , " but he says it was in the works since thursday , when hickey told the media he feared losing his dog . while police were bound by a confidentiality agreement , " you could have stopped this train wreck , simply by saying , 'they 're working on a solution , ' " hupp told hickey at a monday press conference . " i 'm ashamed of you , " hickey responded from the crowd . " you 're making up small lies . " hupp admits there 's " bad blood , " but that wo n't affect hickey 's status as an auxiliary officer or his ability to keep ajax . some $ 69,000 raised to help hickey pay for the dog will now be given to charities that work with police dogs , reports cnn .
