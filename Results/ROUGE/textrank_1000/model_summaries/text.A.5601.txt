janet yellen is getting a lot of grief over her first news conference as leader of the federal reserve for , of all things , speaking too clearly . as rex nutting at marketwatch observes , yellen spoke for an hour yesterday , " but the market only heard three words : 'around six months . ' " those words came when yellen was asked when the fed might start raising interest rates once its tapering strategy ended . the official fed statement on the matter was predictably vague , but yellen was n't : “ you know , this is the kind of term it ’ s hard to define , but , you know , it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing. ” the markets interpreted that to mean interest rates would go up sooner than expected and immediately tanked . " a more experienced central-bank head would have obfuscated and said something vague , " writes john cassidy at the new yorker . he calls yellen 's debut " awkward , " but notes that ben bernanke and alan greenspan got similarly tripped up in their early days . yellen was n't trying to change policy , and investors drew a " remarkably dumb conclusion " in thinking otherwise , writes clive crook at bloomberg . still , yellen needs to be careful in what she says . " investors always want more information , but they 're not always good at sifting useful information from noise , " he writes . " the fed could help them by recognizing that sometimes less is more . " adds peter coy at businessweek , referring to the fed 's rate-setting committee : " it ’ s a fair bet that other fomc members will be suggesting to yellen that she stick closer to the script next time she addresses reporters .
