got a big day ahead ? you 're better off thinking you slept well , even if you did n't , a study suggests . researchers told subjects a normal night of sleep consisted of about 20 % to 25 % rem sleep . less than 20 % , the subjects heard , meant a worse performance on cognitive tests , while more than 25 % meant scoring well on such tests , the telegraph reports . researchers duped these subjects into believing that sensors attached to their bodies were tracking their sleep quality . after a night 's sleep , some subjects were told they spent 16.2 % of the night in rem sleep , while others were informed they 'd spent 28.7 % of the night in rem . that was all made up , the smithsonian reports . next , the subjects took tests involving adding numbers . subjects who 'd been told they 'd slept poorly did worse on the tests , reports blogger eric horowitz . those who heard they slept well did better , the independent reports . in other words , the subjects experienced a " placebo sleep " effect . indeed , the effect is n't limited to pills : we can get placebo exercise , too , the smithsonian notes .
