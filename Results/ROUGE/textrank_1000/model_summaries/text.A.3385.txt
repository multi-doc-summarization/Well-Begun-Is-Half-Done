us consumers throw out or otherwise waste 1.3 billion pounds of edible seafood every year—that 's more than a quarter of the country 's annual supply , according to a press release from john hopkins center for a livable future . those numbers come from a new study published in global environmental change that found up to 47 % of the us ' edible seafood supply goes uneaten every year . some of that is the fault of fishermen catching the wrong species or product lost during distribution and retail . but the majority of the waste—51 % to 63 % —is squarely the fault of consumers . the 2.3 billion pounds of edible seafood that goes uneaten is enough protein to sustain more than 10 million people for a year . the findings are especially important now , with experts encouraging us residents to eat more seafood in lieu of chicken , beef , or other meats , according to the researchers . unfortunately , a number of factors—including overfishing and climate change—are destroying the world 's seafood supply . " if we 're told to eat significantly more seafood but the supply is severely threatened , it is critical and urgent to reduce waste of seafood , " the study leader says in the press release . researchers suggest packaging seafood in smaller portions or encouraging consumers to buy frozen seafood . time reports the new study fits with the federal government 's plan—announced last week—to reduce food waste by 50 % by 2030 . “ let 's feed people , not landfills , ” the epa said at the time .
