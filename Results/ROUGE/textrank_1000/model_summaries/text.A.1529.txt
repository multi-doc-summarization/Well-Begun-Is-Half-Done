" i was n't trying to change the genre , i was just trying to write what i thought , what was interesting to me , " nixon told npr in 2010 . the washington post asserts that she " quietly made soap operas relevant , " noting that a story line she wrote about a guiding light character 's uterine cancer in 1962 is considered the first health plot in a daytime drama . alumni of her shows have responded to nixon 's death with an outpouring of love , support , and admiration , notes the los angeles times , which rounds up examples of the tributes to the woman known as " amazing agnes . " lucci , for instance , writes that she is " devastated " but " forever grateful . " nixon died of pneumonia , a complication of her parkinson 's disease .
