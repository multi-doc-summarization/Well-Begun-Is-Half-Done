it 's not every day that a tycoon 's feces are tested by the authorities , but such is the case in thailand . wildlife officials accuse premchai karnasuta—ranked by forbes as the country 's 35th richest person , with an estimated net worth of $ 240 million—of poaching a leopard and other animals in the thungyai naresuan wildlife sanctuary in the country 's west . afp reports rangers came up on the camp set up by premchai , 63 , and three others and found 10 carcasses of protected species , including a black leopard , a kalij pheasant , and a red muntjac . the group was arrested feb. 4 , reports the bangkok post . human excrement was found there , too , and officials say that its presence near the camp is noteworthy . they do n't believe premchai—who made his fortune in construction and heads the italian-thai development company , which erected bangkok 's suvarnabhumi airport—would have strayed far from the camp when nature called . it 's not the only test being conducted : elephant tusks found in his bangkok home will be analyzed to determine whether they came from africa illegally . the post reports on another potential clue : two pellets identified via x-ray in the pheasant carcass will be tested and compared to the firearms taken from the suspects , who have denied the allegations . premchai has a march 26 court date ; wary of any potential attempt to flee , thailand 's immigration checkpoints have been told to keep watch for him .
