it seems americans are safest from gun-related injuries and deaths when thousands of gun owners are busy attending the nra 's annual convention , ars technica reports . an analysis published thursday in the new england journal of medicine found gun-related injuries dropped 20 % nationwide during annual nra conventions between 2007 and 2015 and 63 % in the states hosting the conventions . these reductions were seen despite no corresponding reduction in crime rates . the biggest drop in gun injuries was for men living in states with high levels of gun ownership in the south and west . " the drop in gun injuries during these large meetings attended by thousands of well-trained gun owners seems to refute the idea that gun injuries stem solely from lack of experience and training in gun use , " analysis author dr. jena anupam tells cnn . jennifer baker , the director of public affairs for the nra , says the analysis " is another example of when data and numbers fly in the face of logic and common sense . " but the chair of emergency medicine at the medical college of wisconsin tells reuters it " passes the sniff test . " " it makes sense that decreased exposure and decreased usage would result in fewer events , " says dr. stephen hargarten , who was n't involved in the analysis . anupam says it 's possible nra conventions have an outsize impact on gun injuries and deaths because attendees are the most intense users of guns . so it 's good news for the safety of americans then—at least for the few days of the year when there 's an nra convention—that time is reporting a spike in nra memberships in the wake of the parkland shooting and ensuing conversation about gun control .
