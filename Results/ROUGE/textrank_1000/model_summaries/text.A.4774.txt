president trump says california wo n't get its border wall until the entirety of the wall is approved for construction . california is almost certainly ok with that . “ i have decided that sections of the wall that california wants built now will not be built until the whole wall is approved , ” reuters quotes trump as tweeting on wednesday . but it 's unclear exactly why trump thinks california wants a border wall , as the state sued the federal government to stop construction of said wall . in fact , in the very same tweet trump referred to the lawsuit after a federal judge ruled against the state of california and environmental groups . “ big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed , " he tweeted . " our country must have border security ! ” california and environmental groups argued john kelly , then secretary of homeland security , overstepped his powers when he waived environmental reviews for the border wall , which experts say could harm threatened and endangered species , nbc news reports . us district court judge gonzalo curiel ruled they were n't able to prove that . if the name sounds familiar , it 's because curiel is the same " mexican " judge trump claimed could n't be objective because of his heritage , according to politico . trump also called curiel , who was born in indiana , a " hater " and " very hostile . " curiel ruled a decision on the wall should be left up to politicians , not the courts . " it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices , ” he wrote in his decision .
