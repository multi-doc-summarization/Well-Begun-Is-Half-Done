round two of the solar impulse 's toughest leg is under way . after the solar plane 's first attempt to cross the pacific was interrupted a month ago , flight engineers spotted what the japan times calls a " possible cloudless stretch . " that allowed pilot andre borschberg to take off from japan 's nagoya airfield at 3:04am local time bound for kalaeloa , hawaii . the team announced the plane was to depart only an hour before it did so . borschberg has since " passed the point of no return , " meaning he ca n't return to japan if he encounters bad weather , according to the project 's website , per the bbc . if successful , the leg will be the longest-duration solo flight in aviation history at 120 hours and the furthest distance flown by a strictly-solar aircraft at 4,900 miles . prior to starting this leg on a trip around the world , the impulse 2 had flown about 5,000 miles . co-pilot bertrand piccard is next set to fly the plane from hawaii to phoenix before the plane eventually arrives on the eastern seaboard . the impulse 2 will then attempt an atlantic crossing , though any further delays could seriously hamper the trip . the team optimally needs to traverse that ocean before the peak of hurricane season in august . the plane had been scheduled to take off from japan last week , but had to cancel at the last moment due to weather . ( discover how borschberg will cope during the lengthy pacific flight . )
