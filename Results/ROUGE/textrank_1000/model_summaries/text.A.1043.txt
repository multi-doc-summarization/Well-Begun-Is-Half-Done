the texas board of education says it 's trying to " streamline " the social studies curriculum in its public schools , and one way it plans on doing so is by getting rid of two big names from the required learning plan . the dallas morning news reports that on friday , the board held a preliminary vote and decided to nix hillary clinton from high school history class . as the first woman to nab a major political party 's presidential nomination , clinton appeared alongside thurgood marshall and sandra day o'connor , among others , in a " citizenship " section of the curriculum in which students were tasked to " evaluate the contributions of significant political and social leaders in the united states . " a work group made its recommendations to the board based on a rubric it created on how " essential " it was to learn about certain historical figures . also cut , but from the elementary school curriculum : helen keller . " helen keller does not best represent the concept of citizenship , " the group wrote . " military and first responders are best represented . " by the group 's gauge , clinton received just 5 points out of 20 ; keller got 7 . some wonder how much time will really be saved by nixing these notable figures . " it wo n't take that long to teach about either woman . they happen to be part of history , " tweeted pundit greta van susteren . the work group estimates cutting clinton will save about 30 minutes of teaching time , while yanking keller will free up 40 . what the boe voted to keep in the state curriculum : references to " judeo-christian values " and " a requirement that students explain how the 'arab rejection of the state of israel has led to ongoing conflict ' in the middle east , " per the morning news . these decisions are n't set in stone : there 's still a chance for the boe to make changes before a final november vote .
