a new jersey police officer has resigned after saying that he can ignore a citizen 's constitutional rightsâ€”because president obama has already " decimated the friggin ' constitution . " special police officer richard recine made the heated remark monday in a confrontation with a resident of helmetta , nj , who had been seen taking photos inside a municipal building , my central jersey reports . the resident , steve wronko , told recine he had a constitutional right to snap the shots . " obama has decimated the friggin ' constitution , so i do n't give a damn , " said recine . " because if he does n't follow the constitution we do n't have to . " what 's more , recine 's comments were all captured on video ( warning : foul language ) . an internal affairs investigation quickly followed , and police director robert manney called recine 's words an " embarrassment . " manney said the probe should wrap up " very swiftly " since " the evidence is right there . " recine , a 59-year-old part-time officer , told my central jersey why he resigned : " i do n't want to give a black eye to law enforcement , " he said . " i do n't want all officers painted with the same brush . " wronko 's wife said the whole thing started because she and her husband were trying to reform the borough animal shelter , which had given them a sick puppy that ended up costing thousands of extra dollars in veterinary services .
