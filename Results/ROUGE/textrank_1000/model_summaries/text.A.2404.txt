tired of wimpy cappuccinos and limp lattes ? now you can jump-start your day with the " world 's strongest coffee . " at least that 's the claim of the not-so-subtly-named black insomnia , which contends it has scientific proof its brew packs multiple times the punch of a normal cup of joe . the south african newcomer boasts it has achieved " dangerously high levels of caffeine " by harvesting only robusta beans , rather than the tamer arabica variety . as for taste , which seems beside the point , the brand promises " a nice walnut and almost sweet taste profile , " with nary a trace of " a burnt and high acidic flavor . " you can be the judge ( kind of ) : the company announced its beans went on sale in the us via amazon last friday , but it 's currently listed as unavailable . it 's apparently a hot contest for the global title of strongest coffee , with companies such as death wish in the running . food & wine gives context with this math : caffeine informer lists 351mg of caffeine in a 6-ounce cup of black insomnia , compared with 330mg for death wish . that 's skirting the maximum 400mg per day that the mayo clinic recommends for " healthy adults . " a normal cup packs a relatively paltry 70mg . founder sean kristafor claims to have essentially reached the upper limit , with a press release warning competitors against attempting to " surpass this content in the interest of public health and safety . " further , he notes that while developing his coffee , " any blend that resulted in a higher caffeine content than 702mg [ per 12 ounces ] adversely affected the flavor and thus was rejected . " ( these students were given potentially lethal doses of caffeine . )
