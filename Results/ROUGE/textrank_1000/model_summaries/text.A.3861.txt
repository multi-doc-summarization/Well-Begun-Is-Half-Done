it 's been nearly a quarter-century since nevest coleman helped powerwash and pull back the tarp at comiskey park , the chicago white sox stadium now known as guaranteed rate field . but the 49-year-old is back on the job , after 23 years behind bars for a crime he did n't commit . the chicago tribune reports coleman , whose conviction for a 1994 rape and murder was overturned in november after dna evidence cleared him , would often watch his former groundskeeping colleagues taking care of the rain-delay tarp on tv in prison , and once released , he talked fondly about his old role at the stadium . " i 'd wake up in the morning proud to go to work , " he tells the tribune . " i loved it . " when the white sox got wind of his desire to return , they called him in for an interview , and to coleman 's delight he got the gig , which started monday , per cbs news . the head groundskeeper greeted him with : " i saved your spot for you . i knew you 'd be back , " per the tribune . as for the white sox , they said in a statement , " we 're grateful that after more than two decades , justice has been carried out for nevest . it has been a long time , but we 're thrilled that we have the opportunity to welcome him back to the white sox family . " coleman , who kept his mind occupied in prison by reading the game of thrones and harry potter books , among others , is now looking forward to spending time with his kids ( whom he left on the outside when they were babies ) and grandkids and getting used to all the changes at the park . and he 's done looking back at the past , per cbs chicago . " if i 'm happy , everybody else will be happy , " he says . " i do n't have time to be miserable , you know ? "
