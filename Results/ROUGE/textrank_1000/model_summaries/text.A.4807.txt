heartbreaking details about peaches geldof 's final moments are trickling out : the sun reports that her 11-month-old son , phaedra , was near her , playing , when her body was found . " the hope is that phaedra is so young he wasn â€™ t aware of what was going on , " says a source , according to radar . geldof 's husband , thomas cohen , was out of town with their other son , astala , at the time . he asked a friend to check on his wife when she did n't answer her phone . meanwhile , you may have heard the daily mail-fueled rumors that " juice fasting " could have been a factor in geldof 's death , as well as concern over how thin geldof was in recent days . but in a 2011 interview that was previously unpublished , geldof slammed rumors that she was anorexic , e ! reports . " do i really look that thin ? let 's be honest . how did i do it ? i just stopped eating mcdonald 's and f -- -ing s -- - every day , " she said , adding that she was much less healthy before : " i had the heart of a 90-year-old gangster . ... people are like , 'peaches is scary and anorexic . ' not really . it 's ridiculous . " ( but , of course , that did n't stop a doctor not involved in the case from speculating that geldof may have been bulimic . )
