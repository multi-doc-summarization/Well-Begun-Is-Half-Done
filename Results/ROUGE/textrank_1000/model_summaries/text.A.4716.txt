' " the statement elaborates on his meetings with investment firms silver lake , goldman sachs , and morgan stanley , and musk says his initial assertion that the funding was there was " reinforced . " but " after considering all these factors " —including institutional investors , who said internal rules limit how much they can put into a private company— " i met with tesla ’ s board of directors yesterday and let them know that i believe the better path is for tesla to remain public .
