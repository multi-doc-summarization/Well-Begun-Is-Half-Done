" here we are taking some control of the process as citizens , " walter madison , a lawyer for the rice family , tells the times . " we are going to participate without even changing the law , " he adds , noting that similar cases that went to grand juries ended up " unfavorable to the families . " community leaders say that there 's a conflict of interest in officer-involved shooting cases because cops work closely with prosecutors , the times notes , but authorities say the rice case will end up before a grand jury even if there is an arrest . a spokesman for the prosecutor tells cleveland.com that the grand jury " ultimately makes the charging decision in all fatal use of deadly force cases that involve law enforcement officers . " in a statement to fox 8 , the chief of the cleveland police patrolmen 's association called the move an " attempt to totally disrespect and disregard our justice system " and warned such efforts would worsen the " increasing lawlessness of an emboldened criminal element .
