the mayor of florence says some tourists have no " decorum " these days—something he hopes to fix with a water hose . mayor dario nardella says a small number of the italian city 's 12 million annual tourists—particularly day-trippers from cruise ships—have taken to " camping out " on church steps at lunchtime . they " sit down on church steps , eat their food , and leave rubbish strewn on them , " with no respect for " our cultural heritage , " nardella tells the guardian . he says city officials thought about handing out fines to such tourists , but they decided instead to get creative . the plan : use water hoses to soak church steps . that way , if tourists sit down , " they 'll get wet , " nardella said in announcing the strategy wednesday . shortly after the announcement , the steps of both the basilica of santa croce and the chiesa di santo spirito were doused . in the future , this will be a daily occurrence , reports the telegraph . " instead of imposing fines , we thought this measure was more elegant , " nardella tells the guardian , adding other areas might eventually get a wash as well . while some social media users joked that a free shower might be nice in the heat of summer , others have accused city officials of being " elitist " in targeting tourists who choose not to eat in florence 's restaurants , per the local . nardella counters that the city has plenty of outdoor seating for tourists . churches , however , are no place for a picnic , he says . ( barcelona has an issue with its tourists , too . )
