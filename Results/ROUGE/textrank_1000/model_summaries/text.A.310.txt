american journalist austin tice—believed to be the only us reporter held hostage anywhere in the world—was captured in syria in august 2012 . since then , us hostages james foley , peter kassig , kayla mueller , and steven sotloff have been killed , and their families fear tice 's parents will soon have to share in their heartbreak . " we are four families bonded together by tragedy and terror , " they write in an open letter to obama at mcclatchy . " but there is something that still can be done : bring austin tice safely home . " the letter comes a year after obama promised the us would improve on how it dealt with hostages . " you told us in person that if it were your daughters , you would do anything in your power to bring them home , " says the letter . " we are not asking the white house to put anyone in harm 's way , nor compromise national security , " but to " engage boldly and use all appropriate means to bring austin tice safely home as soon as possible . " the editorial board of the sacramento bee is backing the families . " the us military has a solemn creed : no soldier left behind , " it writes . " the same should hold true for austin tice . " a state department rep tells mcclatchy that tice 's case " has the attention of the highest levels in the us government and the administration . "
