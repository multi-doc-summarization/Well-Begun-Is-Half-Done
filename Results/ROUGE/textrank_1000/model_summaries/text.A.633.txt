" many states and many cities are closing their mental health facilities and closing them down , and they 're closing them because they do n't have the funding . and we have to start looking much stronger into mental health , " he said . on nbc 's meet the press on sunday , trump explained that gun control would n't help because " they can be sick as hell and they ’ re geniuses in a certain way . they are going to be able to break the system. ” he also told nbc that to avoid copycat killings , the media should have followed the local sheriff 's advice and refused to name the gunman after the mass shooting in oregon . at the nashville rally , trump spoke against " gun-free zones , " saying people " would have been a hell of a lot better off " if there had been " teachers with guns in that room " during the oregon shooting , and said that since he has a handgun carry permit in new york , anyone who attacks him is in for a surprise , cnn reports . he brought up charles bronson 's death wish , got the audience to chant the name of the movie , and said : " today you can ’ t make that movie because it ’ s not politically correct , " reports the guardian .
