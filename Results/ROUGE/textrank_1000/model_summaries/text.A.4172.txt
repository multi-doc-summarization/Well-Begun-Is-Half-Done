a massachusetts woman apparently botched some home repairs yesterday and blew her house to smithereens , wbt reports . lucky for laurie beliveau , 52 , she fled her property in taunton , mass. , minutes before the explosion . " we , my son and i , got her a pair of sandals and a glass of water and within about five minutes the house was in flames and the windows exploded , " says paul saltalamacchia , a neighbor who saw her crying for help . seems that beliveau was trying to fix her hot water heater—which was gas-fueled—when she took off the gas shut-off valve , according to fire officials . that allowed gas to leak into the basement and somehow get ignited . " everything caved in , " says taunton deputy fire chief scott dexter . " it 's just a pile of lumber . nothing is salvageable . " according to saltalmacchia and police , beliveau was at home in her bedroom when an initial explosion rocked the house and blew off her closet door , the taunton gazette reports . " she was walking up the street screaming 'help me , help me ! my house exploded ! ' " saltalmacchia says . another neighbor says beliveau was once married but lived alone for years , barely communicating with others and living in apparently unsanitary conditions with dogs and cats . a " rotting-vegetable-type odor " could be smelled out back even after the explosion , the gazette reports . " she should not have been here by herself , " says the neighbor . " it doesn ’ t make sense . "
