a 2-year-old girl was recently given a 50/50 chance of surviving stage 4 neuroblastoma cancer , and dad adam koessler wants to do everything in his power to boost those chances . the australian man started putting cannabis oil in rumer 's food and noticed " extremely beneficial " and even " miraculous " results , he says—but on jan. 2 , he was arrested and charged with supplying dangerous drugs to a person under 16 . while on the cannabis oil ( which does not contain the compound that gets marijuana users high ) , rumer was in less pain , had more energy , and was able to eat , gain weight , and even go outside . " her skin color came back , her eyes were sparkling again , " her father says . " her cancer-ridden little body was alive again . " without the cannabis oil , her condition has declined and she 's in intensive care on morphine , the newcastle herald reports . medical marijuana advocates are standing behind koessler , who—as part of his bail conditions—is not allowed any contact with rumer . the nsw hemp party spokesman points out the fact that rumer was put on opiate painkillers after being forced off cannabis oil and says , " the current legal position regarding the enforced medical treatment of an innocent child is unconscionable . " the cairns community is also rallying behind rumer and her family , donating money toward rumer 's treatment , the cairns post reported last month , shortly after rumer was diagnosed on christmas day . two crowdfunding campaigns have raised more than $ 30,000 , and a change.org petition for koessler to see his parental rights reinstated and medicinal cannabis oil to be decriminalized has more than 157,000 supporters . a facebook page apparently run by rumer 's mother ( her parents are not together , according to her dad 's gofundme page ) says her cancer was recently downgraded to stage 3 . ( this dad credits his son 's recovery from cancer to cannabis oil . )
