scientists have seen a tendril of dark matter for the first time , and all it took was a " cosmic flashlight . " using the keck telescope in hawaii , a scientific team spotted the dark matter in a gas cloud illuminated by the radiation of a distant quasar , the bbc reports . " the light from the quasar is like a flashlight beam , " said sebastiano cantalupo , lead author of the report . lit by that beam , the glowing hydrogen of the gas cloud traced out the dark matter lying behind it . this all supports a theory that galaxies are wrapped up in filaments of gas that stretch across space like a web , national geographic reports . about 85 % of the web is said to be dark matter , nature world news explains , and galaxies sit like spiders on intersections of the web . gravity is what keeps us , and all matter , sitting on these filaments , and now one has actually been observed . it 's " giving us the first picture of extended gas between galaxies , " co-author j. xavier prochaska tells the space reporter . " it provides a terrific insight into the overall structure of our universe . "
