the us and china rank as the world 's two largest polluters , but a surprise deal is turning them into the world 's two largest pollution fighters : the nations announced that they 'll be working in tandem on long-term greenhouse-gas controls that would cut emissions by nearly a third over the next 15 years or so , cnn reports . " as the world 's two largest economies , energy consumers , and emitters of greenhouse gases , we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change , " president obama said in a joint press conference with chinese president xi jinping today at the end of the apec summit . the move , which was months in the making , came as a surprise to experts expecting a much more limited scope , the wall street journal reports . calling it a " game changer , " mother jones notes that it could heavily influence next year 's climate talks in paris . key mandates include the us reducing emissions by 26 % to 28 % by the year 2025 ( compared to the year 2005 ) , as well as doubling the rate of emissions reduction each year between 2020 and 2025 to an average 2.3 % to 2.8 % , the ap reports . china is pledging to stop increasing emissions by 2030 ( even earlier , if possible ) , as well as increase energy from zero-emission sources such as wind , solar , and nuclear to 20 % by 2030 . although some worry about recent gop gains in government as a possible roadblock , a senior administration official tells cnn that " we believe we can proceed with the authority we already have . " secretary of state john kerry writes in a new york times op-ed that " this is â€¦ a milestone in the united states-china relationship , " a " fresh beginning , " and " the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure .
