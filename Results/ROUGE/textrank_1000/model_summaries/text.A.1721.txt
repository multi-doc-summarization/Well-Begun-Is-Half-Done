" the former is exactly what an unnamed senior white house official pointed out , reportedly telling nbc 's kelly o'donnell such rulings do " not undercut the president 's executive order . " the official continues , " all stopped visas will remain stopped . all halted admissions will remain halted . all restricted travel will remain prohibited . ... the order remains in place . " but the pressure shows no sign of easing : the ap reports that the attorneys general of 15 states and the district of columbia will issue a joint statement branding trump 's ban as unconstitutional and at odds with " a bedrock principle " of the us : religious liberty . the states : washington , california , new york , pennsylvania , massachusetts , hawaii , virginia , oregon , connecticut , vermont , illinois , new mexico , iowa , maine , and maryland . what trump had to say sunday morning on twitter : " our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting , now . look what is happening all over europe and , indeed , the world - a horrible mess !
