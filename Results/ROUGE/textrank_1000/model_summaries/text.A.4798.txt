dave sowers ' head-on car collision while on vacation in yellowstone was traumatic enough : he was airlifted and broke his arm , leg , and ribs . but he awoke to the news that his dog jade had fled from park rangers who tried to pull her from the car , and was nowhere to be found . what followed was a 42-day search—complete with fliers , a few dozen volunteers , and gofundme and facebook pages—for the 18-month-old australian shepherd , largely headed up by sowers ' girlfriend , laura gillice , reports the missoulian . but in the end , it was gillice , on a walk with her own dog , laila , who spotted sowers ' canine pal near canyon village . " she just came running to me , like ‘ where ’ ve you been mom ? ' " says gillice . when the trio returned to the hotel where sowers was staying , she says , a " hugfest " ensued . " a lot of people have just dedicated their weekends to looking for her , " says sowers . " it ’ s amazing , we didn ’ t think we ’ d ever see her again . "
