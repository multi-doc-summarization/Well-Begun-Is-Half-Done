the little red hen restaurant in rural virginia found itself squarely in the middle of a big beltway brouhaha after sarah huckabee sanders was turned away on friday night , and now the owner gives the washington post the backstory . stephanie wilkinson was home when her chef called around 8pm to say that sanders had walked in with a group , and wondered what to do . wilkinson drove to the restaurant , confirmed that it was indeed sanders , and asked her staff , " tell me what you want me to do . i can ask her to leave . " wilkinson notes that some of her employees are gay . " they said 'yes . ' " wilkinson says she asked sanders to step outside , and though " i was babbling a little ... i explained that the restaurant has certain standards ... such as honesty , and compassion , and cooperation . " asked to leave , sanders said , " that 's fine . i 'll go . " sanders ' group elected to clear out with her , and offered to pay for their entrees , which were being prepared ; wilkinson opted not to charge the group . usually , politics are n't on the menu at the red hen , wilkinson says . " i â€™ m not a huge fan of confrontation . i have a business , and i want the business to thrive . this feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals . " that business was mired firmly in controversy saturday , with trolls of both flavors clogging the red hen 's yelp page ( which now has two stars ) , its reservation line , and even shouting from the sidewalk in lexington . the restaurant opted not to open saturday night , writing in an email that " we would like to avoid exposing our patrons to any potential unpleasantness from outside entities .
