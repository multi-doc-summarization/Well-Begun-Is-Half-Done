people have thoughts about the new obama portraits , and some are weirder than others . on tuesday , sean hannity 's website pushed perhaps the weirdest of all—that the portrait contained hidden images of sperm . the week quotes from the since-deleted page : " controversy surrounding kehinde wiley 's wildly non-traditional portrait of the commander-in-chief broke out within minutes of its unveiling , with industry insiders claiming the artist secretly inserted his trademark technique—concealing images of sperm within his paintings . " and a since-deleted hannity tweet read , " obama 's portrait - a stark contrast to predecessors with inappropriate sexual innuendo , " per newsweek . the allegation drew quite a bit of attention , and apparently hannity himself was surprised . " earlier today my web staff posted content that was not reviewed by me before publication , " he said in a statement . " it does not reflect my voice and message and , therefore , i had it taken down . " the sperm rumor apparently began circulating on 4chan , and the daily beast appears to have tracked down the original source , a 2008 article in the new york times about artist wiley . that article says his portraits “ initially depicted african-american men against rich textile or wallpaper backgrounds whose patterns he has likened to abstractions of sperm. ” this tweet shows the image making the sperm-conspiracy rounds .
