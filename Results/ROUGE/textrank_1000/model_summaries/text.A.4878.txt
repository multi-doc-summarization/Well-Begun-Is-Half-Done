the families of hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by boko haram two years ago have been given fresh hope by what the nigerian military says is another rescue . a military spokesman says that " miss serah luka , who is number 157 on the list of the abducted schoolgirls , " was among 97 women and children rescued in a raid that killed at least 35 militants , reports the bbc , although a spokesman for the families of the girls kidnapped in the town of chibok denies that she is on the list . the military says luka , a pastor 's daughter who joined the chibok school just two months before the mass kidnapping , is receiving medical treatment , the guardian reports . on tuesday , the military announced that it had rescued missing schoolgirl amina ali nkeki from the militants . since then , she has met with president muhammadu buhari and so many other dignitaries that critics are accusing the government of putting a traumatized girl on parade in an effort to score political points . nkeki was found by vigilantes in the sambisa forest after she ran away from a boko haram camp with a 4-month-old baby and a man she said was her husband . but while she was meeting the president , the husband was being interrogated as a suspected boko haram fighter , cnn reports . some 217 schoolgirls are still missing , and nkeki has reportedly said that they are all still in forest camps , apart from six killed in a recent attack .
