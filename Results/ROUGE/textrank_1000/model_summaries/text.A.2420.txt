a japanese mathematician swears he 's solved one of the biggest problems in the world of math . the problem is , nobody , not even fellow mathematicians of the highest caliber , can understand shinichi mochizuki 's proof of something called the abc conjecture , reports new scientist . it does n't help that the proof itself is 500 pages long or that mochizuki developed his own set of mathematical principles called the inter-universal teichmuller theory that must be mastered first . ( those who do n't are " simply not qualified " to weigh in , says mochizuki . ) mathematicians are n't saying that mochizuki 's resolution of the theory is wrong , but they 're not saying it 's right , either . as a result , it 's been in a kind of math limbo since 2012 , despite attempts by the kyoto university professor as recently as last month to shed light on it . as for the abc conjecture , it 's a longstanding math problem that also happens to be " deceptively complicated , " explains zme science . " it roughly states that three numbers a , b , and c , which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c can not be too smooth . ... in number theory , a smooth number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers . " got that ? the upshot , according to both sites , is that the theory raises fundamental questions about the " nature of numbers , " and thus its proof would be a major milestone . " it 's a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it 's right or wrong , " says oxford professor minhyong kim . ( elsewhere , a beating seems to have turned this man into a math whiz . )
