a mississippi man received a 49-year prison sentence monday for the first-ever conviction on federal hate crime charges arising from the killing of a transgender woman , the ap reports . in a case watched by the lgbt community nationwide , us district judge louis guirola jr. sentenced joshua vallum , 29 , in the 2015 killing of 17-year-old mercedes williamson . it was the first case prosecuted under the federal hate crimes prevention act involving a victim targeted because of gender identity . prosecutors said vallum shocked williamson with a stun gun , stabbed her , and beat her to death to keep fellow latin kings gang members from discovering the two were having sex . gang rules barred homosexual activity and declared it punishable by death . the couple had broken up in 2014 but a friend had recently discovered williamson was transgender , per cnn . guirola could have sentenced vallum to life in prison , but heeded a lesser sentence suggested in a plea agreement between defense attorneys and prosecutors , citing vallum 's neglected childhood and other issues . both the judge and defense lawyers said vallum 's history of abuse as a child had to be considered . vallum pleaded guilty to the federal charges in december . he previously pleaded guilty to a state murder charge that led to a separate sentence of life without parole . on monday , vallum begged forgiveness from williamson 's family and friends , though none of them were presentâ€”only a few reporters , the judge , and vallum 's father and stepmother . " every day , i live with the guilt and regret of my actions , " vallum said . " if i could bring back mercedes by giving up my life , i would gladly do so . "
