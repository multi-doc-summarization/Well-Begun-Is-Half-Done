now that other airlines are jumping on the fees-for-carry-ons band wagon , spirit airlines wants you to be sure and remember that they were the first . the airline is jacking up its carry-on fees , which will now range from between $ 20 a bag all the way up to an eye-popping $ 100 , the south florida sun-sentinel reports . the cheaper rates are for fliers who pay the fee online ; wait until you get to the gate , and it 'll cost you c-note . appalled ? then maybe you should join the burgeoning boycott on facebook . the boycott is n't about bag fees though ; it 's about the airline 's refusal to refund the ticket of 76-year-old veteran jerry meeks , who had to cancel a flight on doctor 's orders because he 's suffering from terminal esophageal cancer , mashable reports . it gets worse : this dying ex-marine was flying in the first place to see his daughter , who was having surgery . as of this writing , the boycott page has more than 20,000 likes .
