the creators of the hotly anticipated microsoft surface rt have touted it as revolutionary , improving upon the toy-like tablets of today by making it functional , with a detachable touch screen and a snappy design . so is it the future of computing ? not yet , most reviewers agree : sam biddle praises the rt 's concept and design in a detailed review at gizmodo that 's worth a full read . but ultimately , he says it 's " not worth your paycheck " in its current form , which retails around $ 600 give or take some pricey add-ons . instead of being both a tablet and a laptop , it 's " really just the worst of both worlds . " it 's also hard to use : " it 's just a half-broken death march up the learning curve . " over at wired , mathew honan loves the look of the machine , and like others , drools over the satisfying " snap " of its razor-thin kickstand . it 's durable too , but the cameras lag and " the image quality looks about like the last photo you snapped with your razr v3 . " pretty much everyone hates the windows rt software the machine runs on . it 's a departure from window 's old operating systemsâ€”it 's colorful and swipe-friendly , for starters . but harry mccracken , writing for cnn , wonders why the new design still includes a desktop . switching between the two interfaces " can be an oddly disjointed experience , as if you 're teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning . " the apps are a big letdown , writes david pogue in the new york times . you ca n't use any ipad or android tablet apps , nor any of microsoft 's own programs . that means no apps for facebook , angry birds , or spotify , among many others , and what is available is " bare-bones junky . " his advice ? wait a few months for the surface pro .
