are aliens living 95 light-years away reaching out to say hello ? ok , probably not , but astronomers are nevertheless intrigued by an unusual signal reported out of russia , reports the observer . it seems to be coming from the general vicinity of an ancient star in the constellation hercules known as hd164595 , which has at least one planet in its orbit . the signal was detected by the ratan-600 radio telescope in zelenchukskaya on may 15 , 2015 , but only just made public in a paper , reports the website centauri dreams . the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has begun looking into it , and " the signal is provocative enough that the ratan-600 researchers are calling for permanent monitoring of this target , " writes paul gilster . the reason it 's generating so many headlines on science websites is that the signal has the hallmarks of one that would come an advanced civilization . after all , it would take an enormous amount of energy to blast it out deliberately , notes space.com . unfortunately for sci-fi fans , the best bet is that the signal is the result of some kind of interference from earth , reports new scientist . it might even come from our own military 's communications , reports ars technica . " could it be another society sending a signal our way ? " asks seti 's seth sostak in a blog post . " of course , that ’ s possible . " but plenty of other explanations exist , and " without a confirmation of this signal , we can only say that it ’ s 'interesting . ' " astronomers will discuss the signal at a seti meeting on sept. 27 . ( seti is also looking for signals from another star . )
