beer drinkers start feeling happy at the smallest sip , even before any alcohol registers , a new study suggests . indiana university researchers found that dopamine levels in the brain rose when drinkers had just a tiny amount of beer , before any alcohol buzz was possible , reports livescience . the not-so-funny part : dopamine levels shot up the most in those who had a family history of alcoholism , suggesting that some kind of hereditary risk factor was at play , reports the los angeles times . " we believe this is the first experiment in humans to show that the taste of an alcoholic drink alone , without any intoxicating effect from the alcohol , can elicit this dopamine activity in the brain 's reward centers , " says the lead author . if the connection to those with a family history of alcoholism holds true , the dopamine test might help gauge the vulnerability of those predisposed to alcohol abuse .
