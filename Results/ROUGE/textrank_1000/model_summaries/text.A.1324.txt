if frank lasee ran for office using his wife 's house as his primary residence , he 'd have to run against incumbent paul ryanâ€”which the milwaukee journal sentinel says would be " political suicide . " instead , the gop state senator looking to fill a soon-to-be-vacant congressional seat says he mainly lives in a de pere apartment in a different district . only problem : he 's listed out the place on airbnb , roll call notes . the listing has since been taken down , but a cached version shows a $ 210-a-month offering for the " luxury apartment , " which journal sentinel reporters actually tried booking in april . they dealt with amy joy lasee , frank 's wife , who asked why they wanted to stay there and ultimately denied their request . why did they pull the listing ? " because we wanted to , " says lasee , who adds that they did n't want " everyone in the world looking at it . " he then described a " crazy living arrangement " involving him mostly shacking up at the apartment and sometimes in racine . this is n't new for lasee , who had to produce a lease in 2014 when pressed by democrats wanting evidence that he was n't subletting the apartment . in a response to the state 's government accountability board , he said custody arrangements and the challenges of a " blended family " forced him to retain both residences . yet he has switched his official residence a few times between racine and de pere during various divorce and child custody proceedings . lasee chalks the whole hubbub up this time around to " a campaign issue . "
