charlo greene made headlines in 2014 when the then 26-year-old memorably quit her tv reporting gig on air while announcing her intention to push for the legalization of marijuana in alaska : she said , " f -- - it , i quit , " before walking out of view . but as the guardian reports , her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored , even though she faces more than a half-century in prison . that 's because greene , whose legal name is charlene egbe , is n't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the alaska cannabis club , which she created on april 20 , 2014 , a full six months before alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis . in other words , she was receiving " donations " for marijuana through club " memberships " before it was legal to do so . police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases , and though greene was n't directly involved in them , state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name . she 's pleaded not guilty to charges of " misconduct involving a controlled substance , " and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail . the guardian broke the news to greene that six offenses have since been added , raising the total to 54 years . in the weed blog , greene calls this a " modern-day lynching , " and tells high times that she hopes the cannabis community rallies behind her . " i need help more than ever , " she says . " now that i could lose the rest of my life because of cannabis , it feels like the people i fought for have abandoned me . " ( alaskans ca n't smoke weed in public . )
