facebook plans to join forces with spotify , mog , and rdio to launch its long-rumored music service later this month , sources tell mashable . facebook won ’ t unveil the project until the sept. 22 f8 developer conference , but it ’ s been a poorly kept secret—evidence of it was found hidden in the code for facebook ’ s video chat . unlike apple , google , and amazon , facebook won ’ t actually host any music , one source said—it ’ ll just be a platform for the aforementioned partners . while mashable reports it 's not clear if other music purveyors will be included at launch , one source noted that facebook doesn ’ t like to play favorites , and will likely open the music platform to third parties , much as it does with applications and games . to wit , reuters adds that rhapsody and slacker are also involved . another rumor : that the platform could one day be expanded to stream video as well . facebook , however , wouldn ’ t confirm the report , saying , “ there ’ s nothing new to announce . ”
