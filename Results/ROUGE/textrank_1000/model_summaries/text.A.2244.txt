new york city cops have literally turned their backs on mayor de blasio and jeered him in public , and , as the new york post reports , they now seem to be engaging in a " virtual work stoppage " in terms of arrests . some critics , however , say it 's the nypd that 's in the wrong . at gawker today , andy cush delivers this scathing assessment : the department " is too childish and entitled to deserve its privileged status , and too aggrieved and resentful to be called 'new york 's finest . ' the new york police department is an embarrassment to the city of new york . " de blasio 's main offense in the eyes of the nypd came after the non-indictment in the eric garner case , when he said that his son needs to be especially careful around police because he 's black . after the police union blamed the mayor for the subsequent murder of two officers , the new york times made the case that rank-and-file officers deserve better from their union reps. " mr. de blasio isn ’ t going to say it , but somebody has to : with these acts of passive-aggressive contempt and self-pity , many new york police officers , led by their union , are squandering the department ’ s credibility , defacing its reputation , shredding its hard-earned respect , " it says in an editorial . " they have taken the most grave and solemn of civic moments—a funeral of a fallen colleague—and hijacked it for their own petty look-at-us gesture . " on the flip side , a new york post editorial says de blasio still owes the city an apology for " his public insinuations that the nypd is a racist force . " the mayor was meeting today with leaders of the five police unions to try to calm things down .
