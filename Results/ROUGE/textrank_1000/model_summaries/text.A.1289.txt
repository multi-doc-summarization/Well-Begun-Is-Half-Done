pittsburgh international airport is bringing back a tradition that was banned after 9/11 : letting people without tickets go through security to the airside part of the terminal . the airport will allow non-flyers airside to shop , dine , or say goodbye to loved ones at the gate as of tuesday , with the approval of the transportation security administration , reports nbc . pittsburgh is the first airport to allow this since 9/11 , and non-flyers will have to go through the same security checkpoints as travelers . they will also have to go to a special desk to get a " mypitpass , " which will involve producing a photo id and being checked against no-fly lists , reports the new york daily news . christina cassotis , ceo of the allegheny county airport authority , says people have been asking about access to shopping and dining at the airport for years . bob ross , president of the association of professional flight attendants , however , says the change will lead to longer security lines and decreased safety , reports the tribune-review . " allowing the non-flying public to go through security ... for the sole purpose of shopping is a terrible precedent and an ill-conceived decision , " he said in a statement . the tsa says there are no plans for similar programs at other airports .
