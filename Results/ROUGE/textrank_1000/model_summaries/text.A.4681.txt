a full-blown trade war is looking ever more likely with president trump threatening us allies upset with the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports he announced just days earlier , usa today reports . " if the e.u . wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on u.s. companies doing business there , we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the u.s . they make it impossible for our cars ( and more ) to sell there . big trade imbalance ! " trump tweeted saturday from mar-a-lago . the president announced a 25 % tariff on imported steel and 10 % tariff on imported aluminum on thursday . both canada and the eu called the tariffs " unacceptable , " and the eu threatened to retaliate in the form of tariffs on harley-davidson motorcycles , kentucky bourbon , and jeans . canada also threatened retaliation of its own . the us was the largest market for cars exported from the eu in 2016 , importing over 1 million , cnbc reports . according to the washington post , trump 's newest tariff threat mostly targets germany , which exported $ 23 billion in cars to the us in 2016 . germany 's bmw and volkswagen employ thousands of workers in factories in the us , and critics say a tariff on their cars would only hurt us consumers . trump said during his presidential campaign that he wanted to fix trade imbalances with china and mexico . but his announced tariffs on aluminum and steel would mostly affect canada , the uk , germany , south korea , turkey , and japan—all allies of the us . “ none of this is reasonable , but reason is a sentiment that is very unevenly distributed in this world , ” the president of the eu says . trump on friday called trade wars " good and easy to win .
