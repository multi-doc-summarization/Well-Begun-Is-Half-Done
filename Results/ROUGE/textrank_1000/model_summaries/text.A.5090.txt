erik prince says he and blackwater—the defense contractor now known as xe—got a raw deal from the government . " i put myself and my company at the cia 's disposal for some very risky missions , " the firm 's founder tells vanity fair . " but when it became politically expedient to do so , someone threw me under the bus . " marc ambinder of the atlantic says if prince 's venting is correct , it " rips open a closed package of secrets , " specifically about the now-terminated assassination program the company ran in cahoots with the cia . a blackwater team tracked an al-qaeda financier to germany and prepared to kill him , and the cia informed neither its own station office nor german officials . that 's a " serious violation of nato intelligence sharing arrangements , " writes ambinder , and it contradicts leon panetta 's claim that the program was never operational .
