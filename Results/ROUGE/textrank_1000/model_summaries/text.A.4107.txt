the union street guest house in hudson , ny , wants you to keep your crummy opinions to yourself . so if you post something about the hotel ’ s " rude customer service , unclean , terrible odor , " as ny pix 11 quotes one reviewer , the hotel will collect a $ 500 fine . it ’ s right in their policy , which states that customers who ’ ve booked weddings or other events at the hotel will have their deposit deducted for every negative review written by their guests . want your money back ? remove the review ( s ) , the ny post reports . but woe to the reviewer who doesn ’ t remove his complaints—the owners tend to get defensive . when a guest said staff was rude when they asked for ice , the hotel posted a response : " i know you guys wanted to hang out and get drunk for 2 days ... i was so so so sorry that our ice maker and fridge were not working and not accessible . " despite the hotel ’ s efforts , it still has a poor average rating on yelp .
