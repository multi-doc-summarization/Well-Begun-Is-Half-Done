the uss independence has remained submerged a half-mile deep off the coast of california for 65 years , out of human sight since it was purposely relegated to the bottom of the ocean by the us navy in 1951 , reportedly with a bunch of 50-gallon barrels containing radioactive waste , per the mercury news . this week , however , thousands of viewers watched as the first photos other than sonar scans of the 623-foot aircraft carrier were shown live online , courtesy of the same ocean explorer who discovered the titanic , among other famous shipwrecksâ€”and those pics show the independence is in remarkably good shape in its watery grave . " there 's very little change from when the navy scuttled it , " robert ballard says of his team 's documentation , in conjunction with the navy and the noaa , adding the titanic was similarly well-kept . " the deep sea is the largest museum on earth . " viewers saw such wonders as the independence 's sponge-covered flight deck , a grumman hellcat fighter plane , and even the ship 's name imprinted on its hull , all at the same time as researchers on the nautilus exploration vessel , who sent out two remote-controlled submersibles monday and tuesday to capture the pictures about 30 miles west of half moon bay . what the deep-sea dive did n't find : any evidence of the atomic waste rumored to have been sunk with the ship , per usa today , though a uc berkeley nuclear engineering expert tells the mercury news any danger posed by such waste would 've long since dissipated . the 74-year-old ballard says he treated his newest subject with the same respect he does all his shipwrecks , leaving artifacts intact . " taking things off would be like bringing a shovel to gettysburg , " he says . ( sonar images of the independence were first seen last year . )
