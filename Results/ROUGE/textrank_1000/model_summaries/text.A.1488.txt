some media outlets might want to evict donald trump from their politics sections , but he appears to be doing pretty well among americans surveying the political arena . as cnn reports in a new cnn/orc national poll , trump is polling at the top of the considerable heap of republican presidential contenders , at 18 % . jeb bush comes in second at 15 % , scott walker at 10 % , and no other gop candidate cracked double digits . of note : the poll was conducted after trump started swinging at john mccain 's war record , indicating he 's emerged unscathed ; the new poll puts trump up 6 points over a similar poll at the end of june . " there 's a movement going on , " trump told cnn this morning in response , per the hill . " people are tired of these incompetent politicians in washington ... i 'm just not that surprised . " trump is racking up similar numbers in iowa , per an nbc/marist poll out today : he 's at 17 % , though he 's trailing walker 's 19 % in that state , reports politico . bush has 12 % there . the story is a little more marked in new hampshire , where trump is pulling down 21 % to bush 's 14 % and walker 's 12 % . and trump 's divisiveness shows in his unfavorability ratings : 53 % of new hampshire republicans view him unfavorably , notes politico , while that number is 44 % in iowa , and what cnn calls a " sky high " 59 % of all registered voters in its poll .
