cool—and/or creepy—news out of japan , where researchers at the university of tokyo and kyoto university have created a human ear ... on the back of a rat . the researchers used stem cells that grew into ear cartilage , shaping the cells into an ear by putting them in " biological tubing , " discovery news reports . more specifically , they used " induced pluripotent stem cells , " which the national institutes of health explains are " adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state . " the ear-shaped cartilage was implanted under a rat 's skin , where it was allowed to grow for two months ; the tubing dissolved and a 2-inch-long ear was left behind . the researchers believe this technology could be used to treat people who are born with no ears or with smaller-than-normal ears , japan today reports . it could also be used to repair ears disfigured in accidents , discovery adds . in the case of a child born with a missing or misshapen ear , the researchers note that the ear they created is " living , " and thus would develop and grow along with the child . a clinical trial involving humans is expected to start in five years . in 2013 , researchers in boston used sheep cells , bovine collagen , and an ear-shaped titanium wire frame to grow an ear on the back of another rat , discovery notes . ( these creatures can grow the heads and brains of other species . )
