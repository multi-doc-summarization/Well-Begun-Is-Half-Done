miners have been pulling diamonds from a vast area of namibia 's namib desert called the sperrgebiet ( or " forbidden territory " ) for more than a century . but in 2008 , workers hunting for diamonds where the desert meets the atlantic ocean found something even more precious : the likely remains of the bom jesus , a portuguese sailing ship that disappeared some 500 years ago on its way to india . it 's a discovery , per recent coverage by news.com.au , that solved " one of the biggest maritime mysteries . " also , says archaeologist dieter noli , it 's the oldest shipwreck ever found in sub-saharan africa . and there 's treasure as well : included in the find were some 2,000 gold coins from spain and portugal , according to gainesville news . upon unearthing the site of the shipwreck , per cnn , workers found pieces of metal , wood , and what looked like pipes . not sure what they had found , they called in noli . " it just looked like a disturbed beach , " he told cnn earlier this month , " but lying on it were bits and pieces . " among those were a centuries-old musket and an elephant tusk . " i thought , 'oh , no no , this is definitely a shipwreck , ' " noli says . ultimately , in addition to the gold , workers recovered cannons ( the pipes ) , navigational instruments , tons of copper ingots , swords , and a lot moreâ€”some 5,438 artifacts . not much of the actual structure of the ship remains . but archaeologists have matched the cargo with that of the bom jesus ( which means the " good jesus " ) based on details found in a 16th-century book that lists the ship as lost . the stretch of coastline is known for storms . speaking to cnn , noli speculates that the bom jesus " came in , it hit a rock , and it leaned over . " ( a famed shipwreck closer to home is getting a closer look . )
