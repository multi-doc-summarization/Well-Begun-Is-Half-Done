" a park avenue podiatrist , who recommends prada and michael kors for women looking for a wider shoe , offers injectable fillers for cushioning and other injections to tame profuse sweating ; another nyc practitioner corrects what he calls hitchhiker 's toe ( a case of an outsize big toe ) but drew the line at one patient 's request : amputation of a pinkie toe to allow for a better fit . and it 's not a new trend : the times checked in on it in 2003 , focusing on the " perils on the procedures " â€”an elective bunion removal , for instance , that ended up saddling the patient with serious foot pain . time points out that woman are doing other " gross things " for fashion 's sake , like botoxing their calves to make them skinnier , and thereby better suited for skinnyjeans and slim boots . ( and then there are these 7 people , who went under the knife in an attempt to look like a celeb . )
