youtube channels are facing a reckoning : as it seeks to make the site more television-like , google is launching a second round of investments in youtube channelsâ€”but only 30 % to 40 % are likely to get a new installment of cash , an exec tells advertising age . at the moment , youtube has 160 channels . but a year after beginning the funding process , the site now has a clearer sense of which ones are on the road to success . the new funding will be based on viewership hours , as opposed to number of views or how much cash a channel is generating , fast company notes . " our biggest objective was to kick-start the ecosystem , to bring in great creators , to deepen our relationships with advertisers and to grow viewership , " says content exec jamie byrne , who 's helming the process . if channels do n't get funding , it 's not the end : they can stick around , and youtube bosses are hoping content makers will keep at it , allthingsd reports . channels that do get funding are looking at similar figures to those in the first round of investment : between $ 1 million and $ 5 million . it 's a tough gig for the channel 's producers , notes ad age : before they start selling their own ads , they have to pay back youtube 's investment .
