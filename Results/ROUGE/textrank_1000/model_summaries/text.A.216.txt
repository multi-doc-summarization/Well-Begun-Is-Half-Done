well , this is awkward : robert pattinson was spotted driving to his house with a " mystery girl " sunday , and she 's now been ided as model/actress riley keough . that 's notable for three reasons : keough is the granddaughter of elvis presley . she co-starred with pattinson ex kristen stewart in the runaways . ( pattinson and stewart most recently split in may . ) she 's close friends with stewart , according to the new york daily news . in fact , she attended stewart 's april birthday party , as did pattinson . so , are keough and pattinson dating ? most outlets seem to be spinning it that way ( a source tells the ever-trustworthy daily mail the two are " inseparable , " while another tells hollywood life that rob " is so happy that he can trust someone again " ) . but x17 notes that maybe she was actually running interference for kristen , trying to reunite the twilight lovers .
