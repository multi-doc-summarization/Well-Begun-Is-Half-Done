google will no longer offer a search suggestion for " are jews evil " which directs users to anti-semitic websites . the search engine says it has removed offensive autocomplete results initially spotted by carole cadwalladr at the observer , reports the guardian . cadwalladr explained how google suggested a search for " are jews evil " when " are jews " was typed into its search box . typing " are women " and " are muslims " returned " are women evil " and " are muslims bad , " cadwalladr said . clicking those suggestions took her to page results that would lead one to conclude that " jews are evil . women are evil . islam must be destroyed . hitler was one of the good guys , " cadwalladr added . an answer box highlighted by google even explained that " every woman has some degree of prostitute in her . " a data scientist urged google to take action , noting it had " clearly become a conduit for right-wing hate sites " and a victim of " the troll army , " per the guardian . " it is clearly very frightening what is going on here . " most of the offensive autocomplete results spotted by cadwalladr have since been erased— " are women equal to men " was among them , per cbs news—though " are muslims bad " is still a suggestion . google says it tries " to prevent offensive terms , like porn and hate speech , from appearing , " but " autocomplete predictions are algorithmically generated based on users ' search activity and interests " and " may be unexpected or unpleasant . " that said , " we acknowledge that autocomplete is n't an exact science and we 're always working to improve our algorithms . " ( google previously suggested wisconsin was " stupid . " )
