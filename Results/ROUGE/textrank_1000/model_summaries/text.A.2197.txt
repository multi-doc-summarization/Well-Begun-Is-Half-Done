from the annals of classy guys : a tennesee man is accused of stealing a woman 's car to use on a date with her godsister that same night , the commercial appeal reports . kelton griffin , 21 , allegedly took out faith pugh last weekend in her black volvo because he had no wheels himself . " he just out of the blue texted me and asked me to go out , " pugh tells wreg . and when they did , she says , " he asked me could i go in the gas station for him to get a cigar . " emerging from said station , she saw no griffin and no car . picked up by her mother , pugh says she got a text from her godsisterâ€”saying griffin had asked her on a date . pugh and her mom apparently followed them via gps on her godsister 's phone , and found the pair watching a movie at a drive-in . " he let her drive , " says pugh , " so she drove him to the drive-in . he did n't even have any money . she actually paid their way to get in the drive-in just so i could get my car back . " griffin was soon arrested by memphis police and charged with property theft , per lex 18 . police say he 's been arrested before , for robbing a restaurant with two other men in 2016 . seems pugh is n't exactly waiting for his call : " i hope he 's in jail for a long time , " she says . " i never want to speak to him ever again . "
