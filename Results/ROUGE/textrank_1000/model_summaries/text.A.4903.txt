robert samuel is a professional time-killer . as the founder and ceo of same ole line dudes ( or sold ) in new york , he 'll keep your place in line to ensure you get your hands on " iphones , the latest air jordans , or the hottest broadway tix in town . " sold has even helped new yorkers with brunch waitlists , sample sales , and passports . and because he 's paid for his time— $ 25 for the first hour , and $ 10 for every half-hour thereafter—long lines are likely a lot more welcome to him than they are to the rest of us . in fact , samuel recently made nearly $ 1,000 when he spent 48 hours at the very head of the line for the iphone 6 , reports salon , which calls the business part of the " uber-ization of everything . " since starting sold after getting laid off in 2012 , samuel now has 15 employees . he says he makes up to $ 1,000 a week , though the new york times notes that because his business is " cyclical , " he currently also has a full-time job as a security guard . the line-waiting does n't always sound pleasant . sold employee adonis porch tells salon he 's had to wait in hot weather , freezing weather , rain , sleet , and snow . samuel says that while his customers can be superwealthy , most are just " everyday " people for whom time is a real commodity , reports cnbc . " moms hire me because they ca n't wait in lines in the mornings . they have to take the kids off to school . " though in that wealthy vein , the times recounts the time a group from the middle east had nine sold workers wait in line for cronuts . whatever he 's doing , his advice : " the rule is always respect the order of things . first come first served . " ( this line stretched more than a mile last november . )
