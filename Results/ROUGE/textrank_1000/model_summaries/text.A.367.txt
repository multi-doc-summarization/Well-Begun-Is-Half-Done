thousands of enraged dairy farmers converged on the european parliament in brussels yesterday , and sprayed the building , and the cops who showed up to contain them , with their stock in trade : milk . the protesters arrived on tractors , blocked traffic along many of the city 's main streets , then pulled out hoses and let thousands of liters of the white stuff fly , reuters reports . they also set fire to a trailer full of hay , and hung a nondescript body in effigy . the farmers are demanding a 25 % bump in milk prices , which they say have become untenably low , the bbc reports ; in belgium , for instance , a liter sells for about $ 0.34 wholesale , but costs about $ 0.52 to produce . part of the problem : the eu sets an annual quota of about 143 tons of milk , more than europe can consume . " it 's very simple : you ca n't live off milk anymore , " one french farmer said . " if i go on , it 's thanks to european aid . "
