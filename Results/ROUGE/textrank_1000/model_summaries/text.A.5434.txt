imagine all the water in the arctic ocean . now , imagine all that and more on mars . if you visited the red planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago , that 's what you likely would have found , say nasa scientists . their new study arrived at that " solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space , " says lead author geronimo villanueva . the guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in mars ' atmosphere : h2o and hdo , in which deuterium ( aka " heavy " hydrogen ) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom . as national geographic explains , mars ' gravity is weaker than our own ; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time , boosting the amount of deuterium in its water . scientists compared the ratio of hdo to h2o in martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions , a press release states . they ultimately calculated that mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean . it could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep , but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely : that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet , was located in the northern hemisphere , and was as much as a mile deep . while national geographic observes the findings back up " reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface " of mars , another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new . " the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought , suggesting it might have been habitable for longer , " a scientist says .
