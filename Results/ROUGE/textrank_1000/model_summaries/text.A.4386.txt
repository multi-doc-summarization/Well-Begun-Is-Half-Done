mitochondrial diseases afflict an estimated one in 4,000 people , most notably in the recent high-profile case of charlie gard in the uk , whose parents unsuccessfully sought to transport him to the us for experimental treatment . the fault lies in mitochondrial dna , which is inherited from mothers and is responsible for powering every cell in the body , per quartz . now a 5-month-old baby in michigan has been diagnosed with mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 13 , which claimed the life of gard last week . his parents will attempt experimental treatment in boston , they tell newschannel3 . with only a 50 % chance of reaching his second birthday , they say at least their baby might " help other children with this condition . " russell cruzan iii , or " bubs , " first worried his parents in early june , when they wondered why he was n't eating or thriving and was lethargic . after several hospital visits , respiratory problems , and eventually pneumonia , they got the grim diagnosis : his body lacked the energy to power his major organs . the couple does n't have help from their insurance provider , per wood tv , so they 've set up a youcaring page to help with the initial test . this is the type of disease that geneticists hope to be able to stop in its tracks using so-called three-parent ivf , where a donor egg supplies a healthy set of mitochondrial dna ( 37 genes ) and the biological mother supplies her egg 's nucleus ( thousands of genes ) without passing on mitochondrial diseases . ( a baby was born in mexico using this technique . )
