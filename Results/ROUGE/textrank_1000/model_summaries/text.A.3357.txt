" tiger mom " amy chua is in the news again , though not because of her parenting . rather , she 's become ensnared in the latest coverage of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh and his interaction with women . the guardian reports that chua , a yale professor , " played an outsized role in vetting " the clerks who worked for kavanaugh , as many of them came from yale , kavanaugh 's alma mater . the unnamed sources the paper spoke with described receiving advice from chua and her husband , jed rubenfeld , also of yale , about the " look " kavanaugh favored . there are no allegations of improper behavior between kavanaugh and his clerks , but some found chua and rubenfeld 's " counsel off-putting , " per the huffpost 's source , who says the advice she received was " phrased as a warning . " the guardian reports the couple 's tendency to raise the issue of looks did n't extend to other judges . one student who was advised by the couple says , " i have no reason to believe [ kavanaugh ] was saying , 'send me the pretty ones , ' but rather that he was reporting back and saying , ' i really like so and so , ' and the way he described them led them to form certain conclusions . " those conclusions allegedly included chua telling students it was " no accident " the women who clerked for kavanaugh " looked like models , " and rubenfeld saying kavanaugh opted for female clerks " with a certain look . " chua , who is reportedly dealing with a serious illness , said in a statement that the only trait kavanaugh requires in his clerks is excellence . yale law school says it will look into the claims , which it says it had not previously heard .
