americans trying to save for retirement might be pleased to learn that a new law expected next year will require something that sounds obvious : all financial advisers will be required to work in their clients ' best interests . as vox explains , that is " amazingly " not the case now . two kinds of advisers currently exist : " registered investment advisers , " who tend to work with the wealthy , are held to high fiduciary standards akin to the standards of doctors and lawyers , and they must indeed work in the best interests of their clients . but the other group , " broker-dealers , " are more like salespeople who work on commissions . they 're required only to provide " suitable " advice , and there 's nothing stopping them from steering their middle-class clients into high-fee products that result in fat commissions for themselves . the obama administration has been trying to tighten the law—to ensure that all advisers put their clients ' interests above their own or their company's—and the spending bill that cleared congress last week all but ensures it will happen . the financial industry had mounted a " last-minute battle " to kill the provision , but it fell short , reports the wall street journal . as a result , the labor department is expected to draft the legislation in january ahead of its implementation later in the year . proponents say that it will save people big money in their iras and 401 ( k ) s , while the industry argues that it will drive many brokers out of business and thus put the price of getting investment advice out of reach for many . at bloomberg view , meanwhile , former broker and sec chief arthur levitt argues that the change is " long overdue .
