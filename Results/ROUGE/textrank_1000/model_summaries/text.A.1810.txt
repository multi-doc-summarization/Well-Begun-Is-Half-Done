men with low sex drive might try switching on a light , a new study shows . taking a cue from depression treatment , researchers at the university of siena in italy found that bright light stimulates testosterone levels and led to better results in the bedroom , reports the bbc . using a light box lined with fluorescent tubes , researchers tested the effects on 38 men diagnosed with low libidos . one half were exposed to bright lights , and the rest to lower doses of light . those who received the brighter lights for 30 minutes daily over two weeks tripled their rate of sexual satisfaction.the amount of testosterone in the control group did n't change , but the bright-light group saw their levels rise to 3.6 nanograms per milliliter from 2.1 . " the increased levels of testosterone explain the greater reported sexual satisfaction , " said lead author andrea fagiolini , per the independent . he said testosterone production among men in the northern hemisphere declines naturally from november through april ( peaking in october ) . " the use of the light box really mimics what nature does , " fagiolini said . he said light therapy " inhibits the pineal gland in the center of the brain and this may allow the production of more testosterone , and there are probably other hormonal effects . " light box therapy is commonly used to treat depression caused by seasonal affective disorder . although researchers cautioned that more research was needed , light therapy could be a promising hope for men whose sex drive is off , particularly during the winter months . a quarter of men over 40 report lagging libido and other problems , reports the independent . ( women with low libido should check their heart rate . )
