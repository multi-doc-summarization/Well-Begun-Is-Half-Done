there 's no doubt about it : the human body goes through major changes in youth and old age . and these biological and social changes may be the reasons behind what researchers are calling less stable personalities at those life stages . in fact , according to a study of almost 4,000 new zealanders between the ages of 20 and 80 , the stability of one 's personality increases through youth and into middle age and peaks in our 50s , before we slide back into less stable versions of ourselves , reports research digest . as the smithsonian puts it , " in some ways , our 80-year-old selves mirror our 20-year-old selves . " some traits peaked at different times ; the most stable traits in one 's 30s are extraversion and neuroticism , while in the late 40s and early 50s it is openness , honesty-humility , and conscientiousness . the only trait that showed " gradually reduced stability " throughout life was agreeableness ; apparently we are simply less and less agreeable as we pack the years on . still , one 's most basic personality—introvert vs. extrovert , for example—tends to remain consistent throughout one 's life , even if the stability of traits waxes and wanes , notes the smithsonian . ( other researchers have even calculated the country 's most extroverted city . )
