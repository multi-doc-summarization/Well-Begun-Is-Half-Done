vladimir putin 's annual speech to lawmakers thursday contained what appears to be a jarring threat to the us and the rest of the world : russia has a new , " invincible " missile that can go anywhere and can not be stopped , he said . a video graphic behind putin showed a missile taking off from russia , zooming across the atlantic to south america , then turning north toward the us , reports the washington post . " i hope everything that has been said today will sober any potential aggressor , " putin said , without naming names . he added that russia had developed the nuclear-capable weapon , which " missile defenses will be useless against , " despite skepticism about moscow 's abilities . " nobody listened to us , " he said , per nbc news . " well listen to us now . " putin , who asserted that moscow has " no plans to be an aggressor , " also said russia had a new underwater drone capable of carrying a nuclear warhead , reports the ap . and he declared that any use of nuclear weapons against one of its allies—again , he did not mention specific nations—would be considered a nuclear attack on russia and that moscow would respond in kind . all in all , the two-hour speech suggested " a new arms race " between russia and the west , observes the guardian . the speech comes less than three weeks before putin is expected to easily win another six-year term , reports the bbc . he used much of the address to focus on economic reforms , promising among other things to reduce the rate of poverty by half in the next six years .
