on june 5 , swiss voters will weigh in on a measure that 's never been implemented in any country : make sure every citizen and legal resident gets $ 2,600 , every month , tax-free ( $ 650 for kids ) â€”no matter what their employment situation or income level , usa today reports . what gawker says is perceived as the " utopian idea " of an unconditional basic income has been bandied about by individual cities in countries such as the netherlands and canada , but switzerland would be the first nation to go for it . a group of swiss intelligentsia was able to cull the 100,000 signatures required under the swiss system to get it on the ballot . " it would lead to a more motivated workforce and [ a ] more humanized , stable , and productive economy , " the initiative 's co-founder says . the estimated $ 200 billion-a-year plan would be funded in part by raising the country 's value-added tax ( currently at 8 % ) , its supporters say . critics , however , say other taxes would have to rise , too , and fear the plan would sap people 's motivation to work . someone with no income would reap the full $ 2,600 a month tax-free , while others making some money would have their income supplemented to reach that cap ( so if you already make $ 1,000 , the government would fork over $ 1,600 ) . and if you already bring in more than that $ 2,600 limit ? that amount of your monthly income would n't be taxed . usa today spells out what that would mean for two parents who did n't work with two kids at home : a combined family income , tax-free , of $ 78,000 a year . it does n't appear likely the vote will go the initiative 's way .
