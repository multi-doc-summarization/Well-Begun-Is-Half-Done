a freshman republican in the house now has much bigger worries than a re-election campaign . rep. trey radel , who represents florida 's fort myers area , has been charged with misdemeanor cocaine possession in dc , reports politico . the miami herald describes radel as a " libertarian-leaning " republican in line with the tea party and says the 37-year-old might have caught a break by getting busted in washington : he would have faced felony charges in florida . his maximum penalty in dc would be 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine if convicted . â€œ i 'm profoundly sorry to let down my family , particularly my wife and son , and the people of southwest florida , " radel says in a statement picked up by the naples daily news . " i struggle with the disease of alcoholism , and this led to an extremely irresponsible choice . as the father of a young son and a husband to a loving wife , i need to get help so i can be a better man for both of them . " radel , a self-described rap fan and " hip hop conservative , " once co-sponsored a bill to ease up on mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses , notes the herald .
