starbucks ' irish twitter account has just 2,000 followers , but an awkward tweet it directed to them has managed to piss off an entire nation : " show us what makes you proud to be british , " the company tweeted during the diamond jubilee . the coffee giant says it intended the message to reach only its uk twitter followers , the guardian reports . one irish customer warned @ starbucksie : " the ie stands for ireland , awaiting the apology before i visit your stores again ! ! " following the mistake , starbucks ' ireland account noted that " we erroneously posted to our irish twitter page meaning to post to the uk only . customers in ireland : we 're sorry . "
