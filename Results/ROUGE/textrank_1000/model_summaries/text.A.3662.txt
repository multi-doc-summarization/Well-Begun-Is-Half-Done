outer space may be soundless , but it 's apparently not odorless . life 's little mysteries recently stumbled upon a 2009 interview with a nasa astronaut that 's too good to not resurrect . in it , kevin ford spoke of picking up the weird odor while undertaking spacewalks . it 's not something he could smell while embarking on them ( the plastic odor of the spacesuit delights the nose then ) , but once back in the international space station , the smell is there : a metallic odor that life 's little mysteries describes as having the " aroma of seared steak , hot metal , and welding fumes . "
