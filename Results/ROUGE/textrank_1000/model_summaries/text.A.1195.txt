bowe bergdahl will be back in the us late tonight . both ap and cnn quote defense officials as saying he will be transferred overnight from a military base in germany to the brooke army medical center in san antonio . the reports offer no more details on bergdahl 's recuperation after being held five years by the taliban . the issue of his return came up publicly yesterday when defense chief chuck hagel testified before congress , and republican jeff miller pressed him on why bergdahl was still in germany , notes the idaho statesman . “ why hasn ’ t he been returned to the united states ? " asked miller , who seemed to be suggesting that the pentagon was keeping bergdahl overseas to shield him from questions . " we have seriously wounded soldiers that have returned to the united states almost immediately after they are stabilized . ... you ’ re trying to tell me that he ’ s being held in landstuhl , germany because of his medical condition ? ” hagel : “ congressman , i hope you ’ re not implying anything other than that . the fact— miller : " i 'm just asking the question . " hagel : “ i ’ m gon na give you an answer too . i don ’ t like the implication of the question . he ’ s being held there because our medical professionals don ’ t believe he ’ s ready ... to take the next step to rehabilitation . ”
