nasa will be studying how scott kelly 's body reacted to almost a year in space , using his twin brother mark kelly , who stayed on earth , as a control . one big difference to note right away : the brothers will no longer be the same height , as they were before scott went into space , because he grew 2 inches while aboard the international space station , cnn reports . " astronauts get taller in space as the spine elongates , " nasa 's jeff williams explains . that 's because " without the full strength of gravity pressing down on gel-filled discs between the vertebrae , they expand and lengthen the spine , " the washington post explains . but scott wo n't be able to lord it over mark for too long : astronauts " return to preflight height after a short time back on earth , " williams says .
