a former cop who paid underage girls for sex is facing a harsher sentence over his brand of condom , the chicago tribune reports . william whitley , 61 , pleaded guilty this week in federal court to sex trafficking of a minor and will likely serve 10 years to life . prosecutors leveled federal charges partly because his condoms—lifestyles and trojan magnums—were manufactured outside of illinois , meaning he engaged in interstate commerce , the kansas city star reports . his use of a cellphone to snap sexually explicit photos of two girls and paying them with money also hit the " federal nexus , " prosecutors say . the condom brands were included in the fbi 's criminal complaint the way guns often are . " the gun traveling is analogous to the condom traveling , " says a law professor and former federal prosecutor . " the person who pulled the trigger may not have traveled , but the gun did . this police officer may not have traveled , but an aspect that he used to commit the crime did . " whitley claimed he did n't know one of the girls was 14 when they had sex over a four-month period in 2015 , but investigators suggested that her braces could have tipped him off . he met the other girl , a 16-year-old runaway , at a party where runaways prostituted themselves to older men . she says she gave him oral sex five times for $ 60 to $ 65 each . the chicago sun-times reports that whitley , a 20-year veteran of the chicago pd , will be sentenced in september .
