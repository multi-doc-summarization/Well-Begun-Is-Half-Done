the former director of national intelligence minced no words sunday in describing " our institutions " as being " under assault , both externallyâ€”and that 's the big news here , is the russian interference in our election system , " clapper told cnn in addressing james comey 's firing as he investigated that interference . " i think as well our institutions are under assault internally . " asked , " internally , from the president ? " clapper said , " exactly . " he continued : " the founding fathers , in their genius , created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances . i feel as though that is under assault and is eroding . " there was lots more comey reaction on the sunday dial , via the ap : chuck schumer : wants a new fbi director " not of partisan background " with " great experience " and " courage . " he also said democrats should refuse to confirm a new director until a special investigator into russian meddling had been appointed , per cnn . lindsey graham : " it 's now time to pick somebody ( to run the fbi ) who comes from within the ranks , or is of such a reputation who has no political background at all who can go into the job from day 1 . " mark warner : " i think jim comey deserves his chance to lay out to the american public his side of the facts , " warner said , per the hill . " we would love to have director comey appear in an open hearing . " further , " how he was treated was pretty awful by this president . "
