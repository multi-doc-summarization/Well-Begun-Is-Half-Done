looks like a teenager 's online petition has induced coca-cola to remove an ingredient from powerade . the mississippi teen , sarah kavanagh , led the charge with two change.org petitions against brominated vegetable oil—one targeting powerade , the other gatorade—that gathered nearly 260,000 supporters in all , the ap reports . pepsico agreed to pull bvo from gatorade last year , and now powerade bottles in strawberry lemonade and fruit punch flavors in several cities do n't have the ingredient listed . some bottles still list it , and coca-cola said today that powerade is " bvo-free , " so it seems the company is phasing it out . just what is bvo ? according to the fda , it 's used in fruit-flavored drinks as a stabilizer for flavoring oils . but bromine is a patented flame retardant that 's banned in the european union and japan , and may be harmful to anyone who drinks it in large amounts , the telegram reports . coca-cola and pepsico are n't the only companies under pressure from petitions : subway yanked an fda-approved ingredient known as the " yoga mat chemical " from its breads earlier this year when a petitioner at foodbabe.com challenged the company 's healthy-food image .
