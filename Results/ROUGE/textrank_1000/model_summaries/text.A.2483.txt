the atm is getting a lesson in self-defense—from a bug . researchers in switzerland were inspired by the bombardier beetle , which shoots out a gas that can burn skin , the atlantic reports . the beetle 's mechanism works by mixing two chemicals normally kept separate in its abdomen . when under attack , the beetle combines the hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone to spray its attack gas . the researchers copied this system by putting hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide side-by-side , separated by only a lacquer . break that lacquer , and you get the reaction . atm makers could employ the principle in their machines by rigging them to ooze foam if someone begins tampering , say the researchers . instead of burning acid , the atms could cover bills with dye and dna , making the cash hard to use and easy to track . " thieves may be able to run , " notes gizmodo , but " it 's getting much harder for them to hide . " in fact , the mechanism " could be used anywhere you find things that should n't be touched , " a researcher tells eth zurich—whether to fight vandalism or keep animals off crops .
