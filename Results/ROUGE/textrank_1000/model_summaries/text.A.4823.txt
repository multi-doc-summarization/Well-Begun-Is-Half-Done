after the pilot of a small plane fell ill at the controls , two flight instructors were called in to the airport to give his only passenger a crash course in not crashing . the passenger—who had no flying experience—managed to bring the plane in for a safe , though somewhat bumpy , landing at england 's humberside airport . " he made quite a good landing actually , " one of the flight instructors tells the bbc . " he did n't know the layout of the airplane , he did n't have lights on so he was absolutely flying blind as well , " he says . " i think he 'd flown once before as a passenger but never flown an airplane before . " there were cheers in the control room as the passenger made a successful landing on his fourth attempt , says the instructor , who did his best to keep the man calm . " i think without any sort of talk-down he would have just gone into the ground and that would have been the end of it , " he says . a pilot who witnessed the landing praised the " most amazing brave passenger who landed at humberside at night with a blacked out cockpit and cross wind , " the lincolnshire echo reports . " the boy done well , never landed a plane before and sounded calm as a cucumber on the radio , " he said . sadly , the bbc reports that the pilot died ; the cause of death has not been given . ( in another recent emergency landing , a plane was forced to come down ... on a california highway . )
