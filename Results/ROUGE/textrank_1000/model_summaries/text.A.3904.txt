nicole kidman continues her recent trend of dishing about her marriage to tom cruise in a new cover interview with vanity fair . " i was so young , " she says of marrying cruise at age 23 . " i was a child , really , when i got married . " that 's why she was alone for some time after her divorce . " i needed to grow up , " she says , and she also " did n't want to jump from one relationship to another . " as for what it was like to be in a relationship with such a high-profile person , well , there 's one other couple that likely understands , kidman says . " there is something about that sort of existence that , if you really focus on each other and you ’ re in that bubble , it ’ s very intoxicating , because it ’ s just the two of you , " she explains . " and there is only one other person that ’ s going through it . so it brings you very close , and it ’ s deeply romantic . i ’ m sure brad and angelina have that—because there ’ s nobody else that understands it except that person who ’ s sleeping right next to you . " but she would n't call cruise her " great love " —that 's current husband keith urban , she says , adding , " no disrespect to what i had with tom . " as for urban , e ! reports that he yesterday admitted to ellen degeneres that he and kidman engage in " nice sex texting " maybe once " a year . " also : " i 'm a little red right now . "
