" we hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto , " a study co-author says . " but there 's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity . " the study published in british medical journal the lancet found that the middle east and north africa had seen the biggest weight gains , though the us still has the largest number of obese people , with 87 million of the world 's 671 million obese people , reports reuters . other countries , however , have even higher obesity rates , including tonga , where more than 50 % of all adults are obese .
