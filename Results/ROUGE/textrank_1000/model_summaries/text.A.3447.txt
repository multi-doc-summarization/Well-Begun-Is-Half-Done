two years ago when someone stole an infamous iron gate from the former nazi concentration camp at dachau , angela merkel called the theft " appalling " and the director of the dachau memorial said it was a " deliberate , reprehensible attempt to deny and obliterate the memory of the crimes . " on friday , police announced the gate bearing the nazi propaganda slogan " arbeit macht frei " — " work sets you free " —has likely been found in bergen , norway , following an anonymous tip , the bbc reports . according to cnn , police have n't given any information about the tipper or where specifically the gate was found . no arrests have been made , reuters reports . police say the gate , which appears to be in ok condition , will be returned to germany " as soon as practical . " the nazis opened the dachau camp in 1933 , and by the time it was liberated by us soldiers in 1945 , more than 41,000 people—most of them jews—had been killed there , the guardian reports . the 220-pound iron gate was made by inmates at the camp , and its slogan was an attempt by the nazis to pass off the concentration camp as a " work and re-education camp . " the dachau camp is currently a memorial , and german authorities installed a replica gate there last year . a $ 10,000 reward had been offered for the return of the original gate . a sign with the same " arbeit macht frei " phrase on it was stolen from auschwitz in 2009 by a swedish neo-nazi , who spent more than two years in jail . ( a holocaust-themed skating number did n't go over well . )
