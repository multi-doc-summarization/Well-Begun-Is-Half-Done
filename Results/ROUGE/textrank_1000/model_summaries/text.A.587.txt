after rigging emissions tests to fool regulators , volkswagen appears to have belatedly decided that honesty is the best policy . michael horn , the chief of the german automaker 's us business , told an audience at an event in new york last night that the company had cheated , the bbc reports . " our company was dishonest with the epa , and the california air resources board and with all of you , and in my german words : we have totally screwed up , " he said , promising that the company would " make this right " and " will pay what we have to pay . " the company will face around $ 18 billion in fines in the us alone , and countries such as south korea are now also investigating emissions from volkswagen 's diesel vehicles , the ap reports . volkswagen may be punished with more than fines : sources tell bloomberg that the justice department—which recently launched a push to go after individuals as well as corporations in cases of corporate wrongdoing—is considering criminal proceedings , which could involve executives in both germany and the us . the scandal has already wiped more than $ 16 billion off volkswagen 's share price and the fallout could just be beginning . experts tell the guardian that the use of software to cheat emissions tests could be widespread in other countries and with other manufacturers . ( some 500,000 diesel volkswagen vehicles in the us have been recalled , and consumer reports has yanked its favorable ratings . )
