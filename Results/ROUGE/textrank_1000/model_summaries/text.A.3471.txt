critics agree that daybreakers is visually inventive , but the b-movie charms of this vampire/oil allegory do n't snare everyone . some opinions : willem dafoe " and his southern drawl goose things up , " joe neumaier writes for the new york daily news , and ethan hawke " has a greasy romanticism . " but directors the spierig brothers " seem to lose interest in what they 've created , a feeling that 's infectious . " the film " bursts with clever ideas and resonant concepts , " keith phipps writes at the onion av club . but the " plot digs into a rut , " and the " cleverly constructed , uncomfortably familiar world makes a deeper impression than much of what happens within it . " " after all the toothless , limp-dick vampire posturing in the twilight chick flicks , it 's a kick to see a balls-out , r-rated movie about bloodsuckers that does n't spare the gore so little girls wo n't cry into their twitpics of rob pattinson , " peter travers writes in rolling stone . yeah , it 's a b movie . " i 'll take that over pompous any day . " the " thin metaphor for our situation with oil " has " promising elements of a socio-satirical horror movie , " owen gleiberman writes in entertainment weekly . but it devolves into a " ponderous apocalyptic chase film , " like " children of men with exploding-plasma shock effects .
