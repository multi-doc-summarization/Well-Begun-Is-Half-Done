it was one small model for neil armstrong , but one giant heist for thieves : police in ohio are searching for a rare solid gold replica of the first vehicle to land on the moon that was stolen from the armstrong air and space museum late friday , npr reports . an alarm signaled cops to the theft from the museum in wapakoneta , armstrong 's hometown . police said it was impossible to put a value on the 5-inch cartier-cast replica , which armstrong received in paris shortly after the 1969 mission . fellow apollo 11 astronauts buzz aldrin and michael collins also got 18-karat models , which were commissioned and paid for by france 's le figaro newspaper and its readers . the museum , which closed for several hours on saturday , posted a statement on facebook saying , " the truth is that you ca n't steal from a museum . museum 's do n't 'own ' artifacts . we are simply vessels of the public trust . â€¦ for every day that an item is missing , we are all robbed of an opportunity to enjoy it and our history . " the fbi was aiding local police in investigating the theft . a retired nasa agent tells the ap the replica could fetch millions among space collectors , but the thieves probably plan to melt it down for its gold . joseph gutheinz jr. notes that whoever swiped the statue left behind a large moon rock also worth millions . " either they did n't have easy access to the moon rock , or they were n't into collectibles , " gutheinz says . " they were into turning a quick buck . " ( thanks to a nasa inventory error , this woman is $ 1.8 million richer . )
