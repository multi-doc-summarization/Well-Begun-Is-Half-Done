a man found himself in the middle of an unexpected science experiment in sweden after he set his bowl of grapes in the sun . richard walter says he was outside near his blanda blank stainless steel serving bowl from ikea when he noticed his grapes were on fire . " 'how is that possible ? ' i thought . then i saw there was one intense point where [ the sun ] hit the twigs , and that 's where it started . " his friends wanted proof , so walter posted a video on facebook of a piece of paper starting to burn after he placed it in the bowl in direct sunlight . for its part , ikea tells the swedish tabloid aftonbladet that it 's taking the information " very seriously " and investigating how this could happen . but a statement to the local suggests that the fiery mishap is indeed possible , with an ikea rep saying " it has been established that many different parameters would have to converge " for fire to occur , and the risk is " very low . the round design of the bowl further contributes to a very low risk of spreading , in case of any overheated material in the bowl . " business insider notes that no one has made any fire-related complaints on the us product page , where the bowl is described as a " great size for serving or prep cooking . " ( ikea is also doing its best to preserve marital bliss . )
