how do you mend a broken heart ? stem cells . or at least that 's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys , live science reports . the healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily . the procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage , the guardian reports . heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the us . scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient 's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells , which are less likely to be rejected since they do n't come from a donor . in the latest study in the journal nature , the team at shinshu university induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match . to avoid rejection , they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients ' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs . after studying the macaques for three months , researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells , which replaced about 16 % of the damaged heart tissue . in the end , the monkeys ' heart muscles contracted better , pumping blood more efficiently . human trials are not coming anytime soon , though , after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats . still , doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks . " currently , the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation , but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand , " heart researcher sam boateng told the guardian . ( monkeys on a strict low-calorie diet lived much longer . )
