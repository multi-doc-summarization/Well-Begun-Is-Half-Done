the tesla model x that slammed into a highway barrier in california last week and killed the 38-year-old apple engineer at the wheel had been on autopilot at the time of the crash , tesla confirms in a blog post . but the company says driver walter huang " received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive , " adding that " the driver â€™ s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision . " tesla also laid some blame on state highway officials , asserting that " the reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator , a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider , had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced . " the fact that the vehicle was on autopilot is likely to be controversial because , as abc news notes , driver huang had reportedly been concerned about it . his brother told kgo that huang had brought his model x back to the dealership complaining that when he used the feature , the car kept swerving toward the very same barrier that it eventually struck in the fatal collision . the ntsb is investigating the crash , including the fire that broke out after the collision . the accident follows another in arizona in which a self-driving uber struck and killed a pedestrian .
