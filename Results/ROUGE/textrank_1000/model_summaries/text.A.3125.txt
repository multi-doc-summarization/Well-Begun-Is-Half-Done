a team of international scientists is going to spend $ 10 million to try to breed a herd of all-star cowsâ€”ones that do n't burp a lot . the idea is to cut down on the cows ' methane emissions , which would have a two-fold benefit , explains the verge : it would help the environment by reducing a potent greenhouse gas , and it would help farmers by making the cows more efficient and thus reducing feed costs . the scientists have found that some cows simply belch less than their peers , even when fed the same diet . they 're going to start with 25 of these well-mannered dairy cows and expand the herd to 1,400 through selective breeding , reports the university of aberdeen , which is leading the project . as for the environmental benefits of reducing cow emissions : " it 's silly , but it 's also a big problem , " notes grist . some farmers have experimented with special diets , but that gets expensive and ends up reducing beneficial nutrients from the cow along with the methane .
