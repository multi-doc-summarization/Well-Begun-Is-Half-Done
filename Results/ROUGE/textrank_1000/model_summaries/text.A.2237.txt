three female ukrainian activists drove into crimea just before its referendum and ended up kidnapped , beaten , and tossed in the same jail , they tell the daily beast . they were driving into crimea—one on her own , and two together—to spread their views when cossacks , russian militia , and ukrainian " berkut " riot police dragged them onto a road near armyansk . " i could not believe that berkut was beating us , humiliating us , cutting our hair off and threatening to kill us in broad daylight , " said kateryna butko , 25 . it was bad for their male friends , too , who were stripped down to their underwear and had guns fired beside their heads . all were taken to a russian navy base in sevastopol , where russian military questioned them about their activities . " i was having long political discussions with my polite interrogators , " said butko . the russians even let her go out with russian journalists , hoping she would speak well of russia later , but the trio seemed unconvinced after being freed : " i would not advise any activists to go to crimea these days , " said one . makes sense , considering that crimea has seen more than 20 kidnappings lately , the guardian reports , and kyivpost says kidnappings and assaults of ukrainian activists and journalists " have become the norm " since russia invaded .
