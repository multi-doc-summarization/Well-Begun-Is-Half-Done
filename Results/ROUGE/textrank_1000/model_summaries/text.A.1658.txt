a blustery day on a virginia bridge led to a truck driver 's death thursday , the ap reports . joseph chen , a 47-year-old employee of evans transport , was crossing the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in his tractor-trailer around 12:30pm , shortly after weather reports had indicated a level 1 wind advisory , meaning winds were clocking in at over 40mph , the virginian-pilot reports . the north carolina man was driving his truck southbound when his vehicle went over the side and into the 45-degree chesapeake bay . as his truck began to sink , chen was spotted standing atop it , offering hope he 'd survive the freak accident . but after a navy chopper pulled him from the water , he died en route to the hospital . just 30 minutes after chen 's truck was swept off the bridge , the wind advisory was raised to a level 2 , which means winds had crept up past 47mph . between 1964 and 2011 , 10 vehicles driving over that bridge have met similar fates , with only one survivor out of the bunch , per virginian-pilot records . a truck driver who crosses the bridge a couple of times a week tells wavy " on a windy day , you can feel it " and that his truck will sway from left to right , depending on the wind 's direction . meanwhile , chen 's wife , billie jo , tells the virginian-pilot her husband " was off the chain . " they would 've marked their 10-year anniversary in april . she added her husband , whom she said was " awesome , " had two kids from a previous marriage . ( a truck fell from the sky in san diego . )
