for 71 years , " we did n't even know about her . i 'm getting tears now just thinking about it , " says thelma janes of canada , days after discovering she has a belgian sister . janes ' father , herbert louis hellyer , married and had five children in british columbia before heading off to war in 1939 , reports cbc news . he returned from belgium after six years , having suffered a serious brain injury , and committed suicide in 1948 . unbeknownst to any of his children in canada , hellyer also left behind their half-sister overseas , the result of an affair he had while stationed in ghent . belgium 's florence heene , 71 , who knew only that her father was a canadian soldier named herbert , found his photo in a box of her mother 's things and shared it on facebook recently in an effort to find out more about him . hellyer 's great-granddaughter saw the photo circulating in the media in canada—a blogger at the toronto sun was among those on the case—and thought it looked familiar . in a box of her own mother 's items , she found an identical picture hellyer had sent home during the war , signed , " love from daddy . " " i 'm an elderly woman , i know what went on in the war and it 's to be expected , " janes , 79 , says of her father 's affair . but the discovery of a half-sister left her in " absolute shock , " she says . several family members have since reached out to heene to share their father 's story and to welcome her to the family . heene , for her part , tells the cbc that " i have the piece [ of my life ] that i was looking for , " she says .
