the study on the austrian find calls it a " sunken ship of the desert " and an " exotic animal . " what exactly was found in a cellar containing centuries-old trash during excavations for a planned shopping center in tulln : the full skeleton of a 17th-century camel . that a complete skeleton was found is unique , but the presence of camel bones is less so : the ottoman army used the creatures for transportation and , in some cases , food , and their bones have been found in the region . but the completeness of the skeleton shows " the animal was not killed and then butchered , " says archaeozoologist and study author alfred galik in a press release . he suggests it may have been traded or left behind by the troops , possibly following their siege of vienna in 1683 , reports the bbc . the locals " did not exploit this alien animal " for food upon its death , as the ottoman troops " certainly would have done , " write the authors in the study , published in plos one . " exploitation of camel flesh especially in times of need was absolutely necessary , " and the regularity with which that happened is " a reason for the scarce preservation of camel finds in general . " what researchers were able to glean from this find : the male camel was the hybrid offspring of a female dromedary and male bactrian camel and probably castrated , which would have made him easier to handle . crossbreeding , which was not unusual for the time , made for larger animals that " were especially suited for military use , " galik explains . to wit , the study points to bone defects that indicate the animal was harnessed and ridden , reports the bbc . ( oil workers recently made a big find in siberia . )
