a psychedelic brew from the jungles of brazil shows promise as a treatment for depression—in fact , as a treatment for those who do n't respond to more traditional medication . researchers at the university of sao paulo have just published the results of the first clinical trial involving the anti-depressant effects of ayahuasca , a centuries-old drink made from jungle vine and shrubs long used in religious ceremonies in south america , reports scientific american . patients began to feel better within a couple of hours—conventional medications can take weeks to kick in—and the beneficial effects lasted for three weeks . the " psychedelic " part wore off after about five hours . " this is an area that really does merit further work and serious consideration , " a psychiatrist at the university of california , san francisco , not involved with the study tells the huffington post . " there 's a need for effective treatments that can work in the short term . " like conventional anti-depressant medications , the chemical compounds in ayahuasca seem to alter the brain 's level of serotonin , a neurotransmitter that regulates mood . popular science highlights one " grain of salt " aspect of the study : it was small , with just six participants , and it did not have a placebo group . but more studies are under way , and a much larger one at at the federal university of rio grande do norte should wrap up this year . ( another study finds that talk therapy is effective at preventing suicides . )
