here 's an unfortunate hypothetical : an earthquake strikes along the san andreas fault , damaging three aqueducts that cross it some 32 times . those aqueducts supply los angeles with all but 12 % of its water—meaning a serious quake could ultimately leave 22 million people without water . ( there would be about six month 's worth of water stored on the la side of the fault , but fixing busted aqueducts could take more than twice that long . ) officials have been aware of the potential for a single quake to hit all three aqueducts since 2008 , but as the los angeles times reports , they 're now moving to do something about it for the first time . but any solution is pretty far off , in terms of time and money—in terms of the latter , the lat uses the word " billions . " none of the aqueducts has yet had to deal with the scenario ; the last huge quake ( magnitude 7.9 ) along the fault was in 1857 . the los angeles aqueduct travels across the fault under a mountain , by way of the five-mile-long concrete elizabeth tunnel . building a brand new tunnel is the priciest option ; sending water over the mountains via an electric pumping mechanism is another idea . in the case of the colorado river aqueduct , a quake could raise a section of the pipe by 13 feet , and there are n't any pumps in place to ferry the water to la . the mayor last week requested that proposals on the issue be submitted by july . meanwhile , the san diego union-tribune reports that there may be another fault to fear : it points to new research that shows the san jacinto fault could generate an earthquake as powerful as what the san andreas fault is capable of .
