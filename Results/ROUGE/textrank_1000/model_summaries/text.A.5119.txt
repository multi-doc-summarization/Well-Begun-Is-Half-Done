the telegraph reported yesterday on a crazy court case in the uk : after a pregnant italian woman , in town for business , had a panic attack , social service workers in essex got a court order allowing the woman to be forcibly sedated and undergo a c-section so they could take her baby . fifteen months later , the little girl is still with social service workers , who wo n't return her to her mother . the case is now " an international legal row , " the telegraph says , and the anonymous woman 's lawyers call it " unprecedented . " the woman was in britain in july 2012 for an airline training course , and called police when she suffered the panic attack . they arrived while she was on the phone with her mother , who told police the woman suffered from bipolar disorder and was off her medication , according to a telegraph columnist . police took her to a psychiatric facility , and restrained her under the mental health act when she said she wanted to go back to her hotel . she underwent the c-section after having been there five weeks . the case is ongoing ; the mother says she has made a full recovery , but a judge nonetheless ruled that her daughter should be put up for adoption . more on the case here and here .
