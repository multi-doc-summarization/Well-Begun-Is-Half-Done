looks like david oliver relin 's grief over three cups of tea may have led to his suicide . relin , who co-authored the book , was suffering from depression and experienced financial and emotional strain over allegations that the book contained lies , the christian science monitor reports . relin did n't deny the accusations publicly , but did hire a lawyer to defend against a lawsuit that claimed relin and co-author greg mortenson had defrauded readers . a judge threw out the lawsuit last year . but relin and mortenson always had a strained relationship , and relin never thought mortenson deserved co-author credit , reports the new york times . last year , reports emerged that the authors had fabricated elements of the book , like an opening anecdote about mortenson being rescued by villagers in pakistan . despite all this , npr reports that relin has a new book coming out next year : second suns , two doctors and their amazing quest to restore sight and save lives , about doctors who perform cataract surgery in third world countries .
