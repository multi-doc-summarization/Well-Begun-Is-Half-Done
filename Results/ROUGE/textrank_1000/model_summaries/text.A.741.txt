a texas newspaper just did something it has n't done since before world war ii : recommended a democrat for president , the los angeles times reports , noting the lone star state is a " must-win " for donald trump . in a wednesday editorial , the dallas morning news says it had no choice but to throw its support behind hillary clinton , calling her the only " serious candidate " on the ballot . " if you 're counting , that 's more than 75 years and nearly 20 elections , " the paper notes about the end of its streak ( it endorsed fdr in 1940 , per vox ) . the paper adds it still has beefs with the democratic party and a wariness regarding clinton , but that its endorsement comes because " unlike donald trump , hillary clinton has experience in actual governance , a record of service , and a willingness to delve into real policy . " the paper cites how clinton reached across the aisle in the senate and wielded her authority as secretary of state to make " tough calls " about the middle east and in the " complex struggle against radical islamic terrorism . " the paper acknowledges clinton is still dealing with controversy regarding her emails , the clinton foundation , and a general perception by many that she 's not honest and trustworthy . but it says those who are lobbing charges of " treason " and " murder " are just " political hyenas " bent on seeing nothing but " conspiracies and cover-ups " and that her mistakes " are plainly in a different universe than [ trump 's ] . " meanwhile , the gop nominee is labeled as unprepared , lacking in judgment and impulse control ( as evidenced by his often-ranting " midnight tweets " ) , and someone who " [ exploits ] base instincts of xenophobia , racism , and misogyny . " clinton " has spent years in the trenches doing the hard work needed to prepare herself to lead our nation . in this race , at this time , she deserves your vote . " ( trump 's latest endorsement came from 88 retired military officials . )
