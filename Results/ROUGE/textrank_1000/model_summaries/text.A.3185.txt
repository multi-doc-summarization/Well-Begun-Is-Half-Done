swatting a fruit fly is as tricky as trying to catch a tiny fighter jet with an expert pilot at the controls , researchers say . high-speed cameras captured the insects avoiding threats by executing supercharged , banked turns much like fighter planes , reports the los angeles times . the flies beat their wings 200 times per second and were capable of altering course in a single wingbeat , performing complex calculations incredibly quickly for a creature with only a tiny speck of a brain . the university of washington team plans further research to determine how the flies are able to perform such amazing feats in the air , reports the seattle post-intelligencer . " a fly with a brain the size of a salt grain has the behavioral repertoire nearly as complex as a much larger animal such as a mouse , " one of the researchers says . " that â€™ s a super interesting problem from an engineering perspective . "
