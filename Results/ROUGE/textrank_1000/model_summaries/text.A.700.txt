michael bay 's latest movie is a bit of a shift from transformers—it 's a smaller-budget film based on a true story about bodybuilders who get involved in kidnapping . critics offer mixed reviews : at salon , andrew o'hehir calls pain & gain " a thoroughly reprehensible and frequently hilarious satire that depicts american life as a circus of stupidity , artificiality , and self-regard . " bay , he notes , " sends a clear message to those of us who 've been making fun of him : he 's been in on the joke the whole time . " " compared with armageddon or the transformers series , " this is " a stripped-down , modest enterprise in which no major american city is reduced to rubble , " notes ao scott in the new york times . it " leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity . " but " why choose ? " " the combination of the words 'michael bay ' and 'steroids ' should be enough to give any moviegoer pause , " observes liam lacey in the globe and mail . the film " plays like goodfellas as performed by the three stooges . as a genre-mashing exercise it ’ s almost interesting , but , really , why bother ?

" but its biggest lift comes from the pumped-up ( mark ) wahlberg and ( dwayne ) johnson . they manage to find the humanity in all the adrenalized muscle . "
