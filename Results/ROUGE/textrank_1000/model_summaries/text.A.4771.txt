another twist in the francisco sanchez case : the gun that the murder suspect claims he found wrapped in a t-shirt on a bench belonged to a federal agent and was stolen in a recent car break-in , sources tell the san francisco chronicle . the sources say the firearm was n't the agent 's official gun , and abc news reports that the bureau of land management is investigating whether the gun belonged to one of its employees . sanchez , who claims the gun went off accidentally when he picked it up , killing 32-year-old kathryn steinle , pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder yesterday , the ap reports . sanchez has been deported from the us five times , and san francisco 's decision not to turn him over to federal authorities for deportation when a drug charge was dropped in april has been strongly criticized by lawmakers and presidential candidates , including hillary clinton , who told cnn yesterday that the " city made a mistake , not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported . " at yesterday 's hearing , sanchez 's public defender said the shooting appeared accidental and argued that the media should look at the " ubiquitous nature of guns in our society " instead of the immigration issue , the chronicle reports .
