a french town is being terrorized by a serial killer—but humans are n't the target . the telegraph reports that someone in the village of minihy-treguier has so far slaughtered more than 100 rabbits , slipping into residents ' yards , yanking rabbits out of their hutches , and either stomping them to death by foot or murdering them with a sharp tool of some kind . " the cages are opened , then the animals are killed in cold blood and left at the scene , " a police statement notes , per the sunday times . the town 's mayor says there 've been 15 attacks in all , starting in march , with some homes getting hit more than once . " he returned to one home four times , killing 20 rabbits there in all , " the mayor notes . one woman who lost six adult rabbits—as well as some of their babies , which died after the mothers were killed—tells local media she once surprised a man she though was the rabbit murderer , wearing a black hat and a long raincoat , one morning , " but he had the time to make his escape . " oddly left alone in these murderous rampages : chickens and geese that often cohabitate with the bunnies . ( authorities do n't think foxes or other animals are killing the rabbits , as was the case with a slew of mysterious cat deaths in the uk . )
