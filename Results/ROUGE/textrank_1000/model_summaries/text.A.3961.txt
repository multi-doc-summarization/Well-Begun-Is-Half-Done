" sam rubin , ktla-tv : " this is another rare example where the quality of the movie does indeed exceed the hype . " he predicts oscar nominations for best picture and best director . the sneak , the sun : " everything feels real—and it ’ s as if you are immersed in the action . ... the sneak ’ s advice is to make sure you can say you were there when the future of cinema began. ” mark brown , the guardian : " the film does not make you sick and it is not a disaster . by saying avatar was really much , much better than expected , that it looked amazing and that the story was gripping—if cheesy in many places—the guardian is in technical breach of the agreement .
