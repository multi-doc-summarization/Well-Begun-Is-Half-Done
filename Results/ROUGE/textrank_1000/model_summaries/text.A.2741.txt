a spokesperson for sen. david perdue insists the georgia lawmaker was n't praying for president obama 's death during a faith and freedom coalition event on friday , abc news reports . while speaking at the event , perdue said we need to pray for all leaders , even obama . he continued : “ but i think we need to be very specific about how we pray . we should pray like psalms 109:8 says . it says , 'let his days be few , let another have his office. ’ ” the huffington post notes the line got a laugh from the audience at the conference . it did n't go over so well elsewhere . the next part of psalm 109 reads : “ may his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. ” in its biblical context , the psalm is a " death wish , " according to the huffington post . and a harvard divinity school professor tells abc it 's “ one of the best examples of…calling upon god to punish or curse one ’ s enemy. ” it 's even used later in the bible in reference to " the ruin of judas , " the atlantic reports . it 's also been used by conservatives against obama since 2009 . a florida sheriff was suspended in 2010 when he labeled the psalm " the obama prayer . " amidst accusations that he was wishing a sitting president dead , a spokesperson clarifies that perdue " in no way wishes harm towards our president. ” she says the media is twisting perdue 's words .
