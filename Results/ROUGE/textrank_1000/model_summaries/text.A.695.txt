barack obama appears to be shifting into campaign mode . in an interview with diane sawyer of abc news last night , the president was n't afraid to call out his would-be challengers by name , saying , " we 've got a test of mr. romney or mr. gingrich or mr. santorum 's theories . we tried it for 10 years . it resulted in a huge crash . " he also directly took on newt gingrich 's assertion that he is a " food stamp president . " " i do n't put people on food stamps . people become eligible for food stamps , " he said , pointing out that eligibility was expanded under george w. bush , and that " when you have a disastrous economic crash â€¦ more people are going to need more support . " asked how much he wanted another term , he replied , " badly . because i think the country needs it . " he also brushed off his " tense " tarmac showdown with jan brewer . " i 'm usually accused of not being intense enough , right ? " he said . " i think it 's always good publicity for a republican if they 're in an argument with me . but this was really not a big deal . i think this is a classic example of things getting blown out of proportion . "
