two republican representatives who announced earlier this week they would n't support the gop bill to repeal and replace obamacare have done a 180 , giving new hope to the american health care act , the hill reports . fred upton of michigan and billy long of missouri switched to " yes " votes after meeting with president trump on wednesday and successfully adding an amendment to the ahca . according to politico , the amendment puts $ 8 billion in federal funding toward helping people with pre-existing conditions get insurance . " they need to be covered . period , " long says he told trump . upton says he thinks the ahca now has enough votes to pass the house . with the addition of upton 's amendment , at least two other republican representatives say they 'll consider voting for the bill . there was some concern upton 's amendment would scare off the more conservative members of the house , but that does n't appear to have been the case . upton says a house vote on the ahca is possible as soon as thursday . cnbc reports one obamacare advocate says upton 's amendment wo n't actually do anything to help people with pre-existing conditions afford the increased cost of insurance under the ahca ; it amounts to an extra $ 62 for each american with a pre-existing condition .
