some of you have been waiting a long time for this news : justin bieber was arrested this morning . bieber—who was driving a rented lamborghini at the time , nbc miami reports—was busted on suspicion of drag racing , driving under the influence , and resisting arrest in miami beach , according to police . tmz reports that he had just left a club , had a model with him in the car , and failed a field sobriety test . police say bieber admitted to drinking beer , smoking marijuana ( all day long ) , and taking prescription anti-depressants before his arrest , the miami herald reports . he also allegedly cursed out the arresting officers and , as the herald puts it , " babbled incoherently . " he refused , at first , to get out of his car , then refused to remove his hands from his pockets , and did n't have a valid license , according to police sources . in case none of that is infuriating enough , bieber 's posse is said to have blocked traffic in order to create a drag strip for him to use . and this is n't the only controversy related to his trip to florida ; the opa-locka police department is also investigating an unauthorized police escort of bieber after he landed at the opa-locka executive airport . bieber 's currently at county jail and a detective tells abc news he ca n't be bailed out until after noon , because dui suspects are required by law to " dry out " for eight hours .
