own a samsung smart tv ? then take note : your television is not only listening , it 's sending your data to a third party , the independent reports . the tv 's voice-recognition software lets you give it orders , but the product 's privacy policy warns that " personal or other sensitive information ... will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice recognition . " samsung tells the bbc that the third party is nuance , the company that does samsung 's speech-to-text conversion . but intellectual property lawyer corynne mcsherry says it would be nice to see that clarified in samsung 's policy , the daily beast reports . " and i ’ d definitely like to know whether my words were being transmitted in a secure form , " she says . an activist tweets that samsung 's policy sounds a lot like the description of " telescreens " in george orwell 's dystopian novel , 1984—which reads in part , " any sound that winston made , above the level of a very low whisper , would be picked up by [ the screen ] . " unnervingly , it was n't clear how often " the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork . " samsung , however , says it does n't keep voice data , and customers can opt to turn off voice-recognition or even unplug the tv from wi-fi . and samsung is n't alone : the verge reports that xboxes already use voice recognition while being connected to the internet . " samsung 's privacy policy is not unique ; its rhetoric just happens to be similar to that of a well-known sci-fi novel , " the verge says .
