a service billed as a netflix for books is calling it quits after failing to attract enough voracious readers willing to pay $ 9.95 a month for access to 1 million books . oyster , which launched in 2013 , announced in a blog post that it 's going to " sunset " the service over the next few months , the wall street journal reports . the company says it believes " more than ever that the phone will be the primary reading device globally over the next decade , " but it feels " this is best seized by taking on new opportunities to fully realize our vision for e-books . " those new opportunities will apparently be at google , which has hired oyster 's ceo , co-founders , and other team members for google play books , reports re/code . sources say google has paid off oyster investors in what re/code dubs an " acqhire . " where did it go wrong for oyster ? consumers stayed away " because binge-reading is more difficult than binge-watching movies , " and it did n't help that the service could n't be accessed on amazon 's kindle readers , writes steven musil at cnet . the company ended up in direct competition with amazon after it added e-book sales to its subscription service , he notes . people seeking an all-you-can-read service still have the option of amazon 's kindle unlimited service ( which was introduced the year after oyster made its debut ) or , as this columnist notes , libraries .
