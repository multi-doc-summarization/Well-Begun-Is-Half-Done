pluto is gon na be po 'd . while the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of those who deem what counts as a planet , another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first . astronomers at the california institute of technology say a giant celestial body " lurking at the end of our solar system , " as the washington post puts it , may actually be a planet , and they 're even already calling it " planet nine . " in their research published in the astronomical journal , the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the " pluto killer " for his role in getting pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as earth , and per the ap , almost as big as neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet 's orbit . michael " pluto killer " brown and konstantin batygin have n't seen the supposed planet directly , but say they can infer the " massive perturber " exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull , the post notes . what 's interesting is that brown and batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of planet nine . " we thought their idea was crazy , " brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large , hidden planet . but as they did their own research , they soon came to their own conclusion in what brown calls a " jaw-dropping moment " that planet nine could be the real deal . now they 're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they 're not concerned it will face pluto 's fate . " that 's not even a question—it 's definitely a planet , " brown says . not everyone 's convinced . " i have seen many , many such claims in my career , " a planetary scientist at colorado 's southwest research institute tells nature . " and all of them have been wrong . " ( the washington post caught up with brown for a q & a on the latest pluto-killing endeavor . )
