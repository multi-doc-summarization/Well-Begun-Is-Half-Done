all 222 passengers and 19 crew from a singapore airlines flight are safe and unharmed after a terrifying incident early monday . the airline says the boeing 777-3000 was on its way from singapore to milan when the pilot decided to turn back after receiving an engine oil warning message , the ap reports . it landed back at singapore 's changi airport more then four hours laterâ€”and just after it came to a halt , its right engine burst into flames as horrified passengers looked on . " by the time the fire engines reached the plane , the flames were about a meter high , " passenger amit jain tells today . " when we could see the flames rising , some people were trying to remove their bags from the overhead compartments , which was crazy , " he says . " i heard a few people scream 'open the doors ! ' and 'let us out ! ' " the airline and the airport say the blaze was extinguished within minutes , cnn reports . the passengers were transferred to another flight to milan . passengers say they could smell oil while the plane was in the air , but they did n't realize how close to death they were until afterward , the bbc reports . analyst greg waldron at flightglobal says it appears the pilots did everything right by turning back when they discovered the problem and dumping fuel along the way . " when the plane slows down as you land , fuel can cling to the wing and surfaces . sparks from the hot brakes after they landed could have the triggered the fire and it does appear quite dramatic . but they appear to have gotten that under control very quickly , " he says , per reuters . " there do n't appear to be any procedural issues here . "
