kentucky has another high-profile official taking a stand against homosexuality . two years after county clerk kim davis made headlines by refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples , a judge has declared that he wo n't preside over adoption cases involving gay parents . judge mitchell nance announced last week that he would recuse himself from such cases because of his " conscientious objection to the concept of adoption of a child by a practicing homosexual , " reports the glasgow daily times . the move should n't have too much of a practical effect : nance 's 43rd circuit court has two divisions , and the judge who presides over the other division will handle all the gay-adoption cases . nance says he has no choice because his personal objection constitutes a bias that requires him to recuse himself , per the washington post . nance 's decision has set off a debate similar to the one that arose when davis made her own controversial announcement . two quotes illustrate the opposite sides : pro-nance : " when adoption agencies abandon the idea that it is in the best interest of a child to grow up with both a mother and a father , people ca n't expect judges who do believe that to be forced to bow the knee , " says family foundation spokesman martin cothran . " judges have a right of conscience like everyone else. ‚Äù anti-nance : if he " ca n't perform the basic functions of his job , which are to deliver impartiality , fairness and justice to all families in his courtroom , then he should n't be a judge , " says kentucky fairness campaign director chris hartman .
