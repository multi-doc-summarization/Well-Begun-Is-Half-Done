since last month 's grand jury report describing how the former archbishop of pittsburgh reassigned priests accused of abusing children , cardinal donald wuerl has had his name scrubbed from a school , been the subject of protests by catholic schoolteachers , and faced calls from priests and parishioners to resign . resignation is now on the table , the 77-year-old archbishop of washington wrote in a tuesday letter to priests , laying out a plan to discuss the subject with pope francis in rome . wuerl submitted his resignation at age 75 as is required of catholic bishops , but the pope kept him on as one of his top us advisers , per the new york times and cnn . during a meeting two weeks ago , the pope told wuerl to consult with priests about the best way forward , reports the wall street journal . amid questions over whether he knew about molestation claims against his predecessor , former cardinal theodore mccarrick , he heard calls for him both to stay and resign . that showed the need for " some decision , sooner rather than later , on my part , " wuerl writes . noting abuse survivors " have personally suffered so much , " his letter adds non-victims " have also been wounded by the shame of these terrible actions and have questions about their bishop 's ability to provide the necessary leadership . " the letter does n't say whether wuerl will ask the pope to accept his resignation , however . ( carlo maria vigano , the vatican 's former ambassador to the us , said wuerl was complicit in a coverup . )
