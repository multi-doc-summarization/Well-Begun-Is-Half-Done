president trump knew that mike flynn had misled vp mike pence about his contacts with the russian ambassador weeks before pence was informed , it emerged tuesday as the national security adviser 's resignation continued to rock the administration . pence spokesman marc lotter tells the washington post that the vice president " became aware of incomplete information " on feb. 9 following a post story on the issue . the white house , however , says trump and other top administration officials were briefed on the justice department 's concerns about flynn at least two weeks earlier . " it 's not that he was being left out . it was a legal review , " an administration source tells cnn . in other developments : the fbi interviewed flynn in late january after it warned the trump administration that he could be blackmailed , the new york times reports . if authorities determine that he lied during that interview , he could face felony charges . in an interview with the daily caller hours before his resignation , flynn insisted there were " no lines crossed " in his conversation with russian ambassador sergey kislyak . " it was n't about sanctions . it was about the 35 guys who were thrown out , " flynn said , referring to former president obama 's expulsion of russian diplomats in december . " it was basically , 'look , i know this happened . we 'll review everything . ' i never said anything such as , 'we 're going to review sanctions , ' or anything like that . " legal experts tell politico that flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he was n't truthful with the fbi , and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably wo n't work . lawyer mark zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that , as a former director of the defense intelligence agency , flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like russia would be under surveillance . republican senators are among those calling for a full investigation of the flynn affair , but he still has his defenders , including rush limbaugh . on tuesday , the radio host described pressure on flynn as a " political assassination " by the media , the hill reports . " they think they have blood in the water , they 've got a scalp , and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get trump , " he said . the bbc reports that pence and other top us officials will be in europe later this week to reassure american alliesâ€”though nato allies will apparently be untroubled by the departure of flynn , who was seen as " a bizarre and destabilizing appointment .
