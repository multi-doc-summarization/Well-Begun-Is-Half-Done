when george w. bush was introduced to then-vice president of zambia guy scott a few years ago , he thought somebody was joking . scott is a white man whose parents immigrated to the country when it was still a british colony , and the death of president michael sata makes him sub-saharan africa 's first white leader since the end of apartheid in south africa , cnn reports . scott , whose father was active in the anti-colonial movement before independence , has previously served as the country 's agriculture minister . in a 2012 interview with the spectator , scott said his presence in government was a testament to zambia 's stability and tolerance . " i do n't think i would be nearly as welcome in south africa , for example . or west africa , " he said . " i get the suspicion they are pretty dubious , wondering what a white man is doing there . but for some reason , i 'm very popular here . " the country 's constitution calls for a new election within 90 days , but although scott is now the acting president , his parents were not born in zambia , so he may be ineligible to run for the office , reports the bbc .
