many of us may avoid downing hard alcohol , wine , and beer on the same night for fear of a raging hangover the next day . but at the bbc , a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks ' variety itself is n't the problem . instead , claudia hammond points to other possible factors . for instance , she notes , having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol . ( as for " beer before liquor , never been sicker " ? it appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference . ) " the existing evidence suggests that hangovers ca n't be blamed on mixing drinks , " hammond writes . but the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit : congeners , the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process , also contribute to a hangover . tannins , for instance , are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol . there are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka , and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka . so , hammond writes , people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins . so go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire , but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes : a study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer , science daily reported . ( if you do find yourself with a hangover , you may want to reach for a sprite . )
