one of the world 's weirdest bromances appears to be alive and well : dennis rodman has returned to pyongyang for his first visit to north korea since his former celebrity apprentice boss became president , the bbc reports . rodman , who has described dictator kim jong un as a " friend for life , " told reporters he was " just trying to open a door " and he is sure president trump will be " happy with the fact that i 'm over here trying to accomplish something that we both need , " the ap reports . in a tweet , rodman thanked potcoin , a cybercurrency used in marijuana transactions , for sponsoring his trip . he wore a potcoin t-shirt at the airport . rodman 's visit , the first since early 2014 , comes at a time of growing us-north korea tensions . " i know the trump administration has been trying half-heartedly to start a dialogue with the north koreans , " analyst joel wit tells the los angeles times . " it would be strange to use dennis rodman as an intermediary , " he says , " but under the trump administration a lot of things are possible that wouldn â€™ t have been with other administrations . " when rodman suggested in 2014 that trump was interested in visiting pyongyang , trump tweeted : " dennis rodman was either drunk or on drugs ( delusional ) when he said i wanted to go to north korea with him . glad i fired him on apprentice !
