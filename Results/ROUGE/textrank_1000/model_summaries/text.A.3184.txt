if donald trump chooses to roast journalists , celebrities , and politicians at the annual white house correspondents ' dinner in washington , dc , this year , it 'll be with the knowledge that he 's being brutally mocked not too far away . samantha bee of tbs ' full frontal says she 'll host celebrities , journalists , and comedians at a trump roast at the willard hotel in washington on april 29 . bee tells the new york times that the goal of the event , dubbed " not the white house correspondents ' dinner , " is not to " supersede " the official dinner scheduled for the same night , but simply to " ensure that we get to properly roast the president . " she promises " plenty of surprises , " per variety . " if you 're not careful you just might learn something . specifically , you 'll learn how screwed we 'd be without a free press , " she adds . it 's not yet clear when or how the event will be broadcast , or even who will attend , but bee says proceeds will go to the committee to protect journalists . whether the official correspondents ' dinner will happen is also unclear given trump 's tumultuous relationship with the press , his history with the dinner , and " his oft-demonstrated thin skin , " reports the times . the independent notes the dinner has been an annual occurrence since 1983 .
