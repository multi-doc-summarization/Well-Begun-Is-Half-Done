south korea and japan say they 've reached a deal to resolve a disturbing legacy of world war ii—the issue of sex slaves , or " comfort women , " forced to work in japanese brothels for soldiers . an estimated 200,000 women , many of them korean , were forced to take part , though only 46 remain alive today in south korea , reports the bbc . under the deal , japan will pay $ 8.3 million to a fund to help victims , though the new york times says the agreement has vague wording that does n't " clarify whether the responsibility that the japanese government acknowledged was legal or moral . " still , the countries say that if japan does what it has promised , the issue will be " finally and irreversibly resolved . " but the newspaper quotes one survivor who says it does not go far enough . " i will ignore it completely , ” says 88-year-old lee yong-soo , who wants japan to unequivocally admit legal responsibility . the deal does n't go that far , though it comes with an apology from japanese prime minister shinzo abe : he " expresses anew his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women , " says japan 's foreign minister . south korea says it will now consider removing a statue memorializing victims erected by activists outside the japanese embassy in seoul in 2011 . the pact is expected to clear the way for stronger military relations between the two nations , a development that reuters notes will be welcomed by the us because of an increasingly aggressive china .
