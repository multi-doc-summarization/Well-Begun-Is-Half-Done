he used to be a city boy with zero experience with the great outdoors . but that did n't stop masafumi nagasaki from heading to the uninhabited japanese island of sotobanari for what he thought would be a two-year respite from the rest of the world . that was in 1989 , as the man who came to be known as the " naked hermit " ended up sticking around until this past april , a nearly 30-year stay all by his lonesome . the 82-year-old , who long ago eschewed clothing , technology , and other creature comforts and had hoped to die on the island , was removed earlier this year after someone reportedly called authorities out of concern he 'd become too weak , documentary maker alvaro cerezo tells news.com.au . " they took him back to civilization and that 's it , " cerezo says . " they wo n't allow him to return . " cerezo spent five days with nagasaki before he was booted from his " paradise , " where he insists he was never lonely , bored , or sad . a 2012 reuters article reported nagasaki did don clothing once a week to make a boat trip to a settlement an hour away to buy food and water ; he 'd also collect an allowance sent from his family . speaking of family , nagasaki was once married and may have had a couple of kids , but he " does n't like to talk about his past , " cerezo notes . what he missed most from his former life while he was holed up on the island : lighters , per the documentary . what he did n't miss : money and religion . " [ those ] two things are destroying the world , " he says . he also wished he could have been killed by a typhoon during his stay so " nobody [ would ] try to save me . " nagasaki is now living in a government house in a city about 40 miles away from his beloved island . ( this man is one of central europe 's last hermits . )
