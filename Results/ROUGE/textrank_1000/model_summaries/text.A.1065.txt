" these , er , helpful additions were first spotted by the heritage foundation , and conservatives are having a field day with them . " no wonder he always seems so proud of himself , " quips sean mandel of commentary , who was the first to blog about the insertions . the rnc , meanwhile , has set up a fairly hilarious " obama in history " tumblr account , photoshopping the president into everything from the moon landing to washington 's trip across the delaware .
