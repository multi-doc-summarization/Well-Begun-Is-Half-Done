a conservative think tank has pulled a controversial billboard that compared those who believe in global warming to deranged killers . the heartland institute was taking heavy flak for the digital sign in chicago that featured a photo of unabomber ted kaczynski and the question , " i still believe in global warming . do you ? " reports the washington post 's plum line blog . the institute explained on its website that the " experiment " was designed to be deliberately provocative . it had originally planned to follow up with images of osama bin laden and charles manson , among others . an earlier post from the site explained that " the most prominent advocates of global warming " are " murderers , tyrants , and madmen . " it added , helpfully , that " not all global warming skeptics are murderers or tyrants , " notes the guardian , which first spotted the billboard . andrew sullivan at the daily beast thinks it 's everything that 's wrong with the rightâ€” " a refusal to acknowledge scientific reality ; and a brutalist style of public propaganda that focuses entirely on guilt by the most extreme association . " gop rep. james sensenbrenner , a prominent skeptic about global warming , vowed to pull out of an institute-sponsored conference later this month if the ad campaign continued ; it ended soon after .
