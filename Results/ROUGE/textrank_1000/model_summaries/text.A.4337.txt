the ship bound for rome sunk in 1bc and was first discovered off the coast of greece in 1900 . and yet the antikythera shipwreck is still providing new discoveries . the guardian reports an expedition to the site last month turned up a silver tankard , a human bone , and much more . perhaps most exciting : the arm of a bronze statue and evidence that the remains of at least seven bronze statues are still buried there . previous bronze statues found at the antikythera shipwreck were dated to the 4th century bc . bronze statues from that time period are extremely rare , with only about 50 known in the world , according to gizmodo . national geographic reports that based on the positioning of the fingers , the newly discovered arm may belong to a statue modeled on a philosopher . recovering the rest of the statue—and the others at the site—wo n't be easy . the antikythera shipwreck is 180 feet underwater on a slope and has been buried by boulders from a succession of earthquakes starting in the 4th century ad . it will take a lot of time and money to move the boulders , recover the statues , and reconstruct them . also discovered in last month 's expedition was a mysterious bronze disc that the dive team originally thought could be a missing component of the famous antikythera mechanism . the mechanism , often called an " ancient computer , " could predict eclipses and the movements of various heavenly bodies and was discovered at the site . however , x-rays of the disc show it 's engraved with a bull and was likely a piece of decoration for a statue or the ship itself . the next expedition to the antikythera shipwreck is scheduled for spring 2018 . ( an odd item was found at the site in 2016 . )
