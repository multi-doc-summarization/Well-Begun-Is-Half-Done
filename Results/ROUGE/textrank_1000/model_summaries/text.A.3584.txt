the war games may be back on . just two months after president trump announced he had " indefinitely suspended " the " very provocative " military drills by the us and south korea in a move meant to soothe north korean leader kim jong un , defense secretary jim mattis said tuesday there are " no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises , " per buzzfeed . reuters reports the comments come in the midst of a " breakdown in diplomacy " with north korea over denuclearization , though mattis denied any act of bad faith on north korea 's part . referring to the decision " to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the singapore summit , " mattis said " we did what we did at the time for that purpose . " he added there 's been no decision on the next large-scale military exercise , previously set for next spring . un ambassador nikki haley was more pointed in her remarks on north korea tuesday . " are [ the north koreans ] wishing or maybe changing their minds on denuclearization ? it 's possible â€¦ but we 're not changing our minds , " she said , per cbs news .
