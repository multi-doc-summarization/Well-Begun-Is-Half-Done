stormy daniels is again making serious public allegations , but this time they 're against her own attorney . in a statement to the daily beast , daniels goes after michael avenatti on two main fronts . the biggest beef is about money , specifically the cash raised for daniels on a crowdfunding site . she alleges that avenatti refuses to provide details of how the money is being spent even after her repeated demands . " instead of answering me , without my permission or even my knowledge michael launched another crowdfunding campaign to raise money on my behalf , " she wrote . " i learned about it on twitter . " avenatti insists that everything is aboveboard , with the money going toward legal fees as agreed , but another allegation made by daniels might be more damaging for him . in her statement , daniels alleges that avenatti filed a defamation suit against president trump in her name but against her wishes . ( a judge ended up tossing the suit . ) " if he filed the case with her name when it was clear that she told him not to , then he could be sued for that , " new york university law school prof stephen gillers tells the db . " if true , she has a malpractice case against him . i emphasize if true . " as of now , daniels is still represented by avenatti , though she says she 's considering whether to sever ties . avenatti , meanwhile , still has two other suits against trump pending , notes the new york times . ( the attorney faced negative headlines earlier this month on a different matter . )
