a french gamer got quite a shock when she tried to do at least one too many things at the same time . mashable reports twitch user anaplaying was playing a game of league of legends while live-streaming herself , chatting with fans , and flicking a lighter on and off . this , of course , ended with her accidentally lighting her hair on fire while a bunch of strangers watched . in the video , anaplaying appears not to notice the flames for a few seconds before quickly putting them out and sheepishly laughing it off . she does n't appear to have been injured .
