the case of a body dumped in waters off brooklyn using a " mafia-style technique , " as the new york times puts it , seems to indeed have mafia elements . the body found attached to both a cinder block and 5-pound bag of drywall compound on saturday has been identified as carmine carini , 35 . " it was right out of goodfellas , " a police source tells the new york post , which says the cinder block was secured to carini 's legs via an electrical cord ; a blue tarp was duct-taped around his body . " the victim was a reputed mobster 's son , " said police chief of detectives robert k. boyce on tuesday , specifying , " his father had the oc [ organized crime ] ties , not him . " the post says those ties were to the colombo crime family , while the new york daily news says he 's a gambino family associate . the younger carini did have his own troubles with the law , including five years spent in prison in connection with at least 10 muggings he committed in 2003 in the span of an hour . the daily news reports carini was last seen on aug. 30 , with boyce saying police " believe he was in the water friday night . " he reportedly suffered a skull fracture and had been stabbed in the arm and leg ; a fingerprint identification was made .
