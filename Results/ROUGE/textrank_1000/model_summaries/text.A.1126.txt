the future is now ! or , at least , by the end of the year , according to the ceo of airbus . reuters reports tom enders announced monday that the company plans to test a prototype self-piloting flying car by the end of the year . he says airbus has the " technological wherewithal " to make it happen and that they are currently in the " experimentation phase . " enders says the vehicle could be used like a ride-sharing app , help people avoid traffic , and save municipalities money on roads . sounds pretty cool , but a number of naysayers are putting the brakes on our flying car fantasies . slate points out airbus admittedly has n't figured out " sense-and-avoid technology " â€”or , in other words , how to keep its flying cars from smashing into stuff . and jalopnik notes that current designs look less " flying car " and more " flying helicopter , " which is slightly less exciting . also , the whole flying car thing still needs faa approval to become a reality , and that 's probably not going to happen any time soon .
