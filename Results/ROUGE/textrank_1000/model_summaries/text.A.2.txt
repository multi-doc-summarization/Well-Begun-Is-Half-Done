it turns out facebook is only guilty of about half of what it ’ s been accused of in the gay kiss incident . the social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “ kiss-in ” event in london . “ the photo in question does not violate our statement of rights and responsibilities , and was removed in error , ” the site said in a statement , according to the advocate . but facebook did not , as has been reported in several places , take down the kiss-in event itself . here ’ s what happened : the photo facebook took down was posted by the dangerous minds blog to promote the event . in its initial write-up about the incident , the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down . but it was actually the organizer himself who " removed " the event , dangerous minds clarified . organizer paul shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one , as " there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it .
