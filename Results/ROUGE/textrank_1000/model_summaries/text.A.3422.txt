a pittsburgh hospital says it is in the midst of " a very active investigation " after two patients died in its cardiothoracic intensive care unit , which was later found to contain mold . upmc presbyterian hospital 's quality control chief tami minnier says a fungal infection first appeared on the leg of a heart transplant patient last october . a second infection was found on the buttocks of another transplant patient this past june , reports the ap ; both patients died , though doctors are n't sure whether the infections caused the deaths . hospital officials did n't connect the two cases because they occurred so far apart and the molds in each case were different , but related . only when a third type of fungal infection was discovered in a lung transplant patient two weeks ago did hospital workers connect the dots and the icu was closed on sept. 3 , reports the pittsburgh post-gazette . though investigators found mold in toilets and behind the walls of the unit , per wtae , experts are n't sure if it played a role in the deaths as it was a different type than those found in patients . " it 's just heartbreaking , " minnier says . " i ca n't tell you how many hours we have already spent trying to understand it . " minnier says a total of 56 patients have stayed in the icu over the past year . the three patients infected were among eight transplant patients . the unit 's remaining 18 patients have been removed to another part of the hospital while a remediation company clears up the mold , per the gazette . " it 's a hospital , and you bring people here to get well , not to get sick and die , " says the wife of a patient . a mold expert says it â€™ s " very unusual " to see the types of fungi found in the patients in a hospital , but it 's possible recent construction projects at upmc caused an outbreak .
