kim jong un was up bright and early new year 's day to make his first announcement of 2017 : that north korea is in the " final stages " of development of a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile and a test launch is imminent , abc australia reports . in his address on state tv from pyongyang , kim said his country would keep ramping up its nuclear weapons program until the us backs out of holding yearly military exercises in south korea , and he reiterated previous claims that preemptive nuclear strikes were on the table , per the wall street journal . " research and development of cutting-edge arms equipment is actively progressing and icbm rocket test launch preparation is in its last stage , " kim said , per abc . mixed with this ominous message was kim 's revelation that " i have spent the whole year with regrets and a guilty conscience " for not reaching certain goals , spurring a promise to " devote all of myself to the people , " per nk news . although cnn notes kim 's speech was " full of the north 's usual self-congratulatory , lofty proclamations and anti-western rhetoric , " it also adds there may be reason to pay closer attention to kim 's words this time around . north korea stayed busy on the weapons experimentation front throughout 2016 , despite 10 years of un sanctions : it test-launched ballistic missiles at what abc calls an " unprecedented rate , " put a satellite into space in february ( believed to be a test of long-range ballistic missile capabilities ) , and pulled off its fifth nuclear test in september . experts have estimated that north korea 's timeline for being able to mount a weapon on an icbm that could reach us shores is probably still two to three years away , but per cnn , a " high-profile north korean " defector has said kim is set on developing nukes by year 's end " at all costs .
