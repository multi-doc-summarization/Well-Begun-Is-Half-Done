james cameron 's trip to the world 's deepest spot sounds a wee bit like something of a disappointment . the six hours he intended to spend at the bottom of the sea—filming and gathering geology samples—was cut in half when hydraulic fluid started leaking in his submersible . as for his time at the bottom , " i did n't see a fish ... i did n't find anything that looked alive to me , other than a few amphipods in the water , " he says . " i did n't feel like i got to a place where i could take interesting geology samples or found anything interesting biologically , " he noted , according to the new york post . it took him 156 minutes to go down , but only 70 minutes to come back up after he spotted the leak . " the port got coated " with oil , he said , noting that he lost control of the starboard side of the sub . " that 's when i decided to come up . i could n't go any further—i was just spinning in a circle . " but it sounds as though he 's planning to go down again : " next dive . i got ta leave something for the next one , " he said . ( but hey , at least he 's alive . gizmodo rounds up five ways he could have perished , and they do n't sound fun . )
