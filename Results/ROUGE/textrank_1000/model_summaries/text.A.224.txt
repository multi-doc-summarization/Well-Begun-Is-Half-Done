kate mckinnon is dressed down ( " real-person down , " without makeup and in sneakers and a baggy tee ) and skittish like a cat , reacting so warily to her interview with lili anolik for vanity fair that anolik realizes she 's " going to have to approach her slowly , carefully , no false moves . " the writer dives into the career of mckinnon , whom she calls " perhaps the most gifted of a gifted generation of young comics , " reaching back to her first forays into comedy at columbia and her stint with the upright citizens brigade improv group , and culminating with her current turn on snl , where she 's impersonated everyone from kellyanne conway and elizabeth warren to jeff sessions . but it 's her portrayal of hillary clinton , the foil to alec baldwin 's donald trump , that has touched an unexpected nerve and propelled her to household-name status . anolik points out the " intense , instinctive , and visceral " interaction between the two actors . she also notes how mckinnon 's hillary has more " pathos " than versions by previous snl actors , including jan hooks and amy poehler . that pathos was born out of the connection mckinnon forged while trying to channel what she believed may have been clinton 's private thoughts . " i started to feel very close to her , just trying to imagine her inner life , " mckinnon says . the subject of the real hillary is broached , though anolik notes that " kate actually says very little … because she gets too overwhelmed to say it . " the cat that is mckinnon also backs away on " soft , padded paws " when anolik brings up her personal life , which " since i 'm no cop and kate 's certainly no criminal … i lean across the table and switch off the tape recorder . " anolik 's full piece on mckinnon is here .
