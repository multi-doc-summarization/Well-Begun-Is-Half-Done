members of the congressional black caucus , some of whom may have been having a hard time getting excited about voting for hillary clinton , got an angry warning saturday night about a trump presidency from the man preparing to pack up and leave the oval office in january . " you may have heard hillary 's opponent in this election say that there 's never been a worse time to be a black person , " president obama said in his final address to the group as president , per cnn . " i mean , he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or jim crow , " adding , " we will educate him . " as for the black community 's supposed indifference about this election , " read up on your history . it matters . i will consider it a personal insult—an insult to my legacy—if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election . you want to give me a good sendoff ? go vote . " more from the speech , which politico calls " rip-roaring " : on what 's on the ballot : “ my name may not be on the ballot , but our progress is on the ballot . tolerance is on the ballot . democracy is on the ballot . justice is on the ballot . good schools are on the ballot . ending mass incarceration , that ’ s on the ballot right now. ” sources tell politico obama strayed significantly from a more staid version of the speech . on donald trump : he 's " somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life . " on the end of the birther controversy : " i mean : ( isis ) , north korea , poverty , climate change—none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate . and to think : that with just a 124 days to go , under the wire , we got that resolved .
