paul ryan , a man who is not running for president and swears that he does n't want the job , continues to get about as much press about it as the official remaining candidates . in his politico playbook on monday , mike allen talks to a republican in the know who " sees a 60 % chance of a convention deadlock , and a 90 % chance that delegates turn to ryanâ€”ergo , a 54 % chance that ryan , who 'll start the third week of july as chairman of the republican national convention , will end it as the nominee . " ryan , meanwhile , tells the times of israel while on a visit to jerusalem that he 's not interested . " no , i 've already said that that 's not me , " he tells the newspaper . of course , as allen and steve benen at msnbc point out , ryan said much the same thing about becoming house speaker before accepting the job as john boehner 's successor . saying he does n't want the job gives him " maximum leverage " and sets up a scenario in which he 's " begged to do it , " writes allen . benen thinks those in the gop hoping for just this scenario should be careful : " the republican party would find itself in late july with a presidential nominee who has no campaign infrastructure , no platform , no stump speech , no staff , and no money .
