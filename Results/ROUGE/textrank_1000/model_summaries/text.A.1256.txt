cnn 's piers morgan thinks gun-rights proponent alex jones 's memorable appearance on his show last night made a fine case—for his opponents . " he was the best advertisement for gun control you could wish for , " morgan tells politico , referring to the conservative radio host . " that kind of vitriol , hatred , and zealotry is really quite scary . " jones is the guy who started the white house petition to get morgan deported because of the cnn host 's push for stricter gun laws . the white house last night promised to respond to the petition because it easily surpassed the threshold of 25,000 signatures , notes the daily caller . but " it is worth remembering that the freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy , " said spokesman jay carney , suggesting jones better not hold his breath . jones himself , meanwhile , posted a video after his cnn appearance , telling supporters that " if something happens to us , or we ’ re killed by crackheads , it was the nypd or mafia they hired , " reports mediaite . yeah , that 's right : “ if you don ’ t know that ( mayor ) bloomberg is total mafia , you ’ re on another planet .
