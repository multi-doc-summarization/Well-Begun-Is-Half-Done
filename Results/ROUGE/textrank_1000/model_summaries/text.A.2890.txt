the search for malaysia airlines flight 370 is growing , officials say , as searchers prepare to map a wide swath of the ocean floor in a new phase of the effort . " we know very clearly the area of the follow-up search will be even broader , with more difficulties and tougher tasks , " says china 's transport minister . " for the next stage involving sonar and other autonomous vehicles , potentially at very great depths , we need to have an understanding of the ocean floor , " says australia 's deputy pm , per cnn . the new search area has " never been mapped . " officials will be looking for help from private companies ; they doubt firms will need much financial incentive , usa today reports . " there 's no reward big enough , " says malaysia 's acting transport minister , but if a company can find the plane , it will win instant worldwide fame , he notes . search leaders are hoping a single firm will take on the task to avoid continued coordination problems , the wall street journal notes . officials also plan to go through all existing data once again . " it 's very sensible to go back " to be certain " there are no flaws in thatâ€”the assumptions are right , the analysis is right , and the deductions and conclusions are right , " says search coordinator angus houston .
