keith olbermann stormed off twitter in a huff yesterday , after finding himself the recipient of a barrage of tweets condemning him and michael moore for defending julian assange . olbermann had moore on his show tuesday to talk about the wikileaks founder , and nodded in sympathy as moore declared the rape allegations against assange “ hooey. ” that enraged readers at the blog tiger beatdown , who barraged the pair with tweets accusing them of being “ rape apologists. ” moore hasn ’ t responded , but olbermann did—and it didn ’ t go well . the host bickered with seemingly every critic ( see salon for details ) , eventually issuing an if-i-offended-anyone apology . then he began blocking offending tweeters , and finally , when he could stand it no more , he tweeted , “ i 'll thus unblock all blocks , wish you all a merry christmas and i 'll suspend this account until/if this frenzy is stopped. ” since then he ’ s posted one tweet—an innocuous congratulations to larry king .
