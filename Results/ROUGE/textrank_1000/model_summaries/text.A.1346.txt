turkey and japan today joined a number of nations who have given syrian diplomats within their borders the boot , as the head of the un observers in syria revealed that 13 bodies had been found with their hands tied in the country 's east , reports reuters . but the developments are unlikely to chip away at russia and china 's resistance to taking tougher steps against syria . to wit , russia 's deputy foreign minister today announced that russia is " categorically against " military intervention in syria and noted that it would be " premature " for the un security council to take any fresh steps . the bbc notes that , in light of russia 's veto power on the council , the latest remarks indicate there 's little hope for new initiatives . and the overall lack of progress is only underscored by the fact that kofi annan this morning left syria—without getting the government to agree to take any of the " bold steps " he was pushing , reports voice of america . writing for the washington post , david ignatius thinks the answer is easy—bashar al-assad needs to go—and the reason why that 's not happening is obvious : vladimir putin , who is " playing a cynical game of power politics . " the focus should n't be on pressuring assad , but on turning " up the heat on putin , " he writes .
