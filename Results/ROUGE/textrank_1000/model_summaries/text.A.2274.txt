a buzzfeed investigation this year found at least 29 us police dogs had died of heatstroke in their handlers ' cars over the past seven years . but a new analysis of 619 deaths since 2011 by the green bay press-gazette raises that number to at least 46 dogs , with 18 others succumbing to heatstroke during other activities ( e.g. , training exercises , being tethered outside in the sun ) , putting heatstroke as the no . 1 cause of police dog deaths for non-medical reasons . failures in the cars ' ac or other equipment were factors in 19 of the 46 cases , while officer negligence was blamed in 26 . one especially egregious case in 2013 involved 10 us customs and border protection dogs who died after the ac failed . " those dogs were essentially in an oven , " a rep said at the time . " you do n't have to be an animal lover to be sick about this . " it 's unclear exactly how many police dogs die this way , since agencies do n't have to report it , the press-gazette notes ; instead , stats are typically culled from memorial websites and other sources . " it is a painful , horrible death , " a veterinary specialist told buzzfeed . departments are taking measures including replacing faulty heat-alarm units , mounting fans in car windows , and inspecting ac units more regularly . but advocates say it comes down to human diligence . " it 's not a matter of changing policy , " the director of a wisconsin canine handler group tells the press-gazette . " check on your dog . " an animal legal defense fund director puts it in harsher terms : " an officer who allows a dog to die of heat exhaustion on duty is as neglectful as leaving a service revolver on a school playground . " ( a florida officer was " distraught " after two police dogs died in his car . )
