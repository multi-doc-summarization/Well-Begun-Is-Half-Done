the us ambassador to new zealand and samoa is blaming the " blood sport " of politics for the kerfuffle he 's in over comments he made while visiting the latter islands . per the new york times , witnesses told local media that former massachusetts sen. scott brown acted " obnoxiously " at a july peace corps event in apia . brown confirmed wednesday to new zealand 's stuff that there had indeed been an " administrative inquiry " by the us state department into his behavior and that he 'd been warned to be more " culturally aware . " the guardian reports the complaints apparently came from two female peace corps members . the remarks revolve around him telling guests at the event they looked " beautiful , " as well as noting to a waitress she could make " hundreds of dollars " if she were a waitress in america . but while brown says he did compliment guests on their appearance , he says he 'd seen them before the event looking " dirty and grungy " and that they 'd cleaned up so nice he felt compelled to compliment them . he also says he made comments about both women and men , and that his wife , gail huff , made similar remarks . as for the waitress , he says he was simply noting she was doing a " great job , " per the times . why he thinks the complaints against him are politically motivated : he 's a trump supporter said to have the president 's ear . " at this event there were a lot of people [ who ] did n't like [ trump ] , " he told stuff . " sadly , it 's politics , and it is what it is . " he did note , however , he 'll try to be more culturally sensitive in the future . huff says the experience " has been a real learning curve " and that she was by her husband 's side at all times and " literally saw nothing . it 's absurd .
