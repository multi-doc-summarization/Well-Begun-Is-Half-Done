the coelacanth does n't just look like a prehistoric fish , it was believed to be one , extinct for some 70 million years—until one turned up at a south african fish market in 1938 . now , scientists have decoded the endangered species ' genome , and they say they 've found some clues as to how today 's land animals evolved from a fish ancestor , reports the new york times . first , some fascinating backstory : the times explains that the coelacanth and lung fish—both " lobe-finned fish " —have been duking it out for the title of the closet relative to that first ancestral fish that used its fins to walk on land . post-decoding , the lungfish emerges as the closer relative , but in the times ' telling , the " coelacanth may have the last laugh " —that 's because the lungfish genome is too long to decode using current technology . what scientists learned from the coelacanths ' dna : even though coelacanths do n't have a placenta , they have a gene related to one that allows land animals to grow a placenta . a dna sequence found in coelacanths , but not ordinary fish , bolsters the genes that helps an embryo grow limbs . researchers actually injected the coelacanth 's sequence into mice ; " it lit up right away and made an almost normal limb , " says one . you can check out the original article at nature .
