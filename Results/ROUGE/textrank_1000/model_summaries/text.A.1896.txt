the highlight of did you hear about the morgans ? for most critics is their own joke that sam elliott 's mustache deserves separate billing . some reactions : the film is so " lumpish and crude " that colin covert saves most of his ire for a geographical offense . " the landscape around yellowstone , where the film is supposedly set , is one of america 's great scenic wonders , " he writes in the minneapolis star tribune . " the movie was actually filmed in tax-break haven new mexico , and it looks blah . inexcusable . " if you enjoy silence , michael phillips writes in the chicago tribune , then this is for you . " each of its theoretical punch lines is preceded by an eerie second or two of dead air , followed by the jokelike 'payoff , ' guiltily delivered by one of its game cast members , followed by a longer awkward pause . " oh , come on , robert wilonsky writes in la weekly . this " multiplex meringue " is a " thoroughly delightful throwaway , " and hugh grant is " the most reliable deadpan smart-ass this or that side of the atlantic . " no , really , this is unbearable . sarah jessica parker wears a look of " dostoevskian unhappiness , " while grant acts as though " he just pulled an all-nighter in an emergency room , " michael o'sullivan writes in the washington post . " if they 're not having fun , how the heck are we supposed to ? "
