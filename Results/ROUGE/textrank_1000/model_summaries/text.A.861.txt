" happy , " is how soccer star abby wambach put it on instagram , tacking on an # iseethemoonnow . " the photo was one posted a day earlier on facebook by prominent christian mommy blogger glennon doyle melton , who wrote " abby and i decided to hold hands forever . love wins . " the image shows two hands , each featuring a diamond ring . the engagement announcement came just three months after melton went public with her relationship with the 36-year-old , which came about three months after she announced she was separating from husband craig melton in a lengthy post on her momastery blog . wambach 's own marriage unraveled following an april dui arrest . people describes melton as a long-time same-sex marriage supporter , and cites this 2013 post : " figuring out my stance on homosexuality felt like a life and death decision . i know my jesus , i love him , and i think if he needed me to believe that homosexuality was a sin , he would have mentioned it . " melton has three kids—son chase and daughters tish and amma—and people quotes her speaking on her own same-sex relationship . " when craig and i sat them down to tell them about abby i started by saying : 'in our family , we live and tell the truth about who we are no matter what , and then love each other through it—and i 'm about to show you how that ’ s done . ' "
