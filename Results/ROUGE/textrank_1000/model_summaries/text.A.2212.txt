steve jobs revolutionized apple in his second go-round with the company , taking the stock from a split-adjusted $ 6.05 per share in 1996 to $ 376 today . but with jobs resigning as ceo , everyone is wondering what the future holds for apple . some reactions : what will change ? not much , write nathan olivarez-giles and thomas suh lauder for the la times . in his role as ceo , jobs had to answer to two groups : shareholders , and the board of directors . now he 's at the helm of that board . it was the perfect time to go , writes brian barrett for gizmodo , noting that the coming release of the iphone 5 and more affordable iphone 4 should buoy the company and give ceo tim cook a chance to step into the spotlight . " if they 'd waited any longer , the iphone 5 announcement would 've been fully shrouded in memories of jobs . ... this feels calculated , in the best possible way , to happen at the best possible time . now . " apple has lost its core , writes rupert goodwins for zdnet , and only time will tell how this plays out . the iphone and ipad can only be updated so many times , and with jobs " there was always a 'next . ' " but " apple as innovator without jobs is apple unknown . " its future " depends on the new next , and the longer we have to wait to see what happens , the less likely it will happen at all . "
