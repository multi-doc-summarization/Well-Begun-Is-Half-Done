a month ago , lamar austin was hired by a security company for a 90-day trial period that involved him being on call 24/7 . on new year 's day , austin 's son was born . austin , who had already had to miss one shift offered to him due to a doctor 's appointment for his wife , ended up missing shifts on friday and saturday . son cainan was born sunday , and at 1am that day , austin got a text notifying him he 'd been terminated from salerno protective services . austin 's story made headlines , especially due to the fact that cainan was the first baby born in concord , nh , in 2017 . " if i have to choose between work and family , i ’ m always going to pick my family , " austin told the monitor shortly after his son 's birth . since then , people have been stepping up to help austin , a 30-year-old military veteran and father of four , big-time . he 's gotten offers for at least three jobs , plus money raised for him on a gofundme page set up by a mother who was upset by what happened to austin—even though , as experts explain to the concord monitor , it 's perfectly legal in an " at-will " employment state such as new hampshire . in a statement reported by wcvb , anthony salerno jr. cited confidentiality in not commenting on the particulars of the situation , but did say " sps is not in the practice of releasing employees for reasons stated in the article published in the monitor [ sic ] but must be cognizant of the product we give our clients ! " but there 's no bad blood , austin tells the monitor . " [ salerno ] had his company , which is like his baby , and i had my baby ... naturally , he ’ s going to pick his baby over my baby . i ca n't blame him for that . " ( this waitress lost her job for firing a shot at robbers . )
