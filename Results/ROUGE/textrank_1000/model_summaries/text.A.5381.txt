the democratic national committee has agreed to restore access to voter files for the bernie sanders campaign , cooling tensions in what politico calls a " civil war " within the party over the sanders campaign 's improper accessing of clinton campaign data . the dnc agreed to restore access soon after the sanders campaign made good on its threat to file a lawsuit but the two sides described the development in very different ways , reports the washington post . the sanders campaign said the dnc had " capitulated " and " reversed its outrageous decision , " while the dnc 's statement said it had decided to restore access because the sanders campaign had agreed to " fully cooperate with the continuing dnc investigation of this breach . " the issue has caused angry words to be exchanged ahead of saturday night 's debate , the ap reports . the clinton campaign seemed especially annoyed by a sanders fundraising email accusing the dnc of " tipping the scales " for clinton . " they stole data as a reason to raise money for their campaign , " clinton campaign manager robby mook said , per politico . he said the breach was far more than the " inadvertent glimpse into our data " the sanders campaign has described . " it 's outrageous to suggest that our campaign 'stole ' any data , " countered sanders spokesman michael briggs . " what is true is the data we collected and need to run a winning campaign is now being stolen from us by a dnc dominated by clinton people . "
