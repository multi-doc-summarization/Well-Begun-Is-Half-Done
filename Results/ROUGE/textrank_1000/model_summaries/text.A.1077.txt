tonight ’ s the night ! at 7pm ct , iowa republicans will gather to cast the first votes in the republican nominating season . consider this your pregame report , with info from politico , mother jones , and the des moines register : the frontrunners : polls show ron paul , mitt romney , and rick santorum are poised to grab the proverbial “ three tickets out of iowa. ” romney doesn ’ t need to win to remain the favorite for the nomination , but anything less than a respectable second will be damaging . turnout is everything : if it ’ s high , that ’ s probably a good sign for romney . if it ’ s low , it ’ s a good sign for paul and/or santorum—depending on where it ’ s concentrated . bad weather is thought to favor paul ’ s band of enthusiastic supporters . location , location , location : romney ’ s support is strongest in eastern iowa , santorum should fare well in the northwest , and paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as ames . politico highlights 10 counties to watch here . the battle for fourth : if either newt gingrich or rick perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth , they might be able to stay in the race . last-minute campaigning : romney held rallies in four cities yesterday , his most since 2008 . paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in des moines , hoping to grab media buzz . and santorum appeared with the cast of 19 kids and counting , the tlc reality show beloved by iowa homeschoolers . some intriguing numbers : paul ’ s favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week . only 76 % of santorum ’ s supporters say they ’ ll definitely caucus for him . romney , meanwhile , has at some point trailed five different candidates in iowa—and is now polling at exactly the same 18 % he was at in january .
