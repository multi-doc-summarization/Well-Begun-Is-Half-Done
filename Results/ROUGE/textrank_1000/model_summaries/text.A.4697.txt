halloween is james yochim 's favorite time of year : " i get really excited about going to haunted houses . " his friday night at nashville nightmare in madison—a sprawling attraction with four haunted houses , an escape room , and scary cast members running around with fake weapons—might dull the thrill , however . yochim says a thin man with skull makeup , assumed to be an actor , approached his friend , tawnya greenfield , asking if yochim was " f—ing around with her , " per buzzfeed . when she jokingly said yes , the man handed her a knife and said " stab him , " yochim tells the nashville tennessean . " keep in mind , we 'd been chased by chainsaws , holding other weapons , all kinds of stuff all night , and it was all fake , " he adds . " so she stabs at me with it , and everything got really black . " the blade—very much real—went through the 29-year-old 's forearm . though it did n't hit any major arteries , bones , or tendons , " his arm was gushing blood like something out of a horror scene , " greenfield tells fox 17 . nine stitches later , yochim recalls the unknown man apologizing as he lay bleeding , saying , " i did n't know my knife was that sharp . " but according to yochim , there were no weapons allowed inside the attraction and visitors were required to go through " very thorough " metal detectors . in a tuesday statement , nashville nightmare 's organizers said an employee believed to be " involved in some way " had been placed on leave " until we can determine his involvement . " an initial police report said the suspect had not been identified . no charges have been laid .
