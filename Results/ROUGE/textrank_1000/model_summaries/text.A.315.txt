nicotine . caffeine . betel nuts . you may never have heard of them , but nuts from the areca palm are hugely popular as a chewable stimulant : almost a tenth of the global population enjoys them , the bbc reports . a millennia-old tradition , they 're the world 's fourth-most-popular psychoactive substance , healthline adds . their effect is similar to that of drinking six cups of coffee , and many workers engaged in lengthy physical tasks chew them to maintain alertness . trouble is , they 're incredibly dangerous . potentially leading to oral cancer and terrible mouth lesions , they 're likely responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths , the bbc notes . in taiwan , about 5,400 men receive oral cancer diagnoses each year ; as many as 90 % of them are betel nut chewers . the situation is only made worse by the way betel nuts are often packaged : in what are called quids , which can be made using known carcinogens like tobacco and slaked lime . the latter can generate small abrasions in the mouth that may help the carcinogens get into the body . despite the dangers , betel nuts are called " taiwan 's chewing gum , " and about half the country 's men are n't aware of the cancer issue , an expert says—even as people like qiu zhen-huang develop holes in their cheeks . decades after he quit the stuff , he ended up with a golf ball-sized tumor . the fda does n't consider betel nuts safe , healthline notes , and in recent years , taiwan has been fighting their use—though it remains legal , shanghaiist reports . free screenings and other programs helped cut men 's chewing rates in half two years ago , the bbc notes . ( as for smoking : keep doing it , and there 's a 67 % chance you 'll die from it , a study finds . )
