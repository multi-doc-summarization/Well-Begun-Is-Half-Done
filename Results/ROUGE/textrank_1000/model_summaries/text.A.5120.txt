the specifics of president obama 's plans for syria do n't seem much clearer after a conference call with congressional leaders . the call did n't include information on when a strike would occur , politico notes , nor did it appear to sway lawmakers who had doubts about military action . during the call , which involved top officials including john kerry , chuck hagel , and susan rice , the administration discussed an intercepted phone call it called proof the syrian government used chemical weapons , the wall street journal reports—though the call does n't directly implicate bashar al-assad , the new york times notes . the white house 's goal is " preventing assad from using chemical weapons again , " a democratic aide said . as to the british vote against using force , the administration said that " the president will make a decision based on what is best for the us and not what other countries would do , " said rep. eliot engel , the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee . " i do n't think the uk ought to have a veto on what the us does or does n't do . " officials said obama still had n't settled on a course of action—but the times says " all indications " suggest a strike on the heels of the un 's departure from damascus tomorrow . but we may know more soon : a senior administration official tells cnn the administration will today release declassified intelligence supporting the claim that the syrian regime launched a chemical attack .
