antony britton 's plan : to pull a harry houdini and claw his way to the surface after being handcuffed and buried underneath 6 feet of soil . but his charity stunt in west yorkshire on saturday took an almost deadly turn when the escape artist was smothered by the dirt and passed out , the guardian reports . " the soil was … compacting and crushing me , " he tells the paper . " i remember then getting my right arm stuck in the soil and i started passing out . at that point … i just remember thinking it 's up to the ground crew to do their job . " he adds , per the huddersfield daily examiner : " i could feel myself losing consciousness and there was nothing i could do about it . i was pretty much dying . " but rescuers came through , nine minutes into britton 's attempt , and cleared dirt from his throat and administered oxygen while spectators watched in tears , notes the guardian . britton 's minor injuries : some scrapes , bruises , and a cracked rib . the escape , which he was doing to raise money for leukemia and lymphoma research , is only believed to have been attempted ( and failed ) twice before in the last century , including once by houdini himself . even though britton tells the examiner he 's disappointed he passed out just 2 feet from the surface , he says he wo n't be trying this trick again . ( then there 's the case of florida 's " prison houdini . " )
