it was n't a very happy holiday season for upsâ€”for the second year in a row . in 2013 , the company landed in hot water over an unexpected surge in gifts needing delivery , resulting in some 1.3 million packages that were n't delivered by christmas eve . this year , things went the opposite direction : the company hired an extra 100,000 seasonal workers , consumerist notes , but the uptick in business did n't quite pan out as hoped . the result of all this is new costs for consumers . ups plans a surcharge for residential deliveries , set to take effect over the course of a few years , reuters reports . " we absolutely will charge our customers more for the extra costs that we had in peak , " ceo david abney tells the wall street journal . home deliveries can place a special burden on the company , it says , because homes typically get just one package at a time , whereas a business might receive a pile . customers may end up seeing higher shipping costs at online retailers , as well as more emphasis on pickup locations like amazon lockers in retail stores , consumerist notes .
