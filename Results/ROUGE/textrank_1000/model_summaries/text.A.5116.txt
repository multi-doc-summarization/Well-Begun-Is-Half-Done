officials have released a name in the case of the american nanny found dead in her vienna , austria , apartment on tuesday night , but beyond that , much remains unclear . abc news reports lauren mann , 25 , died by suffocation , though it notes that vienna police rep thomas keiblinger earlier referenced a preliminary autopsy that found no indications of strangulation . nbc news echoes the report of suffocation , but cbs news and the ap report the autopsy was inconclusive , and their reports do n't mention suffocation . cbs cites officials who on thursday confirmed mann was not strangled , shot , or stabbed . the case is being treated as a homicide , and an official tells nbc news " third party involvement can not be excluded " ; police say there are no suspects at this time . keiblinger says it 'll take a week or two for the toxicology report to be completed , which has cbs saying her death " could be [ a ] mystery for weeks . " abc reports mann failed to pick up one of her charges from school on monday , but her half-dressed body was n't found until 6pm the following day . the colorado native was a graduate of the university of colorado-boulder 's college of music .
