the latest fire on an oil and gas platform in the gulf of mexico yesterday may not have spilled more oil into the gulf , but it has further polluted the industry 's image . the accident is going to make it harder for the industry to argue that the deepwater horizon disaster was a fluke as it fights tighter regulation and a moratorium on deep-water drilling , energy experts tell the wall street journal . the platform engulfed by fire yesterday was in shallow water and it was n't drilling when the accident occurred , but analysts say the fire adds to perceptions among some lawmakers that the industry is unsafe and under-regulated . the platform has a history of maintenance and repair issues and its owner , mariner energy , has been involved in at least a dozen offshore accidents since 2006 , including four fires and a minor blowout , the houston chronicle reports .
