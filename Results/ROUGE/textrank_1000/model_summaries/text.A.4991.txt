academics at beijing normal university recently compiled a report ranking how " socially responsible " chinese celebrities are , and china 's highest-paid actress , fan bingbing , received a 0 % ratingâ€”which would be eyebrow-raising enough , except that fan has also gone missing . the bbc reports the 36-year-old x-men actress , model , and singer has n't been seen since her last public showing at a children 's hospital on july 1 , and business insider notes her social media posts dried up about a month before that . her boyfriend , actor li chen , also seemingly vanished at the beginning of the summer . meanwhile , a watchdog site covering social media censorship in china notes that concerned supporters who wondered online what had happened to fan have since seen their posts scrubbed . fan vanished not long after state-run tv suggested the contract with her entertainment company misrepresented what she earned so she could pay less in taxes . her studio said the report was " slander , " per channel newsasia . then came the celebrity-ranking report in which fan ranked last , with just nine of the 100 celebrities reviewed on their work , philanthropy , and personal integrity deemed to be " socially responsible . " the bbc notes that celebrities " who voice opinions in line with government rhetoric " generally get more praise and positive press in china . there have been whispers fan was arrested by the chinese government for tax evasion , and a cryptic article has fueled that rumor : the state-run securities daily posted a story last week saying fan was " under control " and " will accept the legal decision " ; the article was yanked a few hours later .
