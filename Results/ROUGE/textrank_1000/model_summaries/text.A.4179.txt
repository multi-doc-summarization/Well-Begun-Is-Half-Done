in 2013 , 32.7 % of all babies delivered in america were born by cesarean section . if that sounds high , well , check out brazil 's stats . the bbc reports that at private hospitals , 85 % of women deliver by cesarean ; in public hospitals , it 's about half that ( 45 % ) . in 2013 npr reported the figure for some private hospitals is 99 % ; one doctor npr spoke with could hardly recall the last time he handled a vaginal delivery . the world health organization recommends a 10 % to 15 % rate . in an effort to get closer to that figure , brazil is now making it a little more , well , laborious to have a cesarean . new rules were introduced yesterday , reports afp , and going forward , there 's more paperwork . after women are told about the risks ( now required ) , they 'll have to sign a consent form ; a doctor will have to fill out a form that asks for the justification of the procedure . but forms may not solve what some women say is the real issue : a lack of beds . those who want to deliver in a private hospital report that the beds are often completely preassigned to women who 've booked a cesarean , forcing them to , in some instances , go to hospital after hospital while in labor . afp reports doctors play a role , too , with some saying doctors encourage women to take the scheduled route , which helps quash middle-of-the-night working hours . as one pediatrician puts it , mass cesareans are the country 's " international shame .
