twenty years later , the man found guilty of murdering michael jordan 's father may get a fresh trial . attorneys for the convicted gunman , daniel green , say the original trial was rife with problems that only now are coming to light , the charlotte observer reports . to recap , green and larry demery were teenagers when they were tried for murdering 56-year-old james jordan—whose son was an all-time great nba player—during a 1993 carjacking in south carolina . in the high-profile trial , demery became a witness for the state and accused green of pulling the trigger . with physical evidence apparently supporting demery , both were found guilty and eligible for parole in 20 years , but green got an added 10 years for conspiracy . now demery is up for parole consideration , and green 's attorneys are claiming that : the trial 's jury forewoman broke the rules by conducting her own investigation of the murder . other jurors may have violated orders by reading or seeing accounts of the case . a state forensics expert admits that her testimony about blood in the car ( which supported demery 's version of events ) was shaky , and she destroyed the only existing blood sample from james jordan on a supervisor 's orders . the editor of a local native american newspaper said that during a jail interview , demery admitted to pulling the trigger . the first person the killers called from james ' car phone was a cocaine dealer who happened to be robeson county sheriff hubert stone 's out-of-wedlock son , but the jury was n't allowed to hear about the sheriff 's connection . details about that could undermine " the entire jordan investigation , " the attorneys say . a judge is likely to rule on the attorneys ' request sometime after the end of april , says bleacher report .
