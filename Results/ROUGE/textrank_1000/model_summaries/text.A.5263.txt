sadly , it 's beginning to look like the loch ness monster does not have a cousin in alaska , but a video shot by a bureau of land management worker was fun all the same . in the original facebook post , the blm said the video " captured this strange 'thing ' swimming in the chena river in fairbanks . " the " thing " quickly became known as the alaska ice monster , with all kinds of crazy theories from commenters about what it might be . npr rounds up some of them , including a giant sturgeon , a lost shark , a " beavegator " ( no idea ) , a nessie-ish creature , and a " giant arctic crocodile . " mother nature news took note of this one : " what is the likelihood that this is a whale that seriously lost its way from the yukon river , transferring across other small river fjords into the chena ? " alas , the blm then updated with a less exciting explanation . " so far the most compelling explanation ... is that the video shows 'frazil ice stuck to a rope that is probably caught on a bridge pier . ' " frazil ice is " a kind of loose , slushy ice that forms on water , " explains alaska dispatch news . " it looks like it 's swimming upstream but it 's actually stationary and just wading in the current , " a biologist with the state 's department of fish and game says of the formerly mysterious subject of the video , adding , " it 's not organic . " not that the fun is necessarily over . " such a clear , scientific explanation is n't likely to stop the multiplication of more 'creative ' stories about the alaska 'ice monster , ' " observes the christian science monitor . ( a drone hunting for nessie had a weird false alarm . )
