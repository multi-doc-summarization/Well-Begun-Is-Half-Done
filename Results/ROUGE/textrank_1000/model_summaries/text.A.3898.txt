" did i hear the word bipartisan ? " president trump asked wednesday as he announced his support for a major reform of prison and sentencing laws . the first step act , which the ap calls the " first major rewrite of the nation 's criminal justice sentencing laws in a generation , " was created by a bipartisan group of senators and will remove some of the harsher minimum sentencing laws passed in the 1990s . " we 're all better off when former inmates can re-enter society as law-abiding , productive citizens , " trump said . " americans from across the political spectrum can unite around prison reform legislation that will reduce crime while giving our fellow citizens a chance at redemption . " the bill , which builds on one the house passed in may , includes a boost to rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and bans practices including the shackling of pregnant women , the guardian reports . it 's not clear whether it will go to a vote during the lame-duck session of congress , though senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says it will go to the floor if 60 votes can be guaranteedâ€”depending on how it " stacks up " with other priorities . the bill is opposed by some conservatives , though its broad range of support includes both the aclu and the koch brothers , the new york times reports . it earned the support of the national fraternal order of police last week . ( last year , jeff sessions brought back tougher drug sentences . )
