in october 2007 , a 14-year-old girl was kidnapped while looking for a pay phone in the beacon hill section of seattle and repeatedly raped by her abductor over the next couple of days before escaping . now , 11 years later , police may have their manâ€”but they may have had him much sooner if there had n't been a massive backlog in testing a pile of rape kits . komo news reports that , among the more than 1,000 kits stockpiled by the seattle police department , was the one that made a dna match to darin bolar at the end of last year , leading to the 52-year-old 's arrest on sept. 26 . bolar , a level iii sex offender , already had a rape conviction under his belt from 25 years ago after assaulting another 14-year-old at a theme park . in the beacon hill case , the suspect had first grabbed the girl and raped her in some nearby bushes , then forced a garden hose into her vagina to try to clear out any evidence of the assault , per police reports . he then allegedly took the girl back to his home , where she was beaten , raped , and made to clean his house for the next two days . she finally said to have escaped while the suspect was at work and another man slept on the couch . she was tested immediately for forensic evidence , but that kit was n't tested until december 2017 . the seattle post-intelligencer notes that a $ 3m doj grant was given to the state 's ag office in 2017 to help start testing the more than 6,400 untested rape kits across washington . bolar has been charged with first-degree kidnapping and second-degree rape .
