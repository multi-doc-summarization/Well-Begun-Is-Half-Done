superbugs such as mrsa are already bad enough . but it turns out that something can make them even nastier : cigarette smoke . researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill , they explain at eureka alert . it 's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses , explains the union-tribune of san diego . scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of mrsa , one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract . the bigger the dose of smoke , the bigger the effect , notes medical daily . " we already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells , and now we 've shown that , on the flipside , smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive , " says lead author laura crotty alexander of uc san diego . it 's a double-whammy : smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases , and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous . in this study , the smoke helped mrsa survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia . ( the latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus . )
