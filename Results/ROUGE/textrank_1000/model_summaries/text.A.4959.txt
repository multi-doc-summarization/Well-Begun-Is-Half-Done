big oil 's lobbyists have lost a fight over cleaner gasoline : the epa will require refiners to reduce the amount of sulfur to cut down on smog , reports the washington post . the cut is a sizable one , dropping the allowable limit by two-thirds from 30 parts per million to 10 . backers say the move will eventually save the us billions in health care costs , but the oil industry disputes that and says the only tangible result will be higher gas prices . sulfur content already has come down drastically since 1994 from 300 parts per million , and an industry executive says getting the remaining " little buggers " out of there is n't worth the cost . environmental groups pushed for the move , as did the auto industry , which argued that the lower limit will put the us in line with japan and europe , reports the hill . automakers are big fans of the change because it will make it easier for them to meet emissions standards nationwide . the post quotes the leader of a clean-air group as saying the epa decision will end up being the biggest such move of president obama 's second term . " there is not another air pollution control strategy that we know of that will produce as substantial , cost-effective and expeditious emissions reductions . "
