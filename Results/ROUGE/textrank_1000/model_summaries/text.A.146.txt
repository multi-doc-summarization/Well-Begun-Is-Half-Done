the lawsuits may have only just begun : richard carpenter filed a suit in california wednesday on behalf of sister karen carpenter 's estate , saying record companies are cheating both of them out of digital royalties . richard , the surviving member of the sibling duo , accuses universal music group and a & m records of not giving the band its fair cut of digital sales of carpenters records , tmz reports . he says the carpenters , who recorded 11 albums and released 31 singles before karen 's death in 1983 , are owed at least $ 2 million , and he notes that the courts sided with eminem in a similar case in 2010 . the lawsuit accuses record companies of shortchanging the duo by undercounting digital downloads and " improperly classifying " downloads as record sales when they should be considered licensing , which has a higher royalty rate , variety reports . " the carpenters recordings are among the best sellers in the history of popular music and after 48 years continue to contribute a substantial amount to umg/a & m 's annual bottom line , " richard carpenter said in a statement . " it seems only fair that these companies account fairly to my sister 's estate and to me . i look forward to proving the allegations in court . "
