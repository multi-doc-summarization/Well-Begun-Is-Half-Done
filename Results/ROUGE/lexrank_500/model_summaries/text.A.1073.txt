academy of motion picture arts and sciences president cheryl boone isaacs is n't in a position to boycott the oscarsâ€”but she wants jada pinkett smith and spike lee to know that she is " heartbroken and frustrated " by this year 's lack of diversity and there are big changes ahead . " this is a difficult but important conversation , and it 's time for big changes , " she said in a statement monday night , per the hollywood reporter . " the academy is taking dramatic steps to alter the makeup of our membership , " she added , promising a " review of our membership recruitment in order to bring about much-needed diversity in our 2016 class and beyond . " smith and lee announced their boycott after the academy released an all-white acting nominee list for the second year in a row . boone isaacs noted that the academy worked hard to stay relevant by recruiting younger members in the '60s and '70s , and the goal now is " inclusion in all of its facets : gender , race , ethnicity , and sexual orientation . " insiders tell the wrap that academy governors and board members received an email monday asking them to make a push for more diversity in each branch of the organization . in its most recent report on the issue , ucla 's ralph j. bunche center for african-american studies found that senior management at movie studios is 92 % white and 83 % male , reports the los angeles times . if black stars stay away from the oscars , " the image of hollywood that the academy presents is at stake , " researcher ana-christina ramon tells the paper . ( the oscars were recently defended by one perhaps surprising person . )
