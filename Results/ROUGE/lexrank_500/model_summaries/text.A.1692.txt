more than 900 students were absent from orlando-area schools on thursday after authorities say a man on twitter threatened to shoot students and put pipe bombs inside campuses , per the ap . there were reportedly 379 absences at orange 's liberty middle school , 357 at orlando 's boone high school , 174 at orlando 's edgewater high school , and an undisclosed number at orlando 's colonial high school . the fbi said wednesday it was looking into the threats , but did n't think they were credible . authorities are searching for a 23-year-old transient named jesus henry kong ( aka jessie eloah calix and jesus matute ) they say is responsible . " although the fbi does not believe that the threat is credible , as the subject does not reside in florida , we will continue to work with local partners to locate the subject , " said an fbi special agent on wednesday , per the orlando sentinel . kong has lived in florida , california , virginia , and maryland .
