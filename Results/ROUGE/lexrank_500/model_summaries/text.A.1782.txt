the womb protects a developing fetus , but it might not be able to fend off air pollution . researchers have presented a small study suggesting for the first time that air pollutants can make their way from a pregnant woman 's lungs to her placenta , reports the guardian . because the placenta allows nutrients and oxygen to flow from the woman 's blood stream to her fetus , that means it could similarly allow pollutants into the womb as well , per cnn . " our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible , " says norrice liu , a pediatrician who led the research at queen mary university in london . " we also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby 's body to have an adverse effect , because if they have an effect on the placenta , this will have a direct impact on the fetus . " the study , presented at the european respiratory society international congress in paris , was indeed small , involving just five women . but researchers found " black sooty " particles , believed to be carbon , in the placentas of each one , says another of the researchers , lisa miyashita . further analysis is in the works to confirm , but the results mirror similar ones in animals . given previous research laying out the potential dangers that air pollution can cause to babies , the scientists say the study should factor into the advice given to pregnant women , even if it 's as simple as wearing a mask or avoiding especially busy roads when out and about . the good news : all five of the women gave birth to healthy babies . ( air pollution might be the world 's greatest killer . )
