apparently there are places even south park fears to tread . after getting a death threat from the jihadist website revolutionmuslim.com , the show pulled the prophet mohammed out of this week 's episode , bleeping out all mention of his name , putting “ censored ” banners over parts of the episode and , where necessary , replacing him with santa claus in a bear suit , the huffington post reports . here 's the deal : last week 's episode ( which you can see a clip of here ) mocked the taboo against showing the prophet mohammed , having him show up first hidden inside a u-haul , and then inside a bear costume . this week 's episode was to continue that story . it 's unclear whether the extra censorship is intended to appease the irony-challenged folks at revolutionmuslim or mock them . south park , incidentally , has tackled the issue before , and even depicted mohammed on screen once with impunity .
