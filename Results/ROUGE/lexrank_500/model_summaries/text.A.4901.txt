you 'd expect some jail time for a child rapist , right ? not so for du pont heir robert h. richards iv , who admitted to raping his 3-year-old daughter almost a decade ago , the daily mail reports . in a 2009 case that 's only now coming to light , the news journal reports that delaware judge jan jurden sentenced richards to an eight-year prison term but suspended it for probation , plus a sex offenders rehabilitation program , because richards " will not fare well " in prison and " treatment needs exceed need for punishment . " the news journal calls it " a rare and puzzling rationale " from a judge who is known for her tough sentencing , especially given that treatment is usually reserved for first-time drug offenders , drunk drivers , and the mentally ill . while some attorneys say such a sentence is n't unheard of , a public defender notes that the case raises questions about " how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system . " a defense lawyer adds , " i 've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well ... who thrives in jail ? " a suit recently filed against richards by his ex-wife is seeking damages for assaults on the couple 's two children . initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape , richards took a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape , which carries no mandatory minimum prison sentence , the daily mail notes .
