" a shame that production set her up to fail , " rep nicole perna concludes . carey 's manager stella bulochnikov tells billboard stage managers were alerted that the " in-ears " were n't working four minutes before showtime ; reassurances the ear pieces would function once live were bogus so carey " pulled them out but could not hear the music over the crowd . " bulochnikov suggests production " just want [ ed ] eyeballs at any expense . " dick clark productions swung back in a statement released to the ap sunday night : " to suggest that dcp ( dick clark productions ) ... would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory , outrageous , and frankly absurd . " it said its initial investigation found no evidence of technical errors . an unnamed production source counters perna 's rehearsal claims , saying carey used a body double during saturday 's rehearsal . ( josh groban tweeted , then deleted , a diss about carey . )
