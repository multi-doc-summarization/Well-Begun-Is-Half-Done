viewers of russian state tv recently learned about a 3-year-old boy nailed to a board by ukrainian officials in front of his mother ; it was " just like jesus , " the report said . afterward , the mother , who was said to have committed a crime , was reportedly dragged around a central square in slovyansk behind a tank . it 's a story that would shock any viewer , but the thing is : there 's no indication that it actually happened , russian opposition leaders say , per the daily beast . they suggest the story was made up to stir anti-ukraine sentiment . russia 's most popular tv station cited just one witness , and opposition figure boris nemtsov is calling the story " dangerously false . " a wall street journal reporter did some investigating of his own : " i spoke with dozens of people , but strangely , none of them mentioned anything about the crucifixion of a 3-year-old boy , " alan cullison noted , according to the moscow times . a russian journalist 's video comes to a similar conclusion , the times reports . but " on seeing the horrors of such inhuman torture , an ordinary viewer would have only one intention : to join the volunteer forces and â€˜ seek revenge against the ukrainian fascists , ' " nemtsov posted on facebook .
