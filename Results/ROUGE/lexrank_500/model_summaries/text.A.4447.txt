in a scheme clearly devised to give brick-and-mortar retailers nightmares , amazon is running a one-day promotion on dec. 10 in which customers can score up to $ 15 in discounts for literally walking out of stores . here 's how it works : download the amazon price check app for your iphone or android device , walk into the retailer of your choice on saturday with the geo-location feature on , scan three things you 'd like to buy , and leave . then , anytime within the next 24 hours you can buy all three from amazon at 5 % off , to a maximum of $ 5 each . that might not sound like much , but as intomobile points out , amazon 's prices are usually lower anyway , so that discount is something of a bonus . plus , chris velazco of techcrunch notes , it allows customers to see a product in person before buyingâ€”something you ca n't usually do on amazon .
