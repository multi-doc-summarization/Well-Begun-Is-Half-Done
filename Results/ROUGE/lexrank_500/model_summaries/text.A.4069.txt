" this association remains significant , even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and poor mental health . " optimists were found to have better total cholesterol levels , blood sugar levels , and body-mass indexes , and to get more physical activity . " it 's an incentive to try to be optimistic , " cbs new york quotes a physician as saying . that 's " oftentimes difficult in the times we live in , in the world we live in and the sad news all the time , " the physician goes on . " but if you knew that you could actually save your life , i think that â€™ s a pretty good prescription . " published in health behavior and policy review , the paper looks at 11 years of data on people aged 45 to 84 across six us regions . they were assessed every 18 months to two years by seven health metrics ( including blood pressure , bmi , and dietary intake ) and filled out surveys about their optimism and physical and mental health . it 's likely the first study linking heart health and optimism in the general population , although a 2012 harvard study did connect overall happiness with cardiovascular health , the new york times reported at the time . ( another study finds that those who feel younger than their age will live longer . )
