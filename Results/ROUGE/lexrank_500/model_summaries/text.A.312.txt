president trump said thursday that he 's ready to send the us military to the border to keep a caravan of mostly honduran migrants out . in a series of tweets , trump also reiterated threats to withhold financial aid to central american nations , with particular attention to mexico . " i must , in the strongest of terms , ask mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so i will call up the u.s. military and close our southern border ! " the president wrote . he said border security surpassed any other issue in importance for him , including trade and the newly reformulated nafta pact known as usmca . trump also asserted that the caravan of immigrants includes " many criminals . " the washington post suggests that trump is especially irked because more immigrant parents than ever are reaching the border with children since the us stopped its policy of family separations over the summer . border patrol arrested nearly 17,000 family members in september , a record number that 's up 80 % from july . trump has previously said he wants to beef up the military 's presence along the border until a wall is in place , and he again faulted democrats on the issue of immigration . " all democrats fault for weak laws ! " he wrote . but comments this week from nancy pelosi suggest her party wo n't be budging on the solution he wants most . " it happens to be like a manhood issue for the president , building a wall , and i 'm not interested in that , ” she said , per roll call .
