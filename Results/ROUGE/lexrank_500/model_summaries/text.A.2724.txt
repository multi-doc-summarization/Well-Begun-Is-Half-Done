you are what you reek ? it turns out that we can tell a lot about someone 's personality just by their smell , according to the new york daily news . sixty people in poland wore the same t-shirt for three nights , and did not use soap , smoke , drink , or " eat odorous foods " during the study . those shirts were then sniffed by 200 lucky volunteers , who were asked to judge the smells based on five personality traits , such as extroversion , neuroticism , and dominance . the results were n't perfect , but the smellers ' predictions about extroversion and neuroticism were about as accurate as those of raters who made their judgments after watching a video . myhealthnewsdaily notes that the smell-testers did especially well in detecting dominance in members of the opposite sex .
