back in 2006 , a study that went on to gain prominence found that 18-month-olds were willing to be helpful even without being prompted . many assumed this was evidence of innate altruism , but new research out of stanford and published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests that these kids were actually primed by the playful researchers , if subtly , to display generosityâ€”which means that altruistic behavior may be dictated by our experiences , however brief , instead of mere instinct , reports stanford news . " people often call something 'innate ' because they do n't understand the kinds of subtle experiences that can make something , like altruism , flourish , " says the lead author , admitting that " the findings will stir up some controversy , but in a good way . " to investigate the effect of the original study 's priming , researchers mimicked it with a group of 34 toddlers , rolling a ball back and forth with the child while chatting , then knocking over an object to see if the child would pick it up . they split the group in two ; in the second group , the adult and child played with their own ball independently while talking . turns out the kids who played with the adult were three times as likely to help out and pick up the dropped object . " kids are always on the lookout for social cues , and this is a very prominent one , " says another researcher . " does the person 's play indicate that they 'll care for me ? these actions communicate a mutuality , and the child responds in kind . " to foster altruism at home , the researchers suggest , model it , reports yahoo . ( altruism has been linked to a specific gene . )
