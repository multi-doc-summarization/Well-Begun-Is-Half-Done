dr. christopher s. driskill , one of the few ob/gyns in hobbs , new mexico , was appreciated by many of his patients and admired by his colleagues . but the new york times reports that driskill now faces serious allegations , from drinking on the job to failing to show up at a delivery because he was sleeping with another patient at the time , and his license has been suspended as a result . the new mexico medical board confronted driskill with the accusations , which also include neglecting other patients who were in labor and writing " inappropriate notations of a personal nature into certain patient medical charts , " but as of last week , the prosecutor for the board reached an agreement with driskill that could allow him to start practicing again if it 's approved by the board next month . the drama has been the talk of the townâ€”and beyond . cosmopolitan theorized in a headline , " this might be the worst doctor ever , " and britain 's daily mail , not surprisingly , covered the salacious story from a continent away . the story " had me wondering if he was drunk on the job when he did my three kids , " says one hobbs resident . the trouble started when driskill , 42 , who is married with four kids , was fired from premier ob/gyn in august for allegedly being intoxicated while working and keeping a " personal cache of alcohol " in his office , as well as allegedly sleeping with patients . but the claims seem strange to people like dr. jose garcia , a pediatrician who 's worked closely with driskill and who says he 's a " health nut " whom garcia has never seen drink at social gatherings . no criminal charges have been filed .
