previous studies have documented that scarfing down peanuts or nuts every day can lead to better cardiovascular health . but now research is suggesting that eating peanuts and tree nuts like almonds , cashews , and walnuts are linked to lower mortality rates , per a maastricht university press release . the study , published online today in the international journal of epidemiology , found that both men and women who ate at least 10 grams of peanuts or nuts daily saw a reduced risk of dying from not only heart disease , but also from respiratory illnesses , cancer , diabetes , and neurodegenerative diseases . the only disappointing result , expressed in the saddest sentence you may read all week : " [ the study ] finds no protective effect for peanut butter . " the press release notes that the health benefits of peanuts and nuts are probably due to what they 're harboring inside their shells : an amalgam of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats ( the so-called " good " fats ) , fiber , antioxidants , vitamins , and other compounds . and it 's not like you have to go overboard in your nut-eating habits : researchers in the maastricht university study found that eating more than an average 15 grams per day—or half a handful—did n't confer any lower mortality risk . so what gives with peanut butter , which ostensibly contains those same ingredients ? researchers speculate it 's all the other stuff peanut butter has added , such as salt and vegetable oils , that may prevent the tasty spread from being more healthful . ( peanut butter may be able to help in the fight against alzheimer 's . )
