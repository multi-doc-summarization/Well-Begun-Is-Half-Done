a journal called aggressive behavior has published research disputing the widely-held theory that boys will beat you up , whereas girls will talk behind your back . actually , the study suggests , boys do both : in scientific terms , they are both " physically " and " relationally " more aggressive than girls . the study followed 620 students of both sexes through middle school and high school in six georgia districts , time reports . results came from regular surveys asking students about their behavior over the past 30 days . unfortunately , " almost all of the students surveyed , 96 % , had passed a rumor or made a nasty comment about someone over the course of the seven-year study , " a researcher says . but physical and relational aggression were both more common in boys . middle school , the study says , is the worst for meanness both physical and relational : it 's most common between sixth and eighth grade . but middle schoolers can look forward to high school , when it begins dropping toward a senior-year low . the researchers are n't the first to point to boys ' emotional cruelty , the new york times reports : the author of the book on which the movie mean girls is based wrote a sequel focusing on boys . " the reality is that most boys â€™ days are filled with many of the same social challenges that girls face , and what they learn from those experiences matters now and for their futures , as it does for girls , " writes rosalind wiseman . ( that advice could be handy for this family , whose first 12 kids were boys . )
