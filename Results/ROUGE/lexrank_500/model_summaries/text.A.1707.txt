big news in the fight against hiv : kaiser permanente , san francisco 's biggest private insurer , says that over a 32-month period , not a single one of its clients taking truvada contracted hiv . truvada is the name of the daily pre-exposure prophylaxis , or prep , pill that the cdc recommended for use in at-risk populations earlier this year . the new study followed 657 san franciscans ( all but four of them gay men ) who asked their doctors for truvada , and found that while condom use did decline—a major fear of prep critics—no one contracted hiv between mid-2012 and february of this year , the new york times reports . more than 40 % of the subjects said they used fewer condoms after starting truvada , the san francisco chronicle reports , and while half of the subjects got syphilis , gonorrhea , or chlamydia within a year of starting prep , the times notes most sexual infections other than hiv can be cured with antibiotics . and rates of those infections were already climbing among gay men before prep came on the market , a doctor notes . this was an observational study of the $ 50-a-month drug ; a clinical trial last year actually gave some participants a placebo instead of truvada . that study , however , was stopped early—because it became so obvious that truvada worked that it was unethical to keep some of the subjects on a placebo . this new study " takes it out of the realm of clinical trials and into the real world , " one doctor and infectious disease expert says . an aids activist echoes that , noting the study " fills in a critical gap by showing that prep can prevent infections in a real-world public health program . " " this is very reassuring data , " adds the lead author of the new study . " it tells us that prep works even in a high-risk population . " according to abc 7 , the study population also included " injection drug users . "
