" this is supposed to last for eternity , " says the operator of the so-called doomsday vault , which since 2008 has been tucked within a mountain on a norwegian island 800 miles from the north pole where the soil is always frozen—or is supposed to be . the guardian reports the global seed vault " has been breached , " with meltwater pouring into its entrance . this though reuters in 2015 reported that the location on the island of spitsbergen was supposed to be so cold that in the event of power failure the nearly 1 million packets of crop seeds within the vault would be preserved for at least 200 years . the issue now is skyrocketing temperatures ( roughly 45 degrees above normal in late 2016 ) that replaced light snow with rain and melting , and their effect on the permafrost that surrounds the vault . " it was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there , " explains norwegian government rep hege njaa aschim . also not in the plans : watching the vault 24/7 , as they are doing now . but now all the reasons not to panic : that water did n't make it to the vault , and new waterproofing work is underway . one of the vault 's creators ( who was n't present during the incident ) tells popular science " in my experience , there ’ s been water intrusion at the front of the tunnel every single year . " he explains the protective mechanics of the path to the seeds : a 330-foot tunnel , two pumping stations , and a brief uphill slant before the vault , whose 0.4-degree fahrenheit temperature would freeze any water that made it that far . ( the vault saw its first withdrawal in 2015 . )
