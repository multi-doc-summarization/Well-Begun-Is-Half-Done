one lucky new york family sold a tiny chinese bowl this week for $ 2,224,997 more than they paid for it : $ 3 , at a garage sale six years ago . the bowl , which measures roughly 5.5 inches in diameter , sat in the unnamed family 's home for years ; eventually , a quest to see what it was worth took them to sotheby 's , which identified it as a " ding " bowl from the 10th or 11th century . making their windfall even sweeter : sotheby 's had anticipated it would sell for up to $ 300,000 , reports the new york post . it 's one of only two known bowls of its kind . ( and it 's not the only great buy in the news : a cottage purchased in 2007 was found to contain $ 30 million worth of art . )
