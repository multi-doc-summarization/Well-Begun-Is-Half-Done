" this is for pearl harbor , " one less-than-subtle user tweeted along with a photo of carli lloyd 's face on an atomic bomb . " they destroyed pearl harbor , we destroyed their dreams , " tweeted another . yet another wrote " usa has blown japan away , " while referencing hiroshima and nagasaki . the new york daily news reports 120,000 died instantly when two atomic bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 ; while 2,403 died in the attack on pearl harbor . pearl harbor tends to get mentioned about 500 times a day on twitter , analytics website topsy finds , per nbc news . that number jumped to 50,000 yesterday , but at least some users challenged the trend . " pearl harbor is n't funny . hiroshima is n't funny . nagasaki is n't funny . this is n't ww2 this is a women 's soccer match in 2015 , " wrote a user .
