the stat is remarkable : every three hours in the us , a child swallows a battery and risks potentially lethal consequences , per the washington post . now , however , a clever fix is in sight , thanks to origami . mit researchers have unveiled a tiny robot that , once ingested , unfolds inside the body to retrieve batteries or other foreign objects . they 've demonstrated how it works in a synthetic stomach , with tests on live animals on deck . research on the device is still in the early stages , but it could theoretically be used to patch wounds inside the stomach as well , the scientists say in a press release . " it 's really exciting to see our small origami robots doing something with potential important applications to health care , " says mit 's daniela rus . the post notes that the robot 's structural material had to be highly safe , meaning " sharp chips " were out . " we spent a lot of time at asian markets and the chinatown market looking for materials , " says one researcher , and they ended up going with dried pig intestine . ( the verge wonders about a vegan version . ) the robot is encapsulated in ice ; upon being swallowed and melting , it opens up to move along like an " inch-worm , " explains cnet . scientists are able to control its movement via magnetic fields , and it can " swim " in the stomach 's fluidsâ€” " 20 % of [ its ] forward motion is by propelling water , " per the release . in the demonstration , the robot 's attached magnet allowed it to latch onto a battery and remove it . ( the concept of origami holds the promise of creating inexpensive robots . )
