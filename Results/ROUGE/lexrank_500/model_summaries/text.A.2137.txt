just what did ron paul mean when he finished third in iowa and said , " we are all austrians now " ? republican candidates do n't often celebrate european economic policies , but this is different , matthew yglesias writes in slate . those familiar with the inside baseball of libertarianism know that paul is referring to two thinkers , ludwig von mises and murray rothbard , whose idea of capitalism " is even more libertarian and anarchic than that espoused by many libertarians , " writes yglesias . " austrian economics " rejects all government regulation and intervention to help the poor , and considers the tweaking of short-term interest rates a mistake that lures investors into doomed enterprises . yglesias mounts a counter-argument , noting that the " austrian " view does n't explain the effectiveness of post-great depression fixes or the spending habits that fuel recessions . yglesias sees an economic recovery around the corner , but if there is n't one , " these faddish views may gain more steam and perhaps we really all will be austrians someday soon . but let â€™ s hope not .
