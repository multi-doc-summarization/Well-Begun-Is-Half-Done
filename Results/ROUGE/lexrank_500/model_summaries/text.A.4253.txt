it seems applying to join isis is n't so different from applying to be a subway sandwich artist . nbc news reports thousands of what appear to be isis recruiting forms were leaked to various news agencies by a " disillusioned " member of the terror organization . cnn has the full list of 23 questions from the forms . those questions include normal job application queries ( education level , current employer , and recommendations ) as well as some questions not likely to be asked by your local hr departmentâ€”religious level , previous jihad experience , obedience level , and preference for becoming a fighter or suicide attacker . of more use to intelligence agencies around the world , the leaked documents include the names , addresses , phone numbers , and travel routes of isis members , sky news reports . the names not already known by officials include isis members in the middle east and beyond , including the us and canada . officials believe this information could be key in preventing future terror attacks . the documents , which include a file marked " martyrs , " also shed light on the mindset of people hoping to become suicide attackers . one applicant wrote he was interested in a suicide mission because " i have a headache because ( of ) shrapnel in my head .
