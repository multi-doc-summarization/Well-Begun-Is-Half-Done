alaska 's legislature did n't move to expand medicaid , so gov . bill walker is doing it on his own . walker says he plans to accept $ 146 million in federal funds that his state has access to under the affordable care act in order to cover some 42,000 residents who qualify under the program , reuters and the new york times report . walker , who is just seven months into his term , had made expanding medicaid a campaign priority . " this is the final option for me , " he says . the legislative budget and audit committee will now have 45 days to act before walker accepts the funds ; he says he can proceed regardless of how the committee responds . the federal government will take on the full cost of the expansion at first , then shave its cut to 90 % by 2020 . some 28 other states have expanded medicaid under the law , but just kentucky , west virginia , and ohio did so without legislative consent . walker , who calls the move a " common-sense decision , " says his bills seeking expansion approval were all blocked by republicans worried about the tab alaska would have to pick up in the future . " regardless of federal funding , we can not afford the medicaid system we have now , " says republican state sen. pete kelly . " our current system is broken . " walker hopes to begin enrollment in september and have 20,000 signed up within one year . the wall street journal observes that the move will " bring the number of states opting into the law 's expansion close to 30 and make it more likely other states would follow .
