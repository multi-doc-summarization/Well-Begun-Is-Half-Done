natasha exelby lived out every news anchor 's nightmare on live tv over the weekend , and to add to that nightmare , some are saying she 's been sanctioned for it , per the new york daily news . a video circulating online shows the aussie journalist on abc24 on sunday , zoning out and staring at a pen while waiting for a prerecorded portion of the show to end , not knowing at first the camera had cut back to her , per the new york post . once exelby realized she was back on the air , she let out a startled gasp , but quickly composed herself and continued with the broadcast . news outlets reported exelby , a freelance journalist , was yanked from on-air segments for abc , with some even framing it as a firing . but abc 's news director insists that 's not true and that " slip-ups will happen . " " our presenters are humans , not robots , " he says , adding exelby is simply an occasional contributor ( not a full-time employee ) who only does on-air segments as needed , even though at the moment she has n't been rescheduled to do more on-air bits , per the guardian ( which cites sources saying exelby had been " read the riot act " by management ) . the australian notes she 's been hired to temporarily read the morning news for a sydney radio station while the regular host is on break . exelby , who had supporters such as russell crowe rushing to her defense , thanked everyone on twitter , adding , " not my finest hour . myself and my mesmerising pen honourably salute you ! " ( this news anchor reported on horrible news that hit too close to home . )
