the aug. 14 execution of carey dean moore in nebraska garnered national attention because authorities used a heretofore untested cocktail of four drugs to end the life of the convicted killer . but now , another aspect of the execution is attracting attention : the fact that authorities at nebraska state penitentiary closed curtains for some 14 minutes , preventing observers from seeing the execution from start to finish . according to observers , about 15 minutes after authorities began to administer the drugs to moore via iv , corrections director scott frakes—in the same room as moore—spoke into his radio and the curtains closed the lincoln journal star reports . some say closing the curtains " hindered transparency " because observers—and , by proxy , other states looking for new execution methods—were not able to see the full effect of the drug combination . " speculation can not help but be rife , state sen. ernie chambers , a death penalty opponent , wrote to frakes days after the arrest , saying that witness reports of the events before the curtains closed " only tantalized . " those reports include accounts of moore 's face turning red , and then purple , the omaha world-herald reports , as well as moore taking rapid , heaving breaths and coughing , per the journal star . however , a corrections spokeswoman says the curtain closing was n't unplanned , telling the journal star that it " is consistent with past practice . frakes says the execution was performed with " respect for the process and dignity for all involved , " per the world-herald .
