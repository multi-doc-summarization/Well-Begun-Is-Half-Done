neuroscientists working with rats have pulled off a feat raising hopes that paralyzed people might someday be able to regain control of their bladders and ditch the catheter . the scientists grafted nerves from elsewhere in the rats ' bodies to their severed spinal cords , and the rats eventually were able to pee again almost as well as healthy rats , reports science news . the rats were not able to walk again , and while they did n't regain full control of their bladders , the study is still " an astonishing breakthrough for the field , " writes liat clark at wired . any similar research on humans is still years away because the results must first be replicated on animals bigger than rats , reports the bbc . previous attempts to regenerate nerves on damaged spinal cords were stymied by scar tissue at the site of the original injury . the scientists were able to overcome that by using an enzyme to break down the scar tissue , in tandem with a growth factor that helped the transplanted nerves grow . " this is one of the most important steps that i have seen in recent years , ‚Äù says an oslo neuroscientist not involved with the study .
