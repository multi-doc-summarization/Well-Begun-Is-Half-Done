the can has been kicked a little farther down the road . when president trump in october approved the release of previously classified or redacted documents on the jfk assassination , he blocked the release of others over national security concerns and gave federal agencies 180 days to re-review the withheld documents . the review in some cases turned up " identifiable national security , law enforcement , and foreign affairs concerns , " per a memo written by trump , who on thursday said some files would now be kept under wraps until oct. 26 , 2021 . he wrote that some files are " of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure , " per the ap , but he ordered that they be reviewed over the next three years , and that any that can be released be made public immediately . the dallas morning news reports roughly 19,000 documents were released thursday by the national archivesâ€”the largest batch thus far , notes the hill ; 520 remain fully sealed . in his memo , trump included a hopeful note for the curious : " the need for continued protection can only grow weaker with the passage of time from this congressional finding . " ( some were hoping files would be released this week that would shed light on a 1971 suicide . )
