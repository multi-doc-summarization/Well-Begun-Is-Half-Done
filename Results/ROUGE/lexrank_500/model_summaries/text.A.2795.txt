let it be said that tom hardy is a man of his word . a 2016 esquire uk profile opened with an anecdote about how he had to add a fresh tattoo to his tattoo-heavy body because of a bet he made and lost with leonardo dicaprio . his revenant co-star thought hardy would walk away with an oscar nomination , hardy disagreed , to his eventual peril . he got the nom , lost the bet , and had to get a tattoo of dicaprio 's design . and as mtv news reports , there 's now photo proof that he did . in the esquire interview , hardy hinted at the eventual inking , saying , " he wrote , in this really sh -- ty handwriting : 'leo knows everything . ' ha ! i was like , 'ok , i 'll get it done , but you have to write it properly . ' " but , he added , " i have n't got it yet because it sucks . " that 's apparently changed , as evidenced by a photo posted to instagram of hardy posing with a photographer in san francisco . on hardy 's right bicep you can make out the words " leo knows all . "
