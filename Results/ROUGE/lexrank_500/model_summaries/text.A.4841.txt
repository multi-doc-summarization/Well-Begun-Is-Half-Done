extended family butting in with opinions about your kids is nothing newâ€”but this case in vietnam is a wild exception . cnn reports that a vietnamese couple had their 2-year-old twins genetically tested after family members kept harping about how different the children looked . what the center for genetic analysis and technologies in hanoi discovered : the twins are bi-paternal , meaning they share only a mother . the revelations about the family pretty much end there . the twins ' gender was not revealed , and the only identifying details given by vietnam 's state-run news agency vns is that the children have very different hair ( thick and wavy vs. thin and straight ) and live in hoa binh province with their 34-year-old father and mother , whose age was n't given . le dinh luong , president of the genetic association of vietnam , says he 's unaware of any case like this in his country . that has n't stopped paranoid fathers from phoning the hanoi center over fears about their twins , reports the tuoi tre paper . it 's rare , but certainly not unheard of in the us . last year , a new jersey judge ruled a man is father to one twin while another man is father to the other , in a case that had child-support implications . the judge in that case cited two other similar court cases , and a 1997 article by identity testing expert karl-hans wurzinger , who testified in the case , put the number of reported paternity cases involving superfecundation ( the fathering of fraternal twins by two males ) at one in every 13,000 . cnn reports that the lifespan of the egg and sperm allow for roughly a week-long period in which a woman could become pregnant through two acts of intercourse . ( this man 's son was " fathered " by his unborn twin . )
