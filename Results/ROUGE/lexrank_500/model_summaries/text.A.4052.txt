a money manager who catered to high-profile celebrities and wealthy new yorkers has been charged with running a $ 30 million ponzi scheme . the client list of kenneth starr ( no , not that kenneth starr ) includes uma thurman and martin scorsese , reports reuters . no details on exactly who lost what , but starr made enough to afford a $ 7.5 million manhattan apartment . the indictment does n't name names of possible victims , but it recounts " an actress " storming into starr 's office to demand to know where $ 1 million of her money went . jacob bernstein of the daily beast identifies her as thurman . she reportedly did get her money back , though it came not from starr but , in classic ponzi fashion , another client . that unlucky guy was jim wiatt , the former head of william morris , writes bernstein .
