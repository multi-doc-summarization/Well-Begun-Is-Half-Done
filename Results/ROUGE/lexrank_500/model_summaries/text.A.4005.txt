somebody who bought a powerball ticket in massachusetts has scored the biggest solo jackpot in american history . but state lottery officials have a major correction : it turns out , the winning ticket for $ 759 million was sold at a store in chicopee , not watertown as originally announced , reports the ap . " human error , plain and simple , " says the state lottery 's executive director , michael sweeney . the store in watertown did sell a ticket worth $ 1 million , perhaps playing a role in the confusion , but the much bigger winner picked up the lucky ticket at the pride station & store across the state . the numbers that won a jackpot were 6 , 7 , 16 , 23 , 26 and the powerball was 4 . the only bigger lottery jackpot in us history was 2016 's $ 1.6 billion prize , but that was split three ways . the store owner in chicopee will get $ 50,000 for selling the winning ticket , reports cbs boston . the store owner in watertown will have to settle for $ 10,000 for selling the $ 1 million ticket . of note : the $ 758.7 million is the figure for the annuity option , which is paid over 29 years . if the winner wants it all now , he or she will receive $ 443.3 million , minus more than 30 % to cover state and federal taxes .
