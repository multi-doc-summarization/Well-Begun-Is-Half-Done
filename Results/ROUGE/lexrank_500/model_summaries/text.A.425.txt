the nypd has made its largest gun bust in recent memory , seizing 254 firearms in a 10-month operation . the guns were smuggled from north and south carolina into new york city by two gunrunners , who hid the weapons in luggage on discount buses , then purchased by an undercover cop pretending to be a gun broker across a number of transactions , the ap reports . the alleged smugglers , walter walker , 29 , and earl campbell , 24 , and 17 others—including matthew best , an up-and-coming rapper from brooklyn—have been arrested . best 's involvement is an interesting one : authorities stumbled on the gun smuggling operation during a drug investigation , after the rapper posted instagram photos of handguns and cash . turns out , best was helping walker sell his guns , the new york post reports . walker and campbell bought the guns both on the black market and through gun dealers , and would then stuff a dozen or more into bags and courier them on cheap chinatown-based bus services , the ap reports . on one occasion , authorities say , campbell brought along his girlfriend , who carried a deconstructed assault rifle in her zebra-striped suitcase . she then tried to reassemble the gun by looking up a youtube instructional video on her phone , but could n't put it back together . the undercover officer bought it for $ 1,100 anyway .
