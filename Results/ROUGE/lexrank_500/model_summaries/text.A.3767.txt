if you 're a big fan of wine and would like to be surrounded by apparently like-minded people , consider moving to vatican city . despite its small size , or perhaps because of it , it manages to consume more wine per capita than any other country , according to the wine institute . how much exactly ? at 74 liters of wine per person , double italy 's consumption , religion news service reports—and in terms of major countries , italy is one of the top two wine consumers . that amount translates to about 105 bottles of wine per resident per year , the independent notes . and no , this does n't hinge around all that communion wine . as local media have pointed out , the number is probably so high because vatican residents are , in general , older , male , and highly educated , and they eat communal meals . all of those factors tend to increase wine consumption . and with a population of just 800 , those numbers are easily skewed by outliers . oh yeah , and then there 's the fact that just one store sells wine in the vatican—and the wine is practically tax-free .
