syria descending into civil war , the arab spring , instability in egyptâ€”the middle east is full of uncertainties that threaten israel , but all of them are " dwarfed " by iran 's nuclear threat , said israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu last night , reports reuters . netanyahu 's comments were broadcast live by israel 's media , and published in both right- and left-wing newspapers , as debate grows in israel over whether the country needs to go to war with iran . " i say again that iran must not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons , " netanyahu said . pressure is building in israel to take action , especially with yesterday 's disclosure that a new intelligence report presented to president obama shows that iran 's nuclear program has made developments " far beyond the scope known " by un inspectors , according to the left-leaning newspaper haaretz . washington officials would not comment on whether such a report even exists , but they maintain that iran is undecided about its nuclear weapons program and remains years away from having nuclear capability . some analysts think netanyahu 's talk is posturing designed to keep the pressure on for sanctions against iran , while others see it largely as a domestic political strategy .
