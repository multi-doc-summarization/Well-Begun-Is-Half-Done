halle berry and gabriel aubry have long stood as models of how not to treat the person with whom you 're co-parenting a child ( see : brawl , citizen 's arrest , insane child support ) , but they 've taken their bickering over daughter nahla to a new low : as tmz reports , berry hauled aubry back into court on monday , and the subject of contention was nahla 's hair , which berry claims aubry has been straightening and lightening in an apparent attempt to make the 6-year-old look less african american . ( aubry is white and berry is biracial , notes e ! online ) . the judge ruled that neither parent can alter nahla 's hair . berry identifies both herself and her daughter as black , notes the la times , saying in a 2011 interview that " i feel like she 's black . i 'm black and i 'm her mother . " berry last month sought to reduce her child support payments to aubry , adds the times ; she currently pays $ 16,000 a month and reportedly wants it cut to less than $ 4,000 to prompt the unemployed model to get a job .
