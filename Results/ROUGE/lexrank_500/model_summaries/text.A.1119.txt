the man behind a " revenge porn " site—which encouraged people to post naked photos of their exes to get back at them—allegedly obtained his nude content a second way : via a hacker who grabbed photos from personal email accounts . fbi agents yesterday arrested hunter moore , who ran the now-defunct isanyoneup.com ; he was charged with conspiracy , hacking , and identity theft . ( in case his name sounds familiar , nbc news notes his site once earned moore the title of the " most-hated man on the internet . " ) charles evens , the man who allegedly did the dirty work , was similarly arrested and charged . wired reports the two allegedly began emailing about the idea in late 2011 . evens allegedly sent moore an email asking for $ 250 for nude pictures of " 6 guys and 6 girls " in december of that year ; a month later , moore allegedly replied with , " hack all week for me . " prosecutors say the hacking ended may 2 , 2012 . the two face up to 7 years in prison . wired shares this 2012 quote , from moore to a woman whose picture reportedly appeared on his site : " i do n't know how you can point a finger at me ; you took the picture . i 'm sure you 're smart and go to school . i mean , it 's 2012 , what do you expect to happen ? somebody 's going to monetize this and i was the person to do it .
