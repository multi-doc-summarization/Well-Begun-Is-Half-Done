just days ago , a boat washed ashore in northern japan . aboard were eight men who said they were from north korea . now , another boat has been found just 45 miles north of the first , and it also held eightâ€”except all are dead . the 23-foot wooden " ghost ship " was discovered sunday on a beach near oga . it had no navigational devices and had lost a rotor blade . some aboard had been " reduced to bones , " and kyodo news reports that the coast guard suspects it originated in north korea , which sits about 450 miles away . sky news reports foreign ships are n't an uncommon occurrence in japan : 44 have washed ashore this year ; 66 did so in 2016 . the bbc presents a theory as to why : some believe north korea has been calling for more seafood to be fished in order to feed a hungry population . the increased demand may be leading its citizens to take boats that are in subpar condition far off its shores . and as a professor with japan 's tokai university tells sky news , the sea of japan " starts to get choppy when november comes . it gets dangerous when northwesterly winds start to blow . " kyodo notes the boat that carried the eight live men has vanished ; police are reviewing both cases . ( this ghost ship was found gutted by fire . )
