roy moore 's who is america ? segment aired on sunday night 's episode of the showtime series , and it featured the former alabama chief justice and failed us senate candidate storming off the set after supposedly failing a " pedophile detector test , " al.com reports . sacha baron cohen 's israeli anti-terrorism expert character , col. erran morad , told moore—who has been accused of molesting teen girls—about the newly developed test that detects a hormone from a pedophile 's sweat . when waved in front of " morad " and another man on set , the device did n't go off , but when waved in front of moore , it beeped every time . " i 've been married for 33 years , i 've never had an accusation of such things , " moore said . " if this is an instrument , then it 's certainly ... i 'm not a pedophile , ok ? maybe israeli technology has n't developed properly . " moore released a statement in early july explaining he agreed to the baron cohen interview because he thought he was receiving " an award for my strong support of israel " ; he said he 'd sue if the episode aired . " i do n't need sacha cohen to tell me who america is , " the statement adds . " as an american , i would never hide my identity and deceive others only to mock and ridicule them . " meanwhile , " morad " posted on twitter he " was honored that ladies man roi moore took time away from his busy schedule of hanging round shopping malls to talk to me . " vulture ranks the segments in this episode from least to most damning : rappers ness lee and bone crusher , moore , ex-member of the south carolina house of representatives chip limehouse , and three " old white conservatives " baron cohen duped into thinking they were being trained to " bait and then trap undocumented immigrants .
