california has joined the ranks of states that allow illegal immigrants to legally drive . " when a million people without their documents drive legally with respect to the state of california , the rest of this country will have to stand up and take notice , " said gov . jerry brown at yesterday 's signing , reports the los angeles times . some 1.4 million immigrants are likely to apply within three years ; the state may set up six temporary issuing offices . the law suggests calling the documents " driving privileges " rather than " driver 's licenses , " but discrimination over the distinction is banned , the ap notes . the bill was backed by police because drivers " will be more likely to have been tested , to have insurance , or to know the rules of the road , " says lapd chief charlie beck . but a note of caution comes from new mexico , one of 10 states that already issues such licenses . " it 's been a disaster , " says the state 's secretary for taxation and revenue . " we have had a lot of identity fraud . "
