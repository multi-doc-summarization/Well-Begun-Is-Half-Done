it 's been nearly a week since an " apocalyptic " bridge collapse in italy , and the death toll has climbed for perhaps the last time . reuters reports the bodies of three family members—the last three people believed missing—were pulled from a crushed car over the weekend in the rubble of genoa 's morandi bridge , bringing the count of people killed in tuesday 's catastrophe to 43 . via the washington post , the ansa news agency reports the family , which included a child , had been headed on vacation . nine people remain hospitalized , four of them critically , per genoa 's prefecture . a fire brigade official says the wreckage will continue to be searched to be doubly sure there is n't anyone they missed , though rescuers believe everyone who was on the bridge has been accounted for . the bbc reports that italian president sergio mattarella and prime minister giuseppe conte presided over a state funeral for nearly 20 of the victims over the weekend , though some families rejected the public overtures , either wanting to mourn privately or because they were fuming at the government for the tragedy . " we do not want farcical ceremonies , " one family member told a local newspaper . " our children are not a tool for public parades . " meanwhile , via the independent , a 1979 report has emerged from the bridge 's engineer that warned about deterioration risks . riccardo morandi noted the salty ocean air and pollution from a neighboring factory had led to a " well-known loss of superficial chemical resistance of the concrete , " and that the bridge would need constant upkeep to get rid of rust and other vulnerabilities . the cause of the collapse is still under investigation .
