hoping scientists will find a brilliant alternative to oil and coal ? how about a thermonuclear reactor that will hit temperatures ten times hotter than the sun and " could solve the world 's energy problems for the next thirty million years , " writes raffi khatchadourian in the new yorker . the project—called the international thermonuclear experimental reactor , in france—only needs to overcome rock-bottom morale , constant delays , tensions between engineers around the world , grumbling politicians , and a multi-billion-dollar budget that 's never quite high enough . " there is a lot of anxiety here that it is all going to implode , " says a physicist . scientists have long dreamed of such a reactor to harness power by nuclear fusion , a cleaner process than fission that produces almost no radioactive waste . first proposed in 1985 , iter relies on an oft-squabbling , international cadre of experts who vie for the spotlight and struggle to convince politicians that it 's still viable . the us has yanked and recommitted funding over the years , and a family-owned company in san diego is building the all-important solenoid—in this case , a 20-mile-long cable wrapped around a metal column—to harness the plant 's plasma in a " magnetic bottle " ( because no physical material can contain it ) . but engineering challenges remain , and parts made around the world may or may not all fit together . if they do , earth could have a new energy source in about 10 years . " i think iter is an absolute necessity for the world—otherwise i would n't put up with the frustrations , " says a top iter official . click for the full article , or see a science insider report on a damning assessment of iter 's management .
