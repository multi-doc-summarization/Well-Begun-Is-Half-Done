florida authorities have let the imagined voice of an 8-year-old girl who went missing on memorial day weekend in 1984 take over the palm beach county sheriff ’ s department twitter account . through a series of tweets with the hashtag # justice4luna , they led a social media campaign that included the tweets " help ! ! ! " and " why are you taking me ? why are you doing this ? nothing will ever be the same after this . " the washington post calls it " an eerily unorthodox campaign to resurrect the girl ’ s story—by resurrecting the girl . " and while many seem to agree that the tweets are disturbing , the social media response has been largely positive , with people thanking the department for trying to revive interest in the 33-year-old case . the last time anyone saw her , marjorie " christy " luna had slipped out of her house in a turquoise swimsuit and walked to belk 's general store to buy cat food while her mother napped , reports the new york daily news . the post reports that authorities suspect one victor wonyetye is responsible . he was at a party in her neighborhood the day she went missing and soon moved to new hampshire , where an 8-year-old girl went missing while walking to school . he died in 2012 after being released from prison for indecent exposure and burglary , and inmates claim he admitted to killing both girls . canadian authorities used a similar social media campaign in the hopes of finding a girl who went missing in 1986 , and say it brought information that made it " absolutely worthwhile . " ( this cold case has had numerous twists . )
