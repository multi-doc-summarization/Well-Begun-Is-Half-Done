the baltic sea 's trove of shipwrecks has preserved all kinds of history—much of it about war—and recently sparked fears of a fresh conflict in europe . bordered by scandinavia , finland , the baltics , the north european plain , and accessible by russia , one sliver of the sea contains about 1,000 known shipwreck objects , maritime expert thomas dehling tells deutsche welle . he 's referring to what slumbers in 6,000-square-miles of " german waters , " which he says represent not even a tenth of the full sea . " many of the objects are n't large shipwrecks , but much smaller , or partially submerged [ ones ] , " he says . " we still find 10 to 15 objects every year that we did n't know about before . " most are from world war i and ii , but not all : a swedish three-masted warship called the mars went down in 1564 while battling the danes and may have been cursed by its own cannons , national geographic reported last year . discovered in 2011 , the warship sank when its cannons overheated and exploded during battle ; legend says it was cursed because swedish kings repurposed church bells to build the cannons . in another baltic find , 168 bottles of perfectly preserved 19th-century french champagne were discovered on a sunken schooner near finland , smithsonian reports . " it was incredible , " says a scientist of the bubbly that later sold for up to $ 100,000 a bottle . then last year , sweden saw its cold war fears revived—and concerns about modern russia heightened—when said it spotted a foreign sub in its waters . sweden now says a russian sub may have indeed been found in the baltic ... but the wreckage is thought to be that of a wwi vessel that likely went down almost 100 years ago .
