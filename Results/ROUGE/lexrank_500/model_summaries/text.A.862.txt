a pretty dismal number on today 's jobs report : just 74,000 jobs were created in december , the smallest monthly increase in three years ; economists had expected 200,000 . and while the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 % from 7.0 % , it was " for all the wrong reasons , " writes steven russolillo at the wall street journal . specifically , the big drop can be explained by the fact that the participation rate fell to a new low of 62.8 % , meaning fewer people were looking for work . the ap reports that cold weather could have played a role in the poor numbers , noting that construction firms cut 16,000 jobs—the largest drop in 20 months . one silver lining from the report : november 's new jobs were revised upward to 241,000 from 203,000 . and russolillo writes that the same could happen here . " something doesn ’ t smell right . this jobs number is so far out of whack from the recent economic data that have come out . jobs data have been getting stronger for months , not to mention improvements in growth , housing , and manufacturing figures . do n't be surprised if this report gets revised higher in the coming months .
