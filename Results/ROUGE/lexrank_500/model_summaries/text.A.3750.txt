life of one kind or another has been around on this planet for 300 million years longer than thought , according to us researchers who took a close look at some incredibly ancient crystals unearthed in australia . the scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic , reuters reports . that 's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself , roughly 4.5 billion years ago . before now , the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old . there 's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed , the researchers write in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the hadean , after hades , because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed , the new scientist notes . the ucla and stanford researchers now dispute that , saying life on earth may have formed " almost instantaneously " —and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point . " the early earth certainly was n't a hellish , dry , boiling planet ; we see absolutely no evidence for that , " study co-author mark harrison says in a ucla press release . " the planet was probably much more like it is today than previously thought. ” ( earth 's first big predator may have been an enormous sea scorpion . )
