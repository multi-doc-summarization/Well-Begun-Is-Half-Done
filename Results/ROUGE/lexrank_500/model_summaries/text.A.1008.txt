" plus i thought we should get all used to wearing stripes . " ) and beck bennett as vp mike pence . meanwhile , at the snl version of the white house , aidy bryant brought back her impersonation of press secretary sarah huckabee sanders that slate says " singlehandedly saved the day . " but guest-host david is taking some heat over his monologue , notes people , in which he cracked that “ i ’ ve always been obsessed with women , and i ’ ve often wondered : if i ’ d grown up in poland when hitler came to power and was sent to a concentration camp , would i still be checking out women in the camp ? " he wondered before musing about flirting . " the problem is , there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp . "
