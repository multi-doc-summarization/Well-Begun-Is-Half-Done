excited to head back to your school reading days with the new flick the giver ? you may not be after reading what the critics have to say . despite big names like meryl streep and jeff bridges , the film adaptation of lois lowry 's classic 1993 novel has just a 29 % approval rating from critics on rotten tomatoes . here 's why : " another week , another movie about a special adolescent who saves society from the forces of darkness , " writes liam lacey at the globe and mail . the giver is too much of " the same old , same old " in which " lowry ’ s serious but simplified ideas get reduced to a barrage of visual kitsch . " " the giver was ahead of its time as a book . but as a movie , it ’ s too late , " writes joe neumaier at the new york daily news . he 's one of several critics to note the similarity to recent flicks like the hunger games and divergent . he acknowledges , however , " young audiences may become aware of touchstones " like nelson mandela or tiananmen square " that they might normally have tuned out . " oh , and taylor swift appears in " an unnecessary cameo . " " the cast is good " and there are strong scenes when the giver , played by bridges , passes his knowledge on to receiver jonas , played by brenton thwaites . but the movie " just falls flat , in almost every way . it exists and not much else , " writes bill goodykoontz at the arizona republic . " it 's all too predictable , and way too heavy-handed . " ann hornaday at the washington post apparently did n't get the memo . lowry 's novel " comes to life , " she writes . it 's " handsomely directed " with " an appealing , sure-footed cast , " including strong performances from alexander skarsgard and katie holmes , who play jonas ' parents . overall , it " perceptively caters to its teenaged fans ' own cardinal desires and anxieties , " she writes .
