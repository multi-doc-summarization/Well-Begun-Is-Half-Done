greece 's top court has declared that sunday 's referendum on a bailout is constitutional , meaning the vote with huge implications for all of europe will proceed . the latest polls show a dead heat , reports ap , as leaders on both sides try to rally support—especially prime minister alexis tsipras , whose political life may be at stake . “ i ask you to say no to ultimatums , blackmail , and fear-mongering , ” he said in a tv address . “ no to divisions , no to those who want to spread panic. ” he sought to downplay the notion that a " no " vote could lead to greece leaving the euro zone . instead , he said , the referendum is about giving him more leverage to get a better deal from creditors . it 's the only way greece can " live with dignity in europe , " he said , per the bbc . the washington post has a primer on the financial reasons behind the vote , but a story in the new york times casts it in more personal terms . it 's largely become a referendum on tsipras himself , and the story suggests that 's why european leaders itching to get rid of him limited emergency funds to greek banks this week . the move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash , and his popularity tumbled . “ i don ’ t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence , ” says a us economist . “ when you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum , this is a very deliberate move to scare people. ” tsipras initially said he would step down if the " yes " vote prevails , but he has since backed down from that position .
