earlier this year , president trump noted " i just do n't want a poor person " in charge of economic posts in his administration , then touted commerce secretary wilbur ross as " a very rich person " who was up to the task . but just how rich ross really is is now up in the air , forbes reports , noting it 's yanked ross off its billionaires list after a one-month probe revealed that $ 2 billion or so or ross ' alleged fortune " never existed , " and that ross had engaged in an " apparent sequence of fibs , exaggerations , omissions , fabrications , and whoppers " with the magazine going back 13 years . the discovery came when ross , 79 , contacted forbes in october to refute his ranking : last year he was listed with a net worth of $ 2.9 billion on the forbes 400 ; he claimed he was worth closer to $ 3.7 billion . then forbes talked with 10 of ross ' ex-employees at his private equity firm , who noted a " penchant for misleading " that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines , suits , and refunds to backers . " wilbur does n't have an issue with bending the truth , " one longtime colleague says , while another is more blunt : " he 's lied to a lot of people . " the magazine delves into ross ' back story , including how , when he first made the forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $ 1 billion , " everyone that i knew that worked with wilbur knew it was n't true , " per a former colleague . when forbes told ross he was being removed from its billionaires club , ross retorted the magazine was n't counting family trusts that he was n't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of " more than $ 2 billion , " assets ross said he put into the trusts sometime " between the election and [ my ] nomination . " when forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that , ross cited " privacy issues " —and the magazine lays out other problems with ross ' story on the supposed $ 2 billion transfer . read the in-depth findings here .
