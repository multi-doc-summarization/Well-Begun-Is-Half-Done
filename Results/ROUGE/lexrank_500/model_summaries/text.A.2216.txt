the time 100—time magazine 's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world—has just hit the interwebs , and as usual , the names range from obvious to head scratching . the names you expect are there—barack obama , oprah , steve jobs—as are some you might not , or that seem to be in an odd category . glenn beck , for example , makes the list as a “ leader. ” the “ heroes ” category , meanwhile , contains a bunch of sports stars and entertainers—phil mickelson , ben stiller , and serena williams—alongside the likes of bill clinton or mir hossein mousavi , the winner of time 's reader poll . ashton kutcher makes the “ artists ” list , presumably because he has a twitter account , as does conan o'brien , presumably for being fired . you can see the whole list here , or , for extra fun , check out joel stein 's least influential list .
