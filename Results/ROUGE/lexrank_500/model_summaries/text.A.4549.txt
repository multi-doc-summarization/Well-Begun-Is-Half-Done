a trump administration official has called the president 's travel ban a " massive success , " but a cnn employee may beg to differ . per the atlanta journal-constitution , mohammed tawfeeq—an iraqi national and permanent legal us resident who 's an editor and producer for the news network—was held at hartsfield-jackson atlanta international airport sunday evening as he returned after being on assignment in iraq . now tawfeeq , who 's enjoyed permanent resident status since 2013 , is suing the department of homeland security and other government agencies for his detention , which the suit says was illegal . per courthouse news , tawfeeq was returning to the us from baghdad ( he travels to the middle east often for work ) on jan. 29 when a us customs and border protection officer pulled him aside . tawfeeq 's green card and passport were examined , he was interrogated about his trip , and he was told he 'd need to wait for " an email " from the proper authorities to clear him to enter the country . when he was finally allowed to leave , no one offered further explanation , and they did n't even stamp his passport or give him any entry papers . " the executive order has greatly increased the uncertainty involved in current and future international travel " for legal resident such as tawfeeq , the suit claims , per the hill . it also adds that , as a legal permanent resident , he should be afforded " greater procedural protections than non-immigrants/temporary aliens . " a cnn rep says the network supports tawfeeq and that his complaint " is a basic request to clarify and assert his rights under the law , " per the hill .
