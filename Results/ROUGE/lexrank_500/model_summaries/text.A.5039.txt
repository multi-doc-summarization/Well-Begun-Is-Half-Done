little fockers , the third and , critics promise , worst movie of the meet the parents franchise , opens with an extended enema joke , and pretty much goes downhill from there . here ’ s a healthy dose of the critical scorn being heaped on it : “ i suffered through little fockers wishing that i could have periodontal surgery instead , ” writes andrew o'hehir of salon . it ’ s a collection of “ creaky , homophobic gross-out gags that would make many eighth-graders roll their eyes in embarrassment. ” the only picture of the year more vulgar , pathetic and unfunny was the one brett favre allegedly sent over his cellphone , quips kyle smith of the new york post . it ’ s a movie “ of such boundless ineptitude that i ’ d rather watch student films , or even glee. ” yet ironically , it ’ s not tasteless enough . “ the jokes get halfway there and wimp out with a crude little splat , ” complains ty burr of the boston globe . it also suffers from egregious overacting from jessica alba . “ it ’ s like she has to pee really badly in every one of her scenes. ” “ rarely does a comedy bring such an overpowering sense of sadness , ” writes james berardinelli of reelviews . once , robert de niro was a truly great actor . but this movie “ represents a new low … a level of embarrassment to which i never thought i would see him sink . ”
