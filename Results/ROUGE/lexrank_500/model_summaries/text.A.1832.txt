tensions in the ukraine just keep escalating . although president obama warned russia not to send troops , vladimir putin today got official permission to do just that . the russian president asked parliament to let him send forces to the " territory of ukraine " to protect ethnic russians in the region of crimea and possibly elsewhere , reports ap . and in a not-so-surprising development , lawmakers agreed unanimously , reports cnn . earlier , the pro-russian prime minister of crimea had made a formal request of his own for putin 's help . the ukraine government in kiev , meanwhile , says russia already has sent 6,000 troops to crimea , even if it has n't acknowledged as much , reports the bbc . the upshot is that " the black sea peninsula appeared to slip beyond kiev 's control , " says reuters . and it quotes one political analyst who says " the scenario of crimea 's withdrawal ( from ukraine ) has been accelerated . " soldiers presumed to be either part of the russian military or at least backed by the military control the airports , government buildings , and the main communications center in crimea . airspace around the main airport in simferopol has been shut down .
