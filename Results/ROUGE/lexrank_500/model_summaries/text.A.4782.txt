a texas veterinarian may have angered a lot of people , but she wo n't be charged for allegedly killing a cat with an arrow through the head in april . the investigation into dr. kristen lindsey could find no substantial evidence lindsey committed a crime . though she posted a photo of herself with the dead cat on facebook , which she later deleted , the sheriff 's office could n't verify the photoâ€”and an austin county grand jury today " no billed " her , the county district attorney 's office says , according to the houston chronicle . a " no-bill " finding means there 's not enough proof to file charges , khou notes . a crowd gathered outside the courthouse today to protest the finding . " without more information , the state lacks proof that this incident even occurred in the state of texas , " the da says in a press release , adding that investigators also could n't prove the cat 's manner of death was cruel . ( the american veterinary medical association itself says a " bolt to the head , " performed correctly , is a humane way to euthanize , and , as kbtx notes , the press release also points out that in some parts of the us , hunting stray cats is perfectly legal . ) the sheriff 's office says it was told that lindsey was trying to protect her own pets from a " potentially rabid stray cat , " but the cat she 's accused of killing was reportedly a house pet named tiger who went missing . lindsey was fired from her job at an animal clinic after the photo went viral . as for her veterinary license , the da notes it is " not involved " in the texas board of veterinary medical examiners ' decision on that .
