" baio says he asked her to stop screaming because kids , including his daughter and a child or children of mack 's , were around , but she kept doing so , using curse words and repeating the above-mentioned " pussy " comment . he says she then grabbed him underneath his arms , shook him , and pushed him . but sources close to mack say any such movements were simply an attempt to illustrate , for baio 's education , how trump hugs women . the inquisitr notes that mack 's husband , chad smith , has publicly denounced trump , saying his backers are " uneducated whites " who voted a " sexual predator " into office .
