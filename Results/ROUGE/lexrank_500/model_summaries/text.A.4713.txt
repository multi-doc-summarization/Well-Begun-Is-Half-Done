baseball 's " sistine chapel " turns 100 today , a century to the day after its first regular-season game . as the oldest major-league stadium , fenway park has seen the boston red sox through a turbulent century , hosting heroes from babe ruth to ted williams to hank aaron , the boston globe notes . today , you can feel the stadium 's age , columnist dan shaughnessy tells usa today : " the seats between the aisles were built for people 5-foot-6 in 1912 , " and " some of the things that do n't work are never going to work . " " but overall , it is the jewel of baseball and the best place to watch a baseball game , " he concludes . the stadium was the product of a $ 120,000 purchase of 8 acres of land in boston . nearly a century later , the park seemed old-fashioned and small compared to others , and it faced a shutdown . but new owners invested $ 285 million to bring it up to date , and it 's expected to stay in business another 40 years . " we think of fenway as the 'little engine that could , ' and it just keeps chugging along , " red sox co-owner tom werner says . today , the sox celebrate the anniversary with a game against—who else ? —the new york yankees .
