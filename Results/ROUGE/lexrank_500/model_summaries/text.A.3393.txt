the pilgrims may not have eaten any turkey at the " first thanksgiving " in 1621—no mention of turkey is specifically mentioned in edward winslow 's account of the feast , but he does mention that a lot of venison was eaten , and they probably ate fish and shellfish as well—so why is it the traditionally accepted main course for thanksgiving today ? well , the week explains , william bradford 's journals were rediscovered and reprinted in 1856 , and he wrote about the wild turkey hunts the colonists engaged in in 1621 . plus , turkey is a very american bird , and a large enough one to feed a table full of people , so when abraham lincoln officially made thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863 , that 's what was on the menu . the pilgrims did n't eat cranberry sauce , either , considering sugar was a luxury at the time and it 's kind of an integral ingredient in the sauce . ( they may have eaten plain cranberries , though ; national geographic notes that the fruit was a sort of native american " superfood . " ) and neither sweet potatoes nor white potatoes were around in america quite yet , so those were n't on the menu either , nor was pumpkin pie—since the pilgrims probably did n't have the butter or flour they would have needed to make the crust . if you 'd like to be historically accurate at least when it comes to the beverages , the pilgrims probably drank hard apple cider , the daily beast reports .
