in what the new york times calls " an extraordinary punishment that might be without precedent in olympics history , " the russian track and field team has been banned from competition at the summer olympics . seven months ago , the world anti-doping agency published a scathing report accusing russia of a doping scheme involving the government , law enforcement , athletes and coaches , and even doctors , a lab , and russia 's anti-doping agency . since then , the nation 's track and field athletes have been suspended from international competition ; russian authorities did not fight that suspension , though russia has denied the allegations . the iaaf , track and field 's global governing body , made the decision about the rio games friday . usa today says it will almost certainly be challenged , naming one pole vaulter who has threatened to file a discrimination case . russian officials had volunteered to send only athletes who had never been disciplined for drug use . but , per a source familiar with the iaaf 's decision , officials say russia has n't done enough to convince the world its athletes are clean . the international olympic committee will discuss the iaaf 's decision next week , but the times says it would be unusual for the ioc to amend the ruling . whistleblowers have alleged that russia 's doping scheme has allowed athletes to appear clean even when they 're not . before the iaaf 's vote friday , russia 's sports minister released an open letter insisting that the country was fighting doping and noting that uk authorities recently conducted independent testing of russian athletes . but wada had earlier alleged that many russian athletes evaded that testing and that russian officials threatened the testing authorities .
