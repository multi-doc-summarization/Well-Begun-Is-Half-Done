microsoft unleashed windows 8 on the world today , in the form of a " consumer preview " ( read : open beta ) , and it 's definitely not business as usual . the os is designed to work on both tablets and pcs , and that means that , while it still has a familiar windows " desktop " mode tucked inside , its default is a bold new " metro " system that ( gasp ) does away with " windows " entirely . apps , which must be purchased from the windows store , all run essentially full screen . here 's what people are saying : farhad manjoo of slate calls it " fantastic , jarring , and risky at the same time . " microsoft clearly thinks metro is the future— " you get the sense that the company is keeping the desktop interface around the same way it included the command prompt in windows 95 " —but he found it awkward on his desktop . " i felt like i was wasting a lot of my display . " " it 's by far the most integrated and most capable operating system microsoft has ever put out , " gushes seth rosenblatt of cnet . " there 's a speed and responsiveness to windows 8 that no other version of windows has ever had . " his assessment : " it would be beyond shocking if windows 8 landed like vista did . " but peter pachal for mashable " the same problem bubbles up time and again in windows 8 : unintuitiveness . metro is a beautiful and powerful interface , but it 's hard to get used to , " and lots of little things do n't work the way you 'd expect . " i think it 's going to get rough welcome , " predicts jason cross of pc world . " people often do n't like change at first . " but he likes it . " i 'm impressed by its speed and elegance . let me say that again : i 'm impressed by the speed and elegance of a micrsoft interface . really ! "
