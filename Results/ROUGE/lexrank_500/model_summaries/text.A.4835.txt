in a sign of just how frustrated some in the gop are with special counsel robert mueller after " indictment week , " three house republicans introduced a measure friday that would pressure mueller to step down . the nonbinding measure , introduced by reps. matt gaetz , andy biggs , and louie gohmert , would put the house on record as believing mueller should resign because he 's unfit to lead the investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election , politico reports . why ? due to " obvious conflicts of interest , " including his relationship with james comey , who succeeded him at the fbi and was later ousted from his post by president trump ; among other things , mueller is investigating whether anyone in the trump administration obstructed justice during that ouster . per fox news , the measure also makes note of mueller 's supervision of a bribery probe when he was fbi director that involved a russian nuclear-energy company that got approval from us government agencies to buy a canadian energy company that had mining operations in the us . " evidence has emerged that the fbi withheld information from congress and from the american people about russian corruption of american uranium companies , " gaetz said in a statement wondering how the deal got us approval despite the bribery probe . the representatives say that 's another reason mueller should recuse himself as special counsel , as his " impartiality is hopelessly compromised . " but , as multiple outlets including business insider note , most republicans so far support keeping mueller in place , including those in leadership positions .
