" i want to feel free without asking myself whether my creations will please the michelin inspectors , " he says . he adds that the 2003 suicide of french chef bernard loiseau , whose restaurant had been rumored to being close to losing its third star , was a factor . his father is supportive of his decision , afp reports , via eater , and another three-star chef who shut his own restaurant tells the telegraph , " when the michelin guide is no longer a driving force , it 's better to change lanes .
