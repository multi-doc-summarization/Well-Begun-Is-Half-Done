nintendo 's console business might be on its last life . the company today slashed its wii u sales forecast for the year ending in march by a staggering 70 % , anticipating sales of just 2.8 million units , reuters reports . it also halved its projection for wii u game sales to 19 million units , and dropped its 3ds forecast from 18 million to 13.5 million . the numbers are especially bad , because the second year of sales is typically a peak period for consoles , the wall street journal points out . " we are thinking about a new business structure , " president satoru iwata said in an apologetic news conference , according to bloomberg . he said the company wanted to take advantage of mobile gaming , but " it 's not as simple as enabling mario to move on a smartphone . " some analysts say the company is investing heavily in research and development , and could even have a new console in the works . despite losing money for now three years in a row , the company is sitting on $ 4.44 billion in cash .
