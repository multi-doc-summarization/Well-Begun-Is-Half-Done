anchorman 2 brings the " legendary " ron burgundy into the 1980s and a new medium : 24-hour news . the sequel brings back the absurdity of the first and even takes a few swings at satire , and while it may not equal its predecessor , critics say it 's worth a watch . " it 's not unusual for comedies to sink to silly-stupid depths . a rare few are bona fide silly-funny . anchorman , and now its follow-up , fall into the latter category of inspired lunacy , " writes claudia puig in usa today . " the chemistry and improvisational energy of this comic quartet " —will ferrell , steve carell , paul rudd , and david koechner— " fuel the comedy . " meanwhile , " nearly anyone who is anybody in contemporary comedy ... makes an appearance . " anchorman 2 " recaptures the silly , sloppy spirit of its predecessor , minus the crucial element of surprise . it ’ s a frequently amusing , occasionally hilarious , rarely unpleasant grab bag of mild mockery and inspired lunacy , " observes ao scott in new york times . the film " manages to make some smart satirical hay in the course of its stupidity , " writes chris vognar in the dallas morning news . " at times , anchorman 2 blurs the line between depicting stupid and being stupid . at other times , it ’ s a spot-on parody , not just of cable news ’ dawn but also its current incarnation . " " while i 'm glad anchorman is back , " notes betsy sharkey in the los angeles times , " i do wish it were better . with so many sight gags and nearly every living comic in the world making an appearance at some point , the entire operation , like ron 's ego , feels a bit bloated . " but carell and kristen wiig " create some of the strangest romantic chemistry the big screen has seen in a while—maybe ever . "
