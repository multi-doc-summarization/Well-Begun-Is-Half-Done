the ethics troubles of maxine waters and charlie rangel have led to what both the hill and politico call a rare bit of public infighting on the house ethics panel . the republicans on the panel demanded today that democrats schedule separate trials for the two democrats before the november elections . anything else is just stalling to avoid negative headlines , said ranking gop member jo bonner . “ after months of trial preparation—and , in the rangel matter , two years of investigation—chairwoman zoe lofgren should have already issued notices of public trial schedules in both the rangel and waters matters , ” said bonner . congressional ethics committees general work in bipartisan secrecy to settle such things . both waters ( earlier stories here ) and rangel ( earlier stories here ) have fiercely denied any wrongdoing .
