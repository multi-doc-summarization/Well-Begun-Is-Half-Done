less than a fortnight remains before election day , and donald trump is attempting an 11th-hour outreach to an entirely new demographic : indian-americans , reports the washington post . and so he 's released a tv ad in which he attempts to speak hindi ( with a new york accent , the post notes ) , swapping his name into a slogan used by indian pm narendra modi during his own 2014 campaign . the 30-second ad kicks off with a diwali greeting , followed by an abruptly edited score and clips from a trump speech he gave to indian-americans in new jersey on oct. 15 . in that speech , he promises the us will be a " true friend " to the " indian and hindu community " and help it defeat " radical islamic terrorism . " " we love the hindus ! we love india ! " he proclaims . then , his new catchphrase as he speaks directly to viewers : " ab ki baar , trump sarkaar " ( " this time , a trump government " ) . as for reaction from delhi residents , the bbc found that trump " still has some work to do " in wooing indians . one commenter on the street said he was " disgusted " by trump 's appeal to only the hindu community when " muslims , sikhs , and christians also live in this country " and noted he hoped " americans will be smart enough to not vote this guy into power . " a female respondent said , " he is not a friend of india , " adding his speech seems " rehearsed " and that he appears to be a " man of contradictions . " " he first berates immigrants and then tries to woo indian-americans , " she said . ( a hindu nationalist party had a special surprise for donald on his 70th birthday . )
