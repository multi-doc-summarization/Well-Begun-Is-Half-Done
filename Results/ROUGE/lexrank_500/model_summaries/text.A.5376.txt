last week , gizmodo claimed that an investigation showed most of the female user profiles on ashley madison were either fake or inactive—the same complaint hackers had about the site before leaking a massive amount of data—and now the cheating website is hitting back . " recent media reports predicting the imminent demise of ashley madison are greatly exaggerated , " avid life media , ashley madison 's parent company , says in a statement picked up by reuters . in fact , the company claims that not only have hundreds of thousands of people signed up for ashley madison accounts in the past week , but 87,596 of those people are women . today 's statement notes that an unnamed reporter—presumably referring to the gizmodo writer—incorrectly calculated the number of active female users when looking at the leaked data , and that in truth , " last week alone , women sent more than 2.8 million messages within our platform . " ars technica notes that there 's no way to confirm the number of new sign-ups , and as for those 2.8 million messages , " the company ... made no assurances that the female messages were n't generated by automated scripts . " and engadget notes that while avid life media 's statement also claims the ratio of men to active ladies on the site is 1.2 to 1 , the company " is n't outlining the ratio of real to fake women , so it 's not clear whether real women are bountiful or needles in the proverbial haystack . " on another note , the leaked ashley madison data revealed that avid life media had been " struggling to sell itself or raise funds " in the three years before the hack , reuters reports .
