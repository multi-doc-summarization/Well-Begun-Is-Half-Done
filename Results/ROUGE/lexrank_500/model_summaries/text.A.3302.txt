the power struggle between iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei is getting more intenseâ€”and a lot weirder . several people close to ahmadinejad and his chief of staff , esfandiar rahim mashaei , have been arrested in recent days and charged with being magicians and summoning genies , reports the guardian . ahmadinejad has faced harsh criticism from religious conservatives since he returned to work after going awol for 11 days because of a disagreement with khamenei . the feud appears to stem from reactions to unrest in the arab world , notes the washington post . khamenei and other religious leaders favor retrenchment , while ahmadinejad and his circle are believed to favor outreach . mashaei , ahmadinejad 's chosen successor , has made efforts to open lines of communication with washington in recent months , sources say . tensions have further increased with the release of a documentary that claims that hidden imam mahdi , shia islam 's savior , is about to return . senior clerics allege that a " perverted team " among ahmadinejad 's inner circle is responsible for the film .
