you can buy many things on the internet , and one of them is now the garish tie rob ford wore to the press conference in which he confessed he might be more than abstractly familiar with a substance we like to call crack cocaine , albeit only in a " drunken stupor . " the former hizzoner , who is battling an aggressive cancer , has as of yesterday listed various such treasures on ebay , including aforementioned tie , which is currently going for nearly $ 2,600 . per the listing : " you are bidding on an original piece of memorabilia from former toronto mayor , and current toronto councillor rob ford . " it comes with a " certificate of authenticity from councillor rob ford himself . " also up for grabs : some kind of weird moose-print jammies ford apparently " was seen wearing on a shopping trip to wal-mart " ; a " keep calm and carry on " sign that ford " added as a decoration to the mayor 's office in january , 2014 " ; and a saskatchewan roughriders jersey that " he got while attending a game in july of 2013 ( size 4xl ) . " but as gawker notes : " caveat emptor , eager rob ford collectors : torontorobford currently has a feedback score of 0 . "
