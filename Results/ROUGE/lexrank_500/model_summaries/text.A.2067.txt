donald trump is set to take the oath of office friday , but the ap reports that on sunday , an army band member stood in for the soon-to-be 45th president during an inauguration dress rehearsal at the capitol . band vocalist greg lowery—a 53-year-old sergeant major—says his role was to " look the part as much as possible , " and he says he bought a red tie for his assignment . " i believe he 's much handsomer than i but , i 'm honored to be a part of this , " lowery told wusa9 earlier . another band member , sara corry , was standing in for melania trump , a native of slovenia . the army specialist is from capistrano beach , calif . the goal of the rehearsal was to practice events so everything goes off as flawlessly—and on time—as possible for the real thing friday . the military foursome chosen to stand in for trump and pence and their respective wives were n't picked so much for their looks as they were for their height , notes wusa9 . " it 's crucially important because the escorts to the president and first lady will need to know their route . so they 'll need to rehearse escorting someone and they 'll need to set the heights of the microphones and the lighting , the camera angles to make sure that everything 's perfect for the day of the inauguration so that all goes without a flaw , " says neil ewichiw , who 's standing in for mike pence .
