russian hackers ' apparent infiltration of the white house computer network in october was n't exactly confidence-inspiring , even though it was the unclassified portion of the system that was breached . now us officials say some of the unclassified information that made its way onto hackers ' screens was related to president obama 's itinerariesâ€”not classified knowledge , but not exactly public knowledge , notes cnn . the hill points out that although the press has access to " a general outline " of obama 's daily routine , there are still phone calls and meetings that are n't made public , and that foreign spies would apparently love to know about . obama 's exact location at any given point during the day is also often kept on the down-low , and certain parts of the white house are off-limits to the press , the hill adds . besides the white house scheduling and press offices , others who use the hacked system include the general counsel 's office and the budget and legislative liaison offices , abc news reports . the hackers are believed to have accessed the white house network by first hacking state department files , according to investigators , which leads to the fear that hackers have gotten back into the state department system . one official tells cnn that the hackers have " owned " the network " for months . " " there 's always vulnerability , " deputy national security adviser ben rhodes noted at a press conference , per cbs news . " the fact is that 's why we have a classified system because there 's less risk in the classified system , and that is secure . " ( the fbi is going after one russian hacker in particular . )
