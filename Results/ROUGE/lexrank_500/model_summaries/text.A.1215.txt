what kind of porn might be classified ? the stuff watched by osama bin laden . a blogger at the men 's website brobible filed a , er , colorful freedom of information act request with the cia to get the details on the " pornographic material " found among bin laden 's stuff . ( the request is here , and the language is a little graphic . ) david covucci got his formal answer this week from the spy agency : no dice . “ with regard to the pornographic material osama bin laden had in his possession at the time of his death , responsive records , should they exist , would be contained in operational files , ” and such files are exempt from foia requests , says the letter . even if they were n't in the operational files , it seems that covucci would have been out of luck : " to the extent that this material exists , the cia would be prohibited by 18 usc section 1461 from mailing obscene matter , " adds the letter . intelligence chief james clapper confirmed the porn 's existence last month , notes death and taxes , which finds it odd that the agency is keeping it wraps given the potential for embarrassment to al-qaeda . maybe it 's a job for wikileaks , suggests reason . and as for covucci , " hold your head up , bro , " writes peter holley at the washington post . " now you ’ ve got a cool letter you can frame . "
