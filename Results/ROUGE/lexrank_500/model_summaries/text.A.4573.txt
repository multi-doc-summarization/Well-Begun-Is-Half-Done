the number of coral-plundering crown of thorns starfish could boom from some 12 million to 60 million over the next four years , the brisbane times reports , and for australia 's great barrier reef that would be akin to " a locust plague devastating vegetation , " says glen holmes , co-author of the starfish that eat the reef . this winter , though , an aquatic robot will be deployed to help slow the invasion of the invertebrates … by killing them , scientific american reports . the cotsbot , developed at the queensland university of technology , is a small submarine outfitted with cameras , sonar , gps , and a syringe-tipped arm . following a pre-programmed path along the reef , the robot scans for crown of thorns starfish . once it identifies its target , the cotsbot pumps it full of bile salts that , as scientific american puts it , " digest the animal from the inside " before it can separate and regenerate ( one starfish can produce millions of young ) . the cotsbot , which can kill more than 200 starfish in eight hours , will augment the efforts of human divers . “ it 's now so good it even ignores our 3d-printed decoys and targets only live starfish , ” one researcher says . it is believed the starfish has destroyed some 230 square miles of live coral in the past three decades , per the times , which says the outbreak may be linked to starfish-nourishing algal blooms resulting from fertilizer runoff . overfishing of the starfish 's predators may also be to blame , per scientific american . check out the cotsbot in action in this video .
