" if only they could just hug it out , " laments the new york daily news in the case of connell v. tarala—connell being 54-year-old jennifer connell , tarala her 12-year-old nephew sean , who she claims was so excited at his birthday party four years ago that he broke her wrist , the connecticut post reports . the new york city woman , who 's suing sean for $ 127,000 , testified in court friday that when she arrived at her nephew 's birthday party in westport , conn. , on march 28 , 2011 , sean was riding his brand-new bike outside . when he saw connell , she said , he ran toward her yelling , " auntie jen , auntie jen ! " and then flung his 50-pound body at her , knocking them both to the ground and breaking her wrist . " i remember him shouting , 'auntie jen , i love you , ' and there he was flying at me , " she testified . connell told the jury she did n't complain about her injury at the time because " it was his birthday party and i did n't want to upset him , " but she noted that the broken wrist upended her busy life . " i live in manhattan in a third-floor walk-up , so it has been very difficult , " she said . " and we all know how crowded it is in manhattan . " not to mention how it affected her in social situations : " i was at a party recently , and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate , " she noted . even though connell says sean—who the post notes listened with his dad to his aunt 's testimony looking " confused " ; his mom died last year—has always been " very loving " and " sensitive " toward her , she thinks he should still be liable and understand that his actions have consequences . ( these parents got an invoice after their son was a no-show at a birthday party . )
