a report to congress alleges that china briefly hijacked a chunk of the world 's web traffic , including some from us military facilities , before sending it on its way . ( the actual amount rerouted is in dispute . ) china denies it , but tech writers are pretty sure it happened . cause for alarm ? a definite maybe . bob sullivan , msnbc : " if there is a grey area between honest mistakes and outright cyber attack , these incidents probably fall right in the middle—if not a pre-planned testing of the waters , then certainly a happy accident with valuable results to be studied by would-be cyber-attackers . " nate anderson , ars technica : " the culprit here was 'ip hijacking , ' a well-known routing problem in a worldwide system based largely on trust . " but as is usually the case with these things , " it 's hard to know if anything bad happened here . the entire thing could have been a simple mistake . besides , internet traffic is n't secure and already passes through many servers outside of one 's control . " jesus diaz , gizmodo : " perhaps it was n't a malicious move , but it certainly seems like a test to its network power . in any case , it seems like it can happen again at any time . i do n't know about you , but i do n't feel comfortable with the idea of china hijacking such a massive amount of information without explanation . " dmitri alperovitch , mcafee : “ this is one of the biggest—if not the biggest hijacks—we have ever seen , " the security expert tells national defense magazine . " and it could happen again , anywhere and anytime . what happened to the traffic while it was in china ? no one knows . ”
