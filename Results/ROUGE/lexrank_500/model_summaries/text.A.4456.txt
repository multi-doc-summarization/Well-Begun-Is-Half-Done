an airstrike killed the islamic state 's " jihadi john " last year , but a new isis spokesman with a british accent appears to have taken his place . the group released a video in which the masked man warns that isis will attack the uk in retaliation for britain 's support of the us-led coalition that 's bombing syria , reports usa today . the video also purports to show five men from syria and libya , alleged spies for britain , being executed with a gunshot to the head , reports the bbc . the telegraph labels the militant the " new jihadi john " in its headline and notes that the video has another " chilling twist " : a young boy clad in military clothes warns in what sounds like a british accent that isis is going to kill non-muslims . the video has n't been authenticated yet . " only an imbecile would dare to wage war against a land where the law of allah reigns supreme , " says the adult militant , addressing david cameron . " the islamic state , our country , is here to stay . and we will continue to wage jihad , break borders , and one day invade your land , where we will rule by the shariah . " he also calls cameron a " slave of the white house " and a " mule of the jews . "
