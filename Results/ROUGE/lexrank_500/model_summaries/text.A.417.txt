guys might be good at carrying heavy furniture but they tire faster than their female counterparts , new research out of the university of british columbia shows . " we 've known for some time that women are less fatigable than men during isometric muscle tests—static exercises where joints do n't move , such as holding a weight—but we wanted to find out if that 's true during more dynamic and practical everyday movements , " says ubc researcher brian dalton in a press release . " and the answer is pretty definitive : women can outlast men by a wide margin . " collaborating with the university of guelph and university of oregon , the researchers report in the journal applied physiology , nutrition , and metabolism that a handful of men and women were asked to flex their foot against sensors as fast as they could 200 times . those sensors captured several metrics , including speed , power , torque , and even electrical activity in their muscles . the men were both faster and more powerful , but they also became more fatigued " much faster " than the women . dalton notes that in ultra-trail running , men tend to be faster , but women tend to be far less tired ; in fact in outside , one runner calls for separate goals for women . " if ever an ultra-ultra-marathon is developed , women may likely dominate , " dalton says . but as for the mars-vs.-venus battle , dalton jokes , " there 's no battle at all . maybe more of a balance of the sexes . " more seriously : " both sexes have valuable physical abilities and it only makes sense that we study and develop the tools to afford them the best advantage . " ( sex gets better with age for women . )
