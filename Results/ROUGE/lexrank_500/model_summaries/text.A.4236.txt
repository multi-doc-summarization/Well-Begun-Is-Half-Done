ashley judd can do drama , comedy , and action , but top democrats are increasingly skeptical that she has the chops to play the junior senator from kentucky . while judd looks toward a run for mitch mcconnell 's seat next year , party power brokers—including bill clinton—are trying to convince kentucky secretary of state alison lundergan grimes to run instead , reports politico . mcconnell 's seat is top of the party 's hit list for 2014 . a judd candidacy would guarantee the party both big headlines and fundraising dollars . but some are worried that a hollywood liberal who currently lives in tennessee wo n't play well to a kentucky base . grimes , a more established politician with strong family connections in the party , offers a far less controversial choice . but that 's assuming clinton and co. can convince her to run at all . " why would [ grimes ] take on this race ? ” said a former mcconnell chief of staff . “ she could run for a state office with little opposition or run against mcconnell and endure $ 30 million in career-ending advertising . " judd 's big sister wynonna , however , is predictably and firmly in her corner , telling us weekly , " of course i 'd vote for her ! " though maybe just because blood is thicker than water : " i do n't agree with anything she says half the time . we 're so different . but i love my sister . i am for ashley . "
