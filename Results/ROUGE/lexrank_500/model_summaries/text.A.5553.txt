staged or not staged ? that seems to be the question surrounding aubrey plaza 's stage-crashing moment last night at the mtv movie awards . the parks & rec star came onstage while will ferrell was accepting an award , and tried to grab the trophy without actually saying anything . an awkward tug of war followed , until plaza finally returned to her seat as ferrell said , " aubrey plaza , everyoneâ€”just like we rehearsed it . " but mtv claims the incident was not staged . plaza had a cup in her hand ( which she dropped en route back to her seat ) and had the name of her upcoming film , the to do list , written on her chest ; many speculated on twitter and elsewhere that she was drunk at the time . producers later asked her to leave . even so , vulture seems skeptical . " if it was n't planned , why the heck was she sitting in the front row ? " writes jesse david fox . " a bit too convenient for something that was n't rehearsed or planned , no ? " and jezebel notes that it was also " the most exciting thing that happened " during the show . plaza responded to the controversy today , tweeting , " thanks for the advice @ kanyewest went better than planned ! " in reference to kanye crashing taylor swift 's mtv acceptance speech .
