well , zte is back in business—sort of . washington will drop sanctions against the chinese telecommunications giant if it makes management changes and pays a big fine , a congressional aide tells reuters . president trump tweeted more , saying that " i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees , change of management and board , must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $ 1.3 billion fine . " but he 's taking political fire from democrats and republicans alike for dealing with a company that many consider a national security threat . " president trump would be helping make china great again , " says sen. charles schumer , per the washington post . " simply a fine and changing board members would not protect america ’ s economic or national security . " sen. marco rubio struck a similar note , tweeting that " # china crushes u.s. companies with no mercy & they use these telecomm companies to spy & steal from us . " ( techcrunch goes into detail , saying that over the past 5 years zte has been sued an " astonishing " 126 times in the us alone for patent infringement—not to mention that it violated sanctions by selling to north korea and iran and then lied about it . ) but trump was under pressure , with beijing demanding mercy for zte in order to resume china-us trade talks on june 2 , the financial times reports . so does congress have a veto-proof majority to prevent trump 's move ? " passing such a law could be difficult , " says the post , though lawmakers may pull other political levers to try influencing the white house . ( see trump 's defense of easing zte sanctions . )
