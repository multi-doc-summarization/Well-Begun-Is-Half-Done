the state department 's unusually strong warnings this week about a possible terror threat—it announced that 21 us embassies would be closed tomorrow and followed that up with a global travel alert for americans—came after authorities intercepted communications among what the new york times calls " senior operatives " of al-qaeda , a rarity . and this was apparently no idle chatter : cnn reports that al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula was in the " final stages of planning for an unspecified attack , " with particular concern about the us embassy in yemen between today and tuesday . the timing dovetails with the end of ramadan . “ there is a significant threat stream and we ’ re reacting to it , ” gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , tells abc news for its this week program . he says it is “ more specific ” than usual , though the exact target is unspecified . “ the intent is to attack western , not just us interests . " rep. peter king made a similar point to cnn : the information is " the most specific i 've seen , " he says , adding , " we are focused on the middle east , but it 's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace .
