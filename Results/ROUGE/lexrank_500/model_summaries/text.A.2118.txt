as the muslim holy month of ramadan kicked off over the weekend , so , too , did an ad by a telecom company in kuwait tackling terrorism . cnn reports on zaid 's three-minute music video , which has so far amassed more than 3.6 million views , showing a suicide bomber being confronted by victims ( some of them actual victims of past terror attacks ) in the wake of a bus bombing . " you 've filled the cemeteries with our children and emptied our school desks , " a child 's voiceover notes as the man works on his weapon , while others refute him after the act has been carried out . " i bear witness that there is no god but allah , " he tells a busload of dust-covered passengers , to which one man responds , " you who comes in the name of death , he is the creator of life . " the terrorist is then driven out by a crowd , with one man singing phrases such as , " let 's bomb delusion with the truth . " the guardian notes tv viewing spikes in arab communities during ramadan , as people hunker down at home to fast . the video is earning praise , with one prominent emirati commentator calling it " a beautiful ad on counter violence and extremism " on twitter . yet others were rankled by the fact that terrorism victims were featured ( some say it 's exploitative ) and that an actor played the part of omran daqneesh , the child in a now-famous photo out of syria after his home was hit in an airstrike . " part of justice for any victim is to expose his killer , " one writer notes , pointing out the real omran was n't attacked by extremists but by the syrian regime . still others say the ad just preaches to the choir and does n't get to the heart of what drives terrorism . " what 's the ad saying ? … the criminals … will laugh at us , " a syrian communications expert says . ( a us airport 's anti-terror efforts . )
