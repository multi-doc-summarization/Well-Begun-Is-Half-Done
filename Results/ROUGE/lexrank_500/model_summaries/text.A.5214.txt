" it is time to say husband is not the master , " dipak misra , the chief justice of india 's top court , says in a ruling striking down the country 's adultery law . " legal sovereignty of one sex over another is wrong . " the ruling jettisoning the 158-year-old colonial-era law means adultery is no longer a crime in india , the bbc reports . long criticized as archaic and sexist , it made it illegal for a man to have sex with a married woman without the permission of her husband . misra said that while adultery could certainly be an issue in civil cases like divorce , " it can not be a criminal offense . " the law had been challenged three previous times , most recently in 1988 . " i welcome this judgment by the supreme court , " says rekha sharma , the head of india ’ s national commission for women . " it was an outdated law , which should have been removed long back . " she notes that the law dated from the british colonial era—but the british got rid of their version of the law many years ago . government lawyers had urged the court to keep the law , arguing that " making adultery legal will hurt marriage bonds . " the guardian reports that those who brought the case had only sought to make the law gender neutral , but the court decided to simply get rid of it . ( earlier this month , the court struck down a colonial-era law banning gay sex . )
