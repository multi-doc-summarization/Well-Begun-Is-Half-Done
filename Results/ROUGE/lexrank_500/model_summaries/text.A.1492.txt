maddy wilford was shot multiple times in the parkland school massacre and was near death as first responders tended to her after the shooting . but an observant coral springs fire department lieutenant asked the teen an important question as they prepared to whisk her away , and it was one that ended up saving her life . per cnn , maddy was in such bad shape when she was brought to lt. laz ojeda and his rescue team that they initially thought she 'd already died . " signs of life , " however , soon emerged , and after a broward county sheriff 's office swat team member sealed up a chest wound , they readied her to go to a children 's hospital 30 miles away , where they 'd been instructed to take the 15-year-old . except ojeda was n't convinced she was only 15 . and so , as ojeda tearfully relayed at a monday presser , he asked the girl twice how old she was ; she finally answered she was 17 . based on that info , ojeda , who thought she 'd die before they got her to the children 's facility , made the call to take her to a hospital just 10 miles from marjory stoneman douglas high school . there , operating surgeon dr. igor nichiporenko quickly did " damage control " on the badly injured teen , who 'd been shot in the abdomen , chest , and upper sternum , with tendons " shattered from gunshot wounds . " astonishingly , wilford was out of the hospital in less than a week . " young people have a tendency to heal very fast , " nichiporenko says , per the new york times . " she 's very , very lucky . " he adds that ojeda 's decision saved maddy 's life . ojeda is just glad he was there to make the call . " i thank god for allowing us to be an instrument in this miracle , " he told cnn tuesday . as for maddy ? " i 'm so grateful to be here , " she said at the news conference , per cnn .
