take the velociraptors made famous by jurassic park , make them a bit smaller , add feathers , then change the limbs to wings and you will have something resembling a newly discovered dinosaur species found in china . researchers say changyuraptor yangi , a carnivore that lived around 125 million years ago , has the longest feathers ever found outside birds , to which it is very closely related . it 's a lot bigger than any other " four-winged " dinosaur species known , reports nbc news . researchers compare the creature , which was around 4 feet long and weighed about 9 pounds , to " a mid-sized turkey with a very long tail " and say that while it probably could n't fly the way modern birds do , it could flap its wings and the feathers would have helped it land safely despite its size . " so this does raise the possibility they could glide or 'fly ' in a primitive sort of way , " a paleontologist tells reuters . " the way i like to think of it is : if you pushed them out of a tree , they 'd fall pretty slowly . " ( another newly discovered dinosaur had bony " wings " on its head . )
