although high school students in the us might view taking the sat or act as an ordeal , those college entrance exams have nothing on china ’ s gaokao , a grueling two-day , nine-hour test that chinese students spend years preparing for . this year , an estimated 9.75 million students will take the test , notes reuters , and less than 1 % will do well enough to earn a spot in one of china ’ s premier universities , reports the new york times . now , the university of new hampshire plans to cull some of that talent . the school has announced that it will accept scores from the chinese exam on entrance applications , making it the first " flagship " state school in the us to do so . but submitting the gaokao results will not be the only test criteria . students will also be required to take an english test , participate in a video interview and send their high school transcripts , reports the bbc , and they may still need to take the sat or act exam . if admitted they would pay out-of-state tuition and housing costs of more than $ 45,000 a year . a few private institutions in the us as well as dozens of universities in europe , australia , and canada already accept gaokao results on applications . the university of san francisco has an early admissions program that allows june test takers to enroll in the fall semester , based on their grades , gaokao score , and personal interview in english . not everyone is a fan of the gaokao . critics say the test emphasizes memorization over creativity , but university of san francisco president paul j. fitzgerald notes that the gaokao can assess a student ’ s determination to work “ hard and consistently. ” ( she called a texas standardized test a " big baloney sandwich . " )
