no matter how much you like jason bateman and melissa mccarthy , critics are urging you to decline identity thief , their new—sadly conventional and unfunny—buddy comedy . here 's what critics are saying , including one who got himself in hot water : as a fan of bateman and mccarthy , mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle wanted to like it . but " what seemed like a good idea—a comedy based on the phenomenon of identity theft—turned out to be comic quicksand , " because having your life ruined at random is n't really funny . bateman comes off as " a dramatic character facing personal tragedy who just happens to be stuck in a supposed comedy . " the screenplay " tortures itself " to get its leads on a buddy-movie-esque road trip together , complains ty burr at the boston globe . " no , it does n't make sense . nothing in this movie makes sense . next to identity thief , inception is a marvel of sober concision . " it 's littered with " comedy clichés , " and worse , an " obnoxious sentimentality , " like the " generic equivalent of a judd apatow movie . " rex reed at the new york observer has drawn criticism of his own for calling mccarthy a " tractor-sized " " female hippo " who " has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success . " many have decried the review as sexist . " have you ever read a review where a male actor was described this way ? " asks adriana velez at the stir , pointing out the host of plus-sized male comedians who have n't faced that kind of ridicule . meanwhile manohla dargis at the new york times thinks mccarthy is the best part of the movie , " the supernova who burns up this show . " but ultimately this is " a lazy comedy " that is n't subversive enough to really cut her loose . " order must be restored , the family reunited , the wild woman tamed . " everyone must learn a lesson , " and then everything will fit tidily , phonily together . "
