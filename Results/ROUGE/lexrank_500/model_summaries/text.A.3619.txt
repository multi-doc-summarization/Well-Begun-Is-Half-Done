on the heels of a renewed hunt for treasure in a tiny french village comes the tale of buried treasure in california . the san francisco chronicle takes a look back at one of the state 's colorful historical figures : granville p. swift , the great-nephew of daniel boone who came to the state in the mid-1800s with a plan to be a fur trapper . gold called his name instead . he found it at bidwell 's bar , with the paper quoting a fellow prospector as saying swift was an exceptional miner who " must have made $ 100,000 " in one prospecting season . indeed , reports at the time indicate he arrived in san francisco with more than $ 500,000 in gold , which he had minted into octagonal slugsâ€”and began to bury around the bay area . the vacaville reporter previously reported that swift reburied roughly $ 100,000 in gold after building his mansion in 1858 , but the chronicle reports a " scatter-brained " swift failed to recall where he had put much of it . he died in 1875 with much of his haul secreted away in forgotten locations . some was found in the early 20th century , including $ 30,000 found in 1904 while repairing a chimney on his property . but the last big find was in 1914 , suggesting , in the chronicle 's view , there 's more out there to be found ... and not much more than unhelpful-seeming clues to go on . the reporter notes a " list in his handwriting miraculously survived , " but the clues are of this sort : " 1 tin box & 1 little bottle boath in the saim hoal .
