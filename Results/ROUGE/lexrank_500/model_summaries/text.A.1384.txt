when young adults in the us reach the age of majority , they take on full legal responsibility for themselves and can do fun things like vote , sign contracts , and open bank accounts . in japan , the same milestone means they get hit with rent charges and manifestos from their parents on how they 're pretty much on their own now . at least , that 's the case for japanese twitter user @ zamayuma1004 , who tweeted photos last week of the special gift his mom and dad presented him on the occasion of his 20th birthday ( the japanese age of majority ) . beautifully wrapped in an envelope tied with red and white string was a letter titled " notice of expiration of child-rearing services , " and its contents proved the parents were n't messing around , rocketnews24 reports via curazy , japan 's buzzfeed-style site . " as of october 4 , 2015 , your father , yoshikazu hasegawa , and mother , chiaki hasegawa , have completed their duties of raising their child : you , yuma hasegawa , " the letter reads , per a rocketnews24 translation . " going forward , please become a proper and responsible member of society , like your father and mother . " it then offers a bulleted list of advice for the new adult , including that yuma pay into his pension , " not drive while intoxicated , " and discuss any future possible wife with them or they " may not emotionally accept " her . they also mention the $ 168 they expect for rent and other household expenses and note that " should you ask for a loan from your parents , interest will be charged . " " please enjoy your life as an adult , " the note ends . meanwhile , yuma insists his parents are just joshing ( kind of ) and that he 's been contributing monetarily to the household since last year . ( centenarians probably wo n't be getting fancy birthday gifts in japan anymore . )
