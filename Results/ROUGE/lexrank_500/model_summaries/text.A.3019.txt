not a bad internet success story : step one : a 22-year-old creates a goofy website that allows you to have glitter sent to " people you hate . " step two : it explodes in popularity , so much so that australian mathew carpenter stops taking orders and pleads with people to please , god , stop asking him to handle glitter . step three : carpenter just sold the website , called shipyourenemiesglitter , for $ 85,000 , reports the guardian . a decent result for sure , though entrepreneur thinks carpenter committed the " eighth deadly sin of business " by squandering a genuine opportunity : " with more commitment and seriousness , carpenter probably could have had an actual successful business on his hands . " before he bailed , carpenter wrote that he had taken more than 2,000 orders at $ 7.99 a pop , and he estimated a profit of up to $ 6.50 on each one , reports cnbc . ( a woman is accused of using a glitter bomb , among other things , to get back at her former boss . )
