" but norway has made its decision , " says the chairman of the norwegian local radio federation . " for practical and economic reasons it is too late to turn back now . " norway will now be watched closely by the uk , south korea , sweden , and denmark , all considering the switch . switzerland plans to switch to digital in 2020 .
