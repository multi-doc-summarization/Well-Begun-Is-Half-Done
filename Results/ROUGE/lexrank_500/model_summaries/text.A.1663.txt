the rapidly disappearing " bird language " that is spoken—or whistled , actually—by about 10,000 residents in the mountains of turkey is changing the way scientists think about language and the brain . the left hemisphere has always been dominant when interpreting language , be it spoken , written , signed , or even clicked , explains new scientist . but that changed when german researcher onur güntürkün decided to study the whistled version of turkish . güntürkün wanted to see if its musicality might require the brain 's right hemisphere , which handles frequency , pitch , and melody . his study of 31 whistled turkish speakers showed the left hemisphere was 75 % dominant with spoken turkish , but the split between hemispheres was even with the whistled language . " we ’ ve shown for the first time equal contributions from both hemispheres , " says güntürkün , whose study was published in current biology . he tells the new yorker that this suggests our brain structure " is not as fixed as we assume " and that the way information is delivered changes it . the language developed because whistles carry further than spoken words , and its messages can be understood across mountains and valleys . ( the new yorker offers an example of a whistle that means , " do you have fresh bread ? " ) it 's lucky güntürkün got his study in when he did , as modern technology is killing off whistled turkish . " you can gossip with a mobile phone , but you ca n't do that with whistling because the whole valley hears , " he says . ( but , how does any of this explain how one man could lose most of his brain and not even notice ? )
