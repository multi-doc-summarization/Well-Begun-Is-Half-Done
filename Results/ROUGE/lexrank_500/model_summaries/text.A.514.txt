the man in black 's boyhood home has been added to the national register of historic places , though the arkansas democrat-gazette notes that it took two tries to get it there . the arkansas historic preservation program announced friday that the home in dyess where country music icon johnny cash lived from age 3 through high school has been added to the register . the nomination 's first failed attempt focused on the structure 's architectural significance rather than its connection to cash . the five-room farmhouse was built in 1934 as part of the dyess resettlement colony by the federal emergency relief administration , reports the ap . the democrat-gazette reports that the house is owned by arkansas state university , which spent $ 575,000 to buy , restore , furnish , and landscape the property . " when we grew up , it was second nature that we would n't live in dyess when we were grown , " cash once said . " it was the aim of every person to get a better job . but if i had n't grown up there , i would n't be what i am now . it was the foundation for what i became . " cash died in 2003 at age 71 .
