jk rowling embarked on quite the flight of fancy when inventing her pseudonym robert galbraith—and that might prove controversial . galbraith 's bio claims that he spent " several years with the royal military police " and that the protagonist of his novel—one-legged afghanistan veteran cormoran strike— " grew directly out of his own experiences and those of his military friends . " indeed , rowling created a full backstory for her alter ego , who apparently eventually found himself in the rmp 's plain-clothes special investigative branch , before leaving for the civilian security industry . while so far rowling 's invention appears to be flying under the radar , fake military service claims often prove contentious . in the us , it 's even illegal to profit from them , thanks to the new stolen valor act , which was signed into law last month to replace an earlier version struck down by the supreme court . then again , rowling probably could have profited more without the pseudonym ; since the reveal , sales of the cuckoo 's calling exploded 507,000 % at amazon , reports cnn , and it 's now out of stock online at both amazon and barnes and noble . ( a rep for the latter told the wall street journal it was n't a big seller pre-reveal . ) a new edition is coming that will acknowledge galbraith as a pseudonym for rowling .
