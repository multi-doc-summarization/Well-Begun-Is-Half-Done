diagnosing alzheimer 's is a guessing gameâ€”and many doctors are guessing wrong , according to early results from a new study presented wednesday in london . the washington post reports doctors tested 4,000 medicare patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and discovered many of them definitively do not have alzheimer 's . using pet scans , the study revealed only 54.3 % of mild cognitive impairment patients and 70.5 % of dementia patients had brains containing amyloid plaques . these plaques can be a sign of alzheimer 's . the patients who had them may or may not have alzheimer 's ; the remaining percentage definitely do n't have the disease . " to get that right diagnosis , that 's really important , " one woman , whose alzheimer 's diagnosis was ruled out by a pet scan , tells the ap . the findings show many people are potentially taking unnecessary alzheimer 's medication , and doctors may want to change their treatment to something cheaper or more effective . unfortunately , the only ways to test for amyloid plaques while a patient is alive are expensive pet scans , which are n't usually covered by insurance , or invasive spinal taps . or are they ? another study presented at the same london conference revealed a new blood test that could potentially reveal the plaques , new scientist reports . the tests are easy and cheap enough that doctors could administer them to patients during regular checkups . since plaques start showing up 15 to 20 years before alzheimer 's symptoms , patients could use the results to change certain lifestyle habits to decrease their risk .
