a mama grizzly linked to the mauling death of two hikers in yellowstone park has been killed by rangers . two men were mauled to death in separate incidents over the summer in the first bear killings in yellowstone in a quarter of a century . bear dna found at the site of the first mauling was also found at the site of the second death a month later . in the first attack , a grizzly sow with two cubs chased and killed a man as he hiked with his wife . a report by yellowstone rangers concluded that a possible " contributing factor " to the mauling was that the couple " ran from the bear while screaming and yelling , " and they decided not to track down the grizzly . " we made a decision at that time , based on all the information available , that we did not have a bear with a history or a bear that was demonstrating any predatory nature , " a park spokesman told the ap . but the same sow 's dna was found at the site of the second killing of a hiker walking aloneâ€”although tracks and dna from several other bears were also found at the body , and rangers ca n't be certain which animal killed the hiker . the euthanized grizzly 's two cubs were captured and relocated to the grizzly and wolf discovery center wildlife park in west yellowstone . an estimated 600 grizzlies live in the greater yellowstone area .
