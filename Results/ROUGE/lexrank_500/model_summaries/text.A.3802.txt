despite anticipation that lady gaga would make some kind of political statement during the super bowl halftime show , the pop star appeared to play nice , a performance of the lgbt-friendly " born this way " aside . even prominent conservatives hailed her " apolitical " show , the washington post notes , with tweeted praise from the likes of fox news , marco rubio , and even ivanka trump . but vanity fair reports that an " edgy political statement " may have been a " dog whistle " for president trump protesters with gaga 's choice of opening songs , a double hit of irving berlin 's " god bless america " followed by a portion of " this land is your land " —and the latter woody guthrie song is where gaga 's hidden message may lie . guthrie 's son arlo has said his dad wrote " this land " as a biting response to berlin 's patriotic song , and in the 1944 version the elder guthrie recorded on his guitar—he owned one sporting a " this machine kills fascists " sticker—the fourth verse contains some interesting ( and timely trump-tied lyrics ) that have since fallen out of the versions we hear today . to wit : " there was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / the sign was painted , said 'private property ' / but on the backside , it didn ’ t say nothing . " vanity fair notes that trump protesters have been crooning the song at rallies lately , and arlo guthrie and other singers like bruce springsteen keep the original lyrics in when they perform the song . in other words , teen vogue may have picked up on something major outlets missed . ( gaga made a big announcement after the super bowl . )
