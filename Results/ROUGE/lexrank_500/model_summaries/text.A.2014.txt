it turns out the nazis ' vision of the ideal aryan baby—one that was slapped on the cover of a magazine , on postcards , and disseminated in party propaganda—was a jewish baby . the telegraph resurfaces the remarkable story of hessy taft ( born hessy levinsons ) , a now 80-year-old who in 1935 , at just six months , was taken by her mother to a berlin photographer to have her baby photo taken . months later , pauline levinsons spied her daughter 's photo on the cover of the nazi magazine sonne ins hause . worried their jewish identity would surface as a result , she hurried back to hans ballin , who explained to her that he " wanted to make the nazis ridiculous " —and so the photographer intentionally entered the young hessy into a contest looking for the most beautiful aryan baby , one thought to be judged by joseph goebbels himself . the truth of the baby 's identity never came to light , though hessy was kept out of public sight by her parents , who feared she 'd be recognized . a short time later the family fled germany for latvia , then paris , cuba , and finally the united states . haaretz points out that taft 's story is n't an untold one : in fact , it 's published on the us holocaust memorial museum website . but it 's getting a fresh look after taft recently gave israel 's yad vashem holocaust memorial a copy of the magazine cover . " i feel a little revenge , " the telegraph quotes her as saying . " something like satisfaction . " ( in other nazi news : was hitler a billionaire tax dodger ? )
