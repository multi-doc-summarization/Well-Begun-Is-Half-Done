florida native christopher le cun was out enjoying a day on the boat with his family and best friend on july 12 , 2015 , when the two decided to anchor to a buoy and scuba dive down to mysterious structures faintly visible below . le cun swam up to one that he likened to a building and felt a sudden , strong current . " he got sucked in like a wet noodleâ€”he just , poof , gone , " his diving partner , robert blake , tells wptv . le cun says his surroundings instantly dissolved into " complete darkness " and he struggled to hold onto his mask and regulator while he spent roughly five minutes being sucked through a 1/4-mile-long , 16-foot-wide intake pipe that pulls in 500,000 gallons of water a minute to cool the st. lucie nuclear power plant 's reactors . " you get to do a lot of thinking , " says le cun , who envisioned a turbine chopping him up on the other end . " do i just pull the regulator out of my mouth and just die ? " meanwhile , blake surfaced , horrified , and le cun 's wife called 911 . but le cun survived without intervention , having been spat out into the plant 's cooling pond . le cun , who tells cnn there were no warning signs , is now filing a lawsuit against florida power and light , which issued a statement saying the intake pipe has a protective covering and that le cun " intentionally " swam in . an fpl rep also tells cnn the buoy above the pipe tells people to stay 100 feet away . this is n't the first time a diver has survived the journey : william lamm tells upi his ride through the dark tunnel in 1989 was " devastating . " ( check out why these scuba divers are knowingly risking their lives . )
