how many black forest lattes can the chinese drink ? starbucks is hoping the answer is a lot . ceo howard schultz tells cnnmoney the coffee giant is planning to open more than one new store each day in china over the next five years . the projection to have almost 5,000 stores across the country by 2021 comes despite the fact that growth in china has slowed to its lowest levels in a quarter-century . unphased by that economic forecast , schultz says starbucks is looking far into the future . " i think if you look at the 45-year history of our company ... one of the things that we 've done really well is that we 've always played the long game , " schultz says . he adds that tourists and expats made up the majority of starbucks customers in china only five years ago . " today , " he says , " it 's mostly chinese. " china is the chain 's second-largest market , after the us . schultz says he expects that standing to flip as more chinese discover menu items like cranberry white chocolate mochas . when the first starbucks opened 17 years ago in china , the locals had no idea the addictive value of a cup of joe—or how much better one could be topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce . " we had to educate and teach many chinese about what coffee was—the coffee ritual , what a latte was , " schultz said . " so in the early years , we did not make money . " other businesses like kfc and mcdonald 's have n't fared as well in recent times in the world 's second-largest economy , and both have sought outside investors , per cnnmoney . ( a class-action lawsuit says starbucks lattes lack milk . )
