an initiative to raise the minimum wage in oklahoma city has been thwarted by a new law banning cities in the state from setting their own minimum wages or requirements for vacation days . a petition being circulated in the city called for raising the local minimum wage to $ 10.10—the level president obama is pushing—from the current federal requirement of $ 7.25 , the oklahoman reports . the coalition behind the petition says it is considering a constitutional challenge to the new law . gov . mary fallin , who signed the bill into law , rejected the argument that allowing cities to raise the minimum wage would bring people out of poverty , saying having different minimum wages across the state could scare off businesses and a higher minimum wage would cost jobs . " most minimum wage workers are young , single people working part-time or entry-level jobs , " she said . " many are high school or college students living with their parents in middle-class families . " numerous studies , however , have found this to be untrue , al jazeera notes . a recent economic policy institute report found that almost 90 % of minimum wage workers are over 20 , a quarter have children to support , and more than half work full time .
