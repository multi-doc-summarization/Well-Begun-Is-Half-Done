just as quickly as the bombshell was dropped , it disappeared : fbi director james comey said in a letter sunday to the top republicans on the house oversight committee that after reviewing newly discovered hillary clinton emails , the bureau still believes there 's no reason for clinton to be criminally charged . " based on our review , we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july , " the letter reads , per cnn . clinton spokesperson brian fallon tweeted in response : " we were always confident nothing would cause the july decision to be revisited . now director comey has confirmed it . " twitter went nuts after the news broke ; mediaite and the raw story have a sampling of the reaction , much of it backlash against comey and the fbi . newt gingrich tweeted , " comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant possibly know . " mediaite notes that when news of the review of the new emails was first announced , rush limbaugh had speculated the announcement was just a stunt to distract everyone from the wikileaks release of john podesta 's emails . " [ comey ] is going to make everybody think for the next three or four days that there â€™ s really something to be forthcoming here , " limbaugh said , only for nothing to ultimately come of it . at least one blog says sunday 's letter proves limbaugh correct .
