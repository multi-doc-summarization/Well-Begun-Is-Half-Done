hud proposed a federal mandate thursday that has some smokers fuming : a ban against lighting up in public housing nationwide , the new york times reports . if the law passes , more than 3,100 public housing agencies would prohibit smoking in all living units , indoor common areas , administrative offices , and outdoor spaces near those other areas , the washington post notes . the reason : to keep residents safe from secondhand smoke , cut down on fire risks , and curb building maintenance expenses , per the times . " the argument about secondhand smoke is over , " hud secretary julian castro tells the paper . " it 's harmful . " since hud started encouraging public housing groups to implement bans in 2009 , more than 600 agencies with at least 228,000 units have gone smoke-free , per the postâ€”but now the federal housing department wants to make it universal . a study by the cdc backs up the economics , predicting that a nationwide ban would result in annual savings of $ 153 million . the group that would feel the biggest burn : the nyc housing agency , the nation 's largest public-housing group , with more than 400,000 residents in about 178,000 apartments , per the times . but some worry that , without community support , it will be difficult to enforce , and they do n't think the cops should be involved . " it should be resident-led , " the chairwoman of the nycha tells the times . hud says it will listen to public comments on the potential law before making a final decision .
