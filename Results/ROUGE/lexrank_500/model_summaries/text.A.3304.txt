researchers were perusing an amber market in myanmar when they stumbled across a truly extraordinary specimen , national geographic reports . trapped inside a golden piece of amber—already partially shaped to be sold as jewelry—was a fully feathered section of a dinosaur 's tail . according to the los angeles times , the person selling the amber thought it was some kind of plant . while scientists have found evidence of feathered dinosaurs , not to mention feathered prehistoric birds , this piece of amber is the first time feathers have been found perfectly preserved and attached to what is unmistakably a dinosaur . the find was published thursday in current biology . the tail section is believed to belong to a young , sparrow-sized coelurosaur that lived 99 million years ago . researchers know the tail belongs to a dinosaur because of its articulated vertebrae ; birds have vertebrae that are fused together . and because of the way the features are structured , researchers believe they were useless for flight . it remains unclear exactly what purpose the feathers served , though researchers theorize dinosaurs may have used them for camouflage , regulating their body heat , or signaling to other animals . now that researchers can see how feathers actually appeared on a dinosaur 's body , they hope to learn how they evolved for flight in modern-day birds . they also believe that , given access to myanmar 's amber mines , they may one day find a whole preserved dinosaur .
