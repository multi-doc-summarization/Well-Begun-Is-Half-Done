a bible verse is getting heavy quotation today in a supreme court decision seen as a big victory for the epa and the white house on air pollution . in her majority opinion , ruth bader ginsburg cited the gospel according to john , notes the washington post : “ the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth. ” in this case , she was talking about the wind that bloweth air pollution from coal-fired plants across state lines , and her ruling upheld the epa 's authority to regulate it . the new york times calls it " a major environmental victory for the obama administration , " and scotusblog agrees that it 's a " clear victory for the epa . " the result is that about 1,000 power plants will have to put into place new pollution controls to limit nitrogen and sulfur emissions , reports the guardian . the problem of air pollution blowing from coal-burning states into states downwind—think ohio and kentucky vs. connecticut and new york—is a complex one , ginsburg wrote , and the epa must have the leeway to deal with the " vagaries of the wind . " she thinks the epa got it right with its current formula , though antonin scalia disagreed in his dissent . the case , he wrote , underscores " the major problem that many citizens have with the federal government these days : that they are governed not so much by their elected representatives as by an unelected bureaucracy operating under vague statutory standards . ”
