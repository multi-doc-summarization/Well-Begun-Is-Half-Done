a california ku klux klan rally on saturday ended with three anti-kkk protesters stabbed and five kkk members arrested . but anaheim cops now say those five have been released after evidence shows they acted in self-defense , the los angeles times reports . " the totality of the evidence , including videos , still pictures , and interviews , paints a pretty clear picture as to who the aggressors were , " an anaheim police sergeant says . the demonstration , which the chicago tribune says was meant to be an anti-immigration rally , turned violent from the get-go after six kkk members showed up around noon . witnesses say some of the anti-protesters—who the washington post says numbered in the " several dozen " —started kicking a klansman wearing a " grand dragon " shirt , and soon the stabbings began , including one by a kkk member using the decorative end of a flagpole . " [ the counter-protesters ] were so angry , they would have torn these folks limb from limb , " brian levin , the director of center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university-san bernardino , tells nbc los angeles . levin , who was there to record the rally for research purposes , says he ended up shielding kkk members until police could get there . " i was afraid for their lives . " levin later posted on twitter a video of him asking one of the kkk members : " how do you feel that a jewish person helped save your life today ? " ( the klansman thanked him . ) " regardless of an individual or group 's beliefs or ideologies , they are entitled to live without the fear of physical violence and have the right , under the law , to defend themselves when attacked , " a police statement read , per nbc . the seven counter-protesters who remain jailed are being held on charges of assault with a deadly weapon or elder abuse for attacking a klan member older than 65 . the three people stabbed were in stable condition at a local hospital .
