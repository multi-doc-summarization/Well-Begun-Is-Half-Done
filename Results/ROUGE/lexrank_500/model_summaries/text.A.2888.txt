democratic socialism is nothing to be afraid of unless you think of fdr as a bogeyman , bernie sanders said in a landmark speech at georgetown university on thursday . " democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system [ that ] is corrupt , that we must create an economy that works for all , not just the very wealthy , " he said , per usa today , explaining that he does n't believe that " government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production . " he quoted martin luther king jr. , who said the us has " socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor . " sanders—who said other countries " have done a far better job " in protecting the elderly , the sick , and the poor—likened the inequality in the us today to that of the great depression and noted that fdr was called a socialist for trying to deal with it , cnn reports . " real freedom must include economic security , " he said . " that was roosevelt 's vision 70 years ago . it is my vision today . it is a vision that we have not yet achieved . and it is time that we did . " sanders ' plan is n't true socialism , but it " is really framed to try to bridge the gap between socialism and liberalism—to bring back a framework that was operative during the great depression and world war ii but collapsed soon after , " writes matthew yglesias at vox . ( sanders was very pleased when pope francis praised a " radical catholic activist " during his us visit . )
