for robert schmittner , it was a long time coming . " i did n't rest for 14 years , " the diver tells mexico news daily . schmittner is the director of exploration for the great maya aquifer project , which on jan. 10 discovered the longest underwater cave on earth . divers for the project made the discovery by confirming something that—as per the telegraph—had been long suspected : the 163-mile-long sac actun system and 83-mile-long dos ojos system of mexico 's yucatan peninsula are actually connected . sac actun 's underwater cave system now absorbs dos ojos , becoming the record-setting , 216-mile-long sac actun system , reuters reports . according to national geographic , it 's now 49 miles longer than the previous record holder and could get even bigger as divers continue to seek connections to other flooded cave systems in the area . " this immense cave represents the most important submerged archaeological site in the world , since it has more than a hundred archaeological contexts , " the project 's director , guillermo de anda , says . those contexts include extinct animals and possibly signs of the first american settlers , but also new information about the ancient maya civilization . “ it allows us to appreciate much more clearly how the rituals , the pilgrimage sites , and ultimately the great pre-hispanic settlements that we know emerged , ” de anda tells reuters . sinkholes leading to underground caves had religious significance to the maya , and de anda 's project has found ancient walls , staircases , and paintings in some of the caves that are n't completely flooded . ( a skeleton found in an underwater cave is one of the oldest in the americas , so it 's too bad thieves stole it . )
