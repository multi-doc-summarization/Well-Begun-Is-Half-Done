amanda knox may yet be extradited , but for now , the 27-year-old has a new gig : writing for a small seattle newspaper . patrick robinson , web editor for the west seattle herald , tells the daily beast that knox has been freelancing for a " few months , " covering human interest stories and high school playsâ€”in her recent review , knox philosophizes about how rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead questions " everything one takes for granted : time , space , identity , reality , fate , freedom . " " amanda 's a very bright , very capable , highly qualified writer , " says robinson , admitting that she used a pen name at first . " she 's certainly been through [ a ] lot and been very easy to work with and very interested and eager in doing stories . " as for italy 's ongoing attempt to get knox back overseas , robinson says it has " little to nothing " to do with her standing at the herald : " why not give her the opportunity to be an actual human being versus a celebrity ? " ( knox 's ex-boyfriend changed his story over the summer . )
