mcdonald 's mighty wings simply did n't fly with customers , and now the chain appears to just want to break even on them . reports in december predicted that a promotion would be coming , and it 's here : instead of selling the wings at a buck each , mcdonald 's is now offering them at a rate of five for $ 3 , or 60 cents per wing , businessweek reports . that price will result in either breaking even or a small loss , says an analyst . but " they ’ ve paid for those wings . if they don ’ t sell ( them ) , they would have to eat the entire loss . " a mcdonald 's rep indicates to usa today that atlanta and chicago might bear some of the blame for the flop : " while pricing during the national advertised launch was consistent with the test markets ( atlanta and chicago ) , those markets were heavy wing markets which did not reflect some of our broader customers feelings towards the price and spice of the wings . " now , the discount will continue " until supply runs out " —and there 's a big supply—says the rep , who notes that while the price has changed , the level of spice has not , though there 's now " more awareness " of it .
