donald trump 's campaign may be about to hit its first big test . club for growth will drop $ 1 million on anti-trump ads in iowa , to begin airing tomorrow , reports the wall street journal . the anti-tax , anti-spending group has already aired one ad that attacks trump 's " very liberal " record and labels him " just another politician . " why the hate ? vox explains the group , which falls to the far right on economic issues , has been feuding with trump since he announced his run . though trump 's views on immigration make him seem like a far-right candidate , his promises of " no cuts to social security , medicare , and medicaid " and higher taxes on the wealthy place him closer to the left . " when republicans run in primaries with a platform like trump 's , the club tries to take them down , " reports vox . " that 's its whole reason for being . " the club 's president david mcintosh wasted no time in attacking trump back in june , noting he was " not a serious candidate . " but things heated up weeks later when trump shared a letter from mcintosh asking for a $ 1 million contribution . trump has suggested the " phony " group is attacking him because he refused to comply . " he 'll say anything to get elected , and then he 'll do just the opposite when he 's in office , " a club for growth rep says , adding the group may team with other conservative or republican groups against trump . " this is the beginning . " " if nothing else , the ads will provide the latest test case for whether the former reality tv star is really as immune to the laws of politics as he currently appears to be , " notes slate . " for republicans and their conservative allies who worry that trump is inflicting daily damage to their eventual nominee 's 2016 chances , $ 1 million is small price to pay to find that out . "
