" that 's the thing , i mean . i like all of them . you know . " he says it is n't hard " at all " to lure children , and he waits for one to " give you the glance . " " we just start sharing stories , and then , you know , we get a little closer , and a little closer , and a little closer , and before you know it , it just starts to happen , " he says . herman-walrond—who says she gained fogle 's trust in order to bring him down , and that the experience has left her scarred—told dr. phil that she had made subway aware of the recordings in 2011 , though the chain says the complaint was made via its website and did not mention anything illegal , people reports .
