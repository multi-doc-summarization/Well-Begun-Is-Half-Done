a backcountry skier in the upper reaches of alaska died after he was buried in a surprise avalanche in the rainbow mountains on saturday evening , the alaska dispatch news reports . eric peterson , 35 , and his friend , 63-year-old michael hopper , had been enjoying their late-afternoon ski when the two heard a " whoomp " sound from about 20 feet above them , an alaska state troopers dispatch noted yesterday . the snow barreled down the mountain and covered the two men , but hopper was able to extricate himself after two to three hours of strenuous digging . he found his friend 's glove and started clawing through the snow until he got to peterson 's body , at which point he hightailed it to the richardson highway to find help . david savage , a volunteer at the lodge at black rapids about 20 miles away , says hopper is the owner of the lodge and very familiar with weather conditions in that neck of the woods , spending plenty of time in the mountains there and even holding an avalanche safety course once a year at the lodge , ktuu reports . " mike is very educated in those mountains , " savage says , adding , " those mountains can be unpredictable . " indeed , the trooper dispatch noted that where hopper and peterson were skiing " is widely unstable and continuing to deteriorate with the additional heavy snowfall , " which is holding up efforts to recover peterson 's body . his family has been notified of his death , ktuu notes . ( avalanches could possibly halt future everest attempts . )
