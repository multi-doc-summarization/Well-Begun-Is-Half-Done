donald trump 's antics last week , including attacks on a disabled reporter and questionable recollections of 9/11 , may have been the last straw for some supporters , the latest reuters/ipsos poll suggests . the poll put his support at 31 % for the week ending on nov. 27 , down from 43 % a week earlier , marking trump 's biggest poll drop since he became the front-runner in july , though ben carson is n't closing the gap : his numbers have also dropped and he is now a distant second at 15 % , according to the poll , with marco rubio and ted cruz tied for third at 8 % apiece and jeb bush fifth at 7 % . but even with the latest fall , trump 's staying power has surprised republican insiders , who now admit that he could win early voting states including iowa , new hampshire , and south carolina . " i do not think the media or the party establishment have a real grasp on how deep the anger and frustration is around the country , " a south carolina republican tells politico . " i still do not know if he can sustain it into the new yearâ€”but after the paris attacks , his stance on illegal immigration and unverified people coming into our nation has real impact .
