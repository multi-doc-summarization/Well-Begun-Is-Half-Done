now that he 's out of the white house , lost his main financial backer , and been ousted from breitbart news , what comes next for steve bannon ? that remained very much unclear on wednesday , although one thing was clarified : " fox news will not be hiring steve bannon , " a network spokesperson tells the hill . that 's not a huge surprise , notes adweek , which points out a passage in the new book by michael wolff ( a co-founder of newser ) that makes clear bannon and fox honcho rupert murdoch are not on great terms— " not least because murdoch had donald trump 's ear . " bannon reportedly does n't think murdoch understands us politics and told trump as much . more on the bannon fallout : the midterms : bannon had vowed to lead a slate of anti-establishment candidates into office this year , " but it 's unclear—and unlikely—that bannon could continue to be a player in politics during this year 's midterms without major donors behind him and after being disavowed by the president , writes rosie gray at the atlantic . what 's more , bannon also has lost his radio show on siriusxm , because the company 's contract was with breitbart , not bannon . his mistake : at cnn , chris cillizza thinks bannon made one huge mistake in regard to trump , who brought him from the political fringe to the white house . " somewhere along the way , bannon forgot that trump was the boss and he was the underling , " writes cillizza . " everything that happened after that was sadly predictable . "
