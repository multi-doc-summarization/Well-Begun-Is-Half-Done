an earthquake struck wyoming two years ago that made little sense , scientifically speaking—but experts seem closer to solving the mystery , the bbc reports . called the wind river earthquake , it hit with 4.7 magnitude in an area that rarely sees such seismic power . hardly surprising , since the wind river area has little tectonic-plate movement that would normally trigger such an earthquake . but a new study in earth and planetary science letters says the quake may not have originated with tectonic plates grinding against each other at all . the wind river earthquake may have started deeper , in what the bbc calls " the earth ’ s hotter and more viscous mantle . " such a quake might be caused by crust falling into the mantle , which lies between the earth 's higher crust and deeper core . these deeper quakes remain " a highly controversial topic , " the scientists write , but this one " occurred well within the mantle , and likely over 20 km [ 12.4 miles ] deeper than the base of the crust . " if true , the finding makes the wind river earthquake one of the three deepest ever recorded in the area . still , some things do n't fit : while such deep quakes can occur in volcanic regions , when fluid or magma flows in the earth 's mantle , they usually affect a smaller area ; the wind river quake ruptured nearly 11 million square feet , notes geology in motion . and wind river is noticeably far from the nearest volcanic region . so what 's up ? perhaps the mantle was so brittle that it failed and triggered the quake , say researchers , who admit that the causes remain debatable .
