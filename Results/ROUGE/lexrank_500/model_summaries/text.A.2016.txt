valentina maureira 's brother died from cystic fibrosis when he was 6 . the 14-year-old has the same inherited disease and was told she has a life expectancy of 17 , reports cnn . except valentina does n't want to live that long . the chilean teen posted a now-viral video to facebook late last month , a plea to president michelle bachelet that she be allowed to end her life . " i am tired of living with this sickness , " which causes damage to the lungs and digestive system , valentina explains . " please authorize an injection so i can sleep forever . " but a rep for bachelet on thursday explained " it 's impossible to grant her wish " due to chilean law , which bars euthanasia and does n't allow a government official to circumvent that . still , the president herself , who is also a pediatrician , did visit valentina for more than an hour last week ; the two posed for a selfie . the president 's rep explained " we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions . " as for her medical condition , the universidad catolica clinic in santiago describes it as stable and notes she is not facing , as reuters puts it , any " immediately life-threatening conditions . " but her father described a painful existence : " she has already had five operations ... which have caused her a lot of suffering . it was promised that things would get better , but for her it was worse . " she suffers from persistent headaches and vomiting as well . in an interview with the ap , he says he " cried through the night " after learning what valentina wanted , " but i have to respect her decision because she 's the one who 's suffering this illness . " ( one country has made euthanasia legal for kids . )
