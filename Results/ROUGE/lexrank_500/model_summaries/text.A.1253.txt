matt berical noticed that his restless nights always ended with him facing right , while his girlfriend mostly reported nightmares after waking on her left . " is there , i wondered , a correlation between bad dreams and sleeping position ? " writes berical at van winkles . he dug up a 2004 study that asked 45 men and 18 women to sleep on one side or the other and fill out a popular sleep questionnaire called the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( which evaluates sleep using seven factors , including " subjective sleep quality , " sleep duration , and use of sleep drugs ) . the study found that just 14.6 % of right-side sleepers reported bad dreams , compared to 40.9 % of their lefty counterparts . right-side sleepers also reported more dreams with feelings of safety or relief , but had worse-quality sleep than left-siders . berical also found a 2012 study that analyzed the sleep positions and dreams of over 670 students . the study found that face-down sleepers had more positive and vivid dreams , which were more often about " sex , " " being unable to move , " " being tied up , " or " being locked up , " van winkles reports . the researcher behind that study , calvin kai-ching yu , concluded that " the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world , " adding that " the unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense , and even make use of , the external stimuli . " berical 's conclusion ? " it can â€™ t hurt to roll your loved one over when you sense a nightmare coming on , " he writes . " assuming you can avoid the flailing arms , that is . " ( it turns out that humans are incredibly good at sleeping . )
