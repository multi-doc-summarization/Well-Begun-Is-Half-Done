michael lohan , that paragon of celebrity fatherhood , is engaged to none other than kate major , the former star reporter who famously—and oh-so-briefly—dated jon gosselin . “ i 'm very traditional , so i wanted him to talk to my father , ” major tells people ; lohan got kate 's dad ’ s blessing during an easter visit—in a hot tub , no less . both say they are “ ecstatic , ” lohan in particular because major “ doesn ’ t come with baggage. ” lohan tells us he wanted to wait for the “ situation with lindsay to resolve ” before making the announcement ; no word , though , on said resolution . the wedding will likely be later this year at oheka castle in new york , major says , adding that the couple ’ s 23-year age difference “ has never been an issue. ” and no , gosselin hasn ’ t sent his congratulations , she says : “ jon and i don ’ t speak . ”
