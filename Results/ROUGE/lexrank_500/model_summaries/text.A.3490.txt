uk scientists have made a nifty , unprecedented discovery about scotland 's loch ness , but prepare to be a little disappointed . they found that tides from the nearby north sea caused the land underneath the lake to shift ever so slightly , resulting in a change in depth of 0.06 inches at either end , depending on whether the tide was in or out . one professor likened it to a carpenter 's bubble level , notes the bbc . " i have described loch ness as the largest spirit level in the world , " he says . " if you were on a boat in the middle of the loch , you certainly would n't notice it , " adds another . " but a tide like this has never been observed in a western european lake before . " the scientists used underwater pressure sensors at various spots in the lake to get the astonishing accuracy , explains discovery . the hope is that the method can be used at other lakes to shed more light on how oceans affect the earth 's crust . ( the study , here , fails to mention the elephant in the room , but a fark headline suspects that the lake level changes because nessie is getting out to towel off . )
