an orca who spent more than a week carrying her calf following its july 24 death now has some help . other orcas in the pod swimming through pacific northwest waters near the us-canada border are taking turns carrying the corpse after the effort caused the 20-year-old mother known as j35 to fall behind with labored breathing . trailing the main pod with improved breathing , j35 was seen with the now-decomposing corpse thursday in the strait of juan de fuca alongside immediate family members who are keeping her fed , per kcpq . but " because we 've seen her so many times without the calf , we know that somebody else has it , " jenny atkinson of san juan island 's whale museum tells the cbc . the same pod held a similar display 15 years ago , but this is the longest period of orca mourning on record , per national geographic . audio recordings indeed suggest the pod is using calls and whistles perhaps related to mourning . they sound " more like a very urgent call , " says atkinson . " i think that what you 're seeing is the depth of importance of this calf and the grief of the mother and the family . " it 's a tight-knit one : there are just 75 orcas in three pods in the southern resident population around oregon , washington , and vancouver island , down from 83 in 2016 . none have seen a successful birth since 2015 . amid indications a 4-year-old orca might be starving , an expert describes " at most five more years " in which to try to birth viable offspring . declines in chinook salmon have hit the population hard , per nat geo . canada hopes to lend a hand by limiting catches of the fish , while experts hope a necropsy will reveal how j35 's calf died , per ctv news . of course , it must be abandoned first .
