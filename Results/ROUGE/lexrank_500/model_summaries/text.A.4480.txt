looks like the boeing 787 's fire issues are n't entirely behind it . a parked dreamliner , owned by ethiopian airlines , caught fire today at heathrow airport , prompting a suspension of all arrivals and departures to the london airport , the bbc reports . no passengers were aboard , no injuries have been reported , and the airport has since reopened . but the incident is likely to raise more doubts about the benighted dreamlinerâ€”and sure enough , boeing 's stock plunged on the news , the ap reports . and as if that was n't enough bad news for the plane maker , later another 787 flying from manchester to the us had to turn around after encountering an unspecified mechanical failure . all 126 passengers aboard have now disembarked safely . the plane 's operator , thompson airways , describes the emergency landing as a " precautionary measure .
