" as if this was n't repulsive enough , davis allegedly possessed and distributed utterly explicit images of innocent infants and toddlers being sexually abused by adults . " us attorney geoffrey s. berman calls the development " as unfathomable as it is sickening " given that davis has rubbed elbows with angelina jolie , served as a youth ambassador for the un special representative on sexual violence in conflict , and is now leading the international campaign to stop rape and gender violence . davis , who last year described being " tormented by the recollection of my childhood sex abuse " and spoke out about child rape in war zones in a 2014 huffington post op-ed , could face up to 70 years in prison .
