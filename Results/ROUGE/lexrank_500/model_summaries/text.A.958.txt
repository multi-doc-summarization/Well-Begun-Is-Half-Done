the drug company ceo called the " most hated man in america right now " by the bbc says he 's misunderstoodâ€”but that he 'll lower the price of daraprim in response to the firestorm of criticism . " there were mistakes made with respect to helping people understand why we took this action , " turing pharmaceuticals chief martin shkreli , who raised the price of the toxoplasmosis drug from $ 13.50 a pill to $ 750 , tells nbc news . " i think that it makes sense to lower the price in response to the anger that was felt by people . " the 32-year-old former hedge fund boss says it 's " very easy to see a large drug price increase and say , 'gosh , those people must be gouging , ' " but that drug pricing is " very hard stuff " for people to understand . shkreli admits that the drug is cheap to make , but he says the price has to cover " the quality control , the regulatory costs , and all of the other things that come with having a drug company . " shkreli is an " odious pharma executive straight out of central casting , " but his company is far from the only one buying up relatively obscure drugs and massively increasing the price , writes dan diamond at forbes . the same thing has happened to dozens of other drugs over the last year , and while media attention forced shkreli to back down , " the hard part is achieving lasting reform , " he writes . ( a huge increase in the price of a tuberculosis drug has also been rolled back . )
