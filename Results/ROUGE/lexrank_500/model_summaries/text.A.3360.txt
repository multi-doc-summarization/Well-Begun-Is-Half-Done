a notable change for working saudi arabians : the weekend will now come a day later . its people had enjoyed a thursday-friday weekend , but oman 's recent switch to friday-saturday made saudi arabia the odd man out among the six-nation gulf cooperation council . the change to a friday weekend start , described by reuters as a " surprise , " is effective this week , per an order issued yesterday by king abdullah . businesses are pleased : " it will increase interface with the rest of the world , " says a former oil exec , and a riyadh-based strategist notes that the move puts an end to " having just three working days aligned with the rest of the world . " bloomberg sees something more behind the shift : the saudi stock market . " it â€™ s not official , but this is one of the things [ saudi arabia ] needed to do to open the markets for foreign investors , " says a dubai fund manager . bloomberg reports that deutsche bank and hsbc have previously predicted that foreign investors could be given direct access to the country 's $ 400 billion stock market as early as 2014 .
