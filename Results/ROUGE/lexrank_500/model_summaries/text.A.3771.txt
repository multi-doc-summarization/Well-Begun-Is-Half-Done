a researcher calls it " a decades-old mystery that has been the holy grail of paleontology " : what , exactly , dickinsonia was . it 's one of a group of lifeforms called the ediacaran biota , which the bbc describes as the " first complex multi-cellular organisms to appear on earth . " but for decades they 've defied definitive classification , with scientists suggesting they could be everything from lichen to giant single-celled amoeba to " evolutionary dead-ends . " now , an answer : dickinsonia is an animal that dates back 558 million years , making it the earliest confirmed one in the geological record . that conclusion comes thanks to fat , reports phys.org . ilya bobrovskiy of australian national university discovered a dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the white sea in northwest russia , in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter . the fossil was superbly preserved , so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it . " the fossil fat molecules that we 've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago , millions of years earlier than previously thought , " says anu professor jochen brocks , co-author of the paper on the discovery , which was published in science . the cambrian explosion that gave rise to modern animal groups did n't happen for another 20 million years or so . as for the oval dickinsonia 's appearance , the bbc describes it as possibly bearing " a superficial resemblance to a segmented jellyfish . " national geographic delves into the difficulty of studying ediacarans , who had no shells or bones to leave behind and whose " squishy bodies have long since decayed . " read more on how the team overcame that here .
