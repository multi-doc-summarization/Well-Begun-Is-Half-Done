hillary clinton 's team has—somewhat belatedly—clarified that every one of the approximately 32,000 emails deemed " private " and deleted was opened and read before being chucked . the clarification comes a few days after a time story claimed that the review involved searching by keywords and not checking every email . a clinton spokesman blames the confusion on a fact sheet provided after a press conference last week , which mentioned keyword searches . " we simply took for granted that reading every single email came across as the most important , fundamental , and exhaustive step that was performed , " he said in a statement to fox . " the fact sheet should have been clearer in stating that every email was read . " but while the 31,830 emails appear to be gone forever , it does n't look like the controversy for clinton is going to go away anytime soon . house speaker john boehner plans to announce a new probe this week into clinton 's email use , including the deletions , according to abc news , which cites " top house republicans . " and it 's not just clinton 's emails that are gone : the state department has admitted that routine archiving of the inboxes of senior officials only began last month . " it 's very troubling , " a spokesman for the national security archive group tells politico . " people in the community of record-keepers and historians had known that our history was at risk for a long time . "
