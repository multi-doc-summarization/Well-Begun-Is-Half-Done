a senior chinese official warned today that the us is in for a “ trade war ” if it enacts a senate bill that would punish china for artificially keeping its currency low . the bill “ in no way represents the reality of the economic and trade relationship between china and the us , ” a chinese foreign minister tells reuters . “ the only result would be a trade war … that would be a lose-lose situation for both sides . " the bill , which seems all but certain to pass the senate , would place a tariff on imports from countries that purposely hold down their currency—something china has long been accused of doing to give its manufacturers a competitive edge overseas . but the white house says the bill may violate international trade rules , and john boehner called it “ dangerous , ” even as pressure mounts for him to bring it to the floor , the hill reports .
