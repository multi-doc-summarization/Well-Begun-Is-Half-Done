the portland teen accused of peeing in a city reservoir on wednesday insists he did n't do it—in a relatively nsfw defense . " yeah , it 's f -- -ing retarded , dude , " 18-year-old dallas swonger tells vocativ in what the site calls an " expletive-filled interview " given as swonger smoked a newport cigarette . " i did n't piss in the f -- -ing water . " he explains that he did urinate , after a night of skateboarding at mount tabor park , but he did so against the wall of the reservoir , not into the reservoir . " i was like , 'dudes i have to piss so bad . ' so i just went over to the wall . i leaned up against the wall and pissed on it . right there on the wall , dude . i don ’ t know else how to describe it . " officials beg to differ ( a water bureau official got very specific about it , saying that surveillance video showed swonger making sure " to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars " ) , and thus decided to dump 38 million gallons of water , but swonger notes that even if his urine had made it into the water , he does n't see what the big deal is . " dude , i ’ ve seen dead birds in there . during the summer time i 've see hella dead animals in there . like dead squirrels and s -- - . i mean , really , dude ? " vocativ also got amusing quotes from swonger 's mom ( " i ’ m sorry , he just graduated from high school . he ’ s trying to get his stuff together " ) and one of the friends skateboarding with him that night ( " he just doesn ’ t make the best decisions . honestly , he has the potential to do really good " ) . possible criminal charges are still pending , the oregonian notes . the paper also reports that the water tested clean of urine-related toxins , but all 38 million gallons will still be dumped .
