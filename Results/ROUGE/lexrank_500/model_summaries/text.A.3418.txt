are we one step closer to jurassic park ? probably not , but researchers do believe they 've found the first ever example of fossilized brain tissue from a dinosaur , national geographic reports . the fossil was found on an english beach in 2004 , but its unique trait—mineralized pieces of brain tissue—was announced in a study thursday . " the chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small , so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing , " phys.org quotes study coauthor alex liu as saying . researchers believe the dinosaur , a relative of the iguanodon , sank upside down into a pond after it died . the pond water " essentially pickled " the dinosaur 's brain , and the pickled tissue was eventually replaced by minerals . the outer millimeter of the fossil seems to include mineralized blood vessels and bits of the membrane that covered the brain , npr reports . researchers believe it may also contain mineralized pieces of the brain itself . “ that is the nearest i suspect we ’ re ever going to get to the whole [ brain ] , ” paleontologist david norman tells natgeo . one result of the new discovery : researchers say it may show dinosaurs were smarter than we 've been giving them credit for . in modern reptiles , the brain does n't take up the entire brain case in the skull . that appears not to have been the case in this dinosaur , meaning it may have had a larger brain than previously believed . norman says it appears the dino was at least as smart as a modern crocodile .
