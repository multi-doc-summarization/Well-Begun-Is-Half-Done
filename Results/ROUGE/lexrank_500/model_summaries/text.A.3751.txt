the " simplest of drugs " is in short supply at hospitals around the country , causing crucial surgeries and other treatments to be reprioritized , and it 's a cheap drug whose main ingredient may be found in your own pantry , the new york times reports . that drug is sodium bicarbonate solution , aka baking soda , which is used in chemo regimens , as a poison antidote , and to help patients whose blood has veered into acidic ranges , among other uses . but the nation 's two lone suppliers , pfizer and amphastar , are suddenly unable to give medical facilities what they need , causing those facilities to hoard what 's left in their own cabinets . " does the immediate need of a patient outweigh the expected need of a patient ? " says the head pharmacist at a hospital in mobile , ala. , calling it a " medical and ethical question that goes beyond anything i 've had to experience before . " supply problems can arise when things go wrong at the factory level or when suppliers of the raw ingredients have issues , leaving hospital officials irritated at the short notice they receive about a dearth . right now on the fda website , there are dozens of drugs said to be " currently in shortage , " many of them critical generic injectables . some pharmacy officials even harbor suspicions that manufacturers are n't investing enough to ensure adequate supplies since , per ars technica , generic drugs are n't the moneymakers . some hospitals have " compounding pharmacies " where they whip up their own generic drugs , but that does n't solve the larger problem . " it is unbelievably frustrating , " a university of utah drug shortage expert tells the times , which notes pfizer and amphastar ca n't guarantee more sodium bicarbonate supplies until at least june and maybe not until august in some cases . ( the " cartels " some think control the market . )
