andrew shirvell is a “ concerned alumnus ” of the university of michigan , and oh—he also happens to be the assistant attorney general of michigan , which makes his extracurricular hobby even more disturbing . for almost six months , shirvell has been running “ chris armstrong watch , ” a blog campaigning against chris armstrong , the university of michigan ’ s first openly gay student assembly president . samples of shirvell ’ s opinions : a picture of armstrong with a swastika pasted over it , a post calling him a “ racist , elitist liar , ” and a comment that he ’ s “ satan ’ s representative on the student assembly. ” shirvell accuses armstrong of recruiting incoming students “ to join the homosexual ‘ lifestyle , ’ ” and even convincing one “ previously conservative student ” to do just that ( by seducing him ) . he also claims armstrong hosted a gay orgy in his dorm room , among other things , cnn reports . shirvell says he writes the blog during non-work hours ; even so , the attorney general issued a statement referring to shirvell ’ s “ immaturity and lack of judgment. ” speaking to anderson cooper recently , shirvell offered no apologies . watch the interview in the gallery .
