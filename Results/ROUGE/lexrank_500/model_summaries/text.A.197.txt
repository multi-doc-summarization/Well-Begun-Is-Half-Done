when the weather got bad at louisiana 's t-bois blues festival on friday night , jacqui stavis , two other women , and a labrador retriever sought shelter in a small tent . but tragedy struck when lightning hit the tent , killing the 28-year-old and the dog and injuring the other two women , the lafourche parish sheriff 's office says in a statement picked up by buzzfeed . the other two women , ages 30 and 24 and also from new orleans like stavis , were hospitalized with " injuries commonly associated with electric shock . " stavis , who grew up in new england , new york , and wisconsin , had always been fascinated by new orleans , and moved there in 2009 , friends tell the advocate . " she just dove into the culture of new orleans , just became a part of it , " one friend says . " the falgout family is deeply saddened by the tragic event that occurred this weekend at t-bois blues festival , " festival organizers posted on facebook sunday . ( the festival is held on an alligator and crawfish farm owned by the falgout family , and " alligator mike " falgout produces the festival . ) " every attendee of this small festival is part of the t-bois family , and we feel as though we lost a family member this weekend . our thoughts and prayers go out to the stavis family and all those who love jacqui . " another post on the page notes that stavis changed her cover photo to a scene from the festival ( it appears to be from a past year 's festival ) while she was in attendance this year . nola.com rounds up other facebook tributes to stavis , who worked as a massage therapist .
