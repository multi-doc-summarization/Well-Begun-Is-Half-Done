looking for the perfect cheese for the ultimately gooey , perfectly melted grilled cheese sandwich ? good news : scientists with the american chemical society have put out a three-minute video from the society 's " reactions " series on youtube all about that very subject . and the winners are ... gouda , gruyére , or manchego , with mild cheeses melting more beautifully than sharp . it 's all about how casein proteins clump together ( the resulting spheres are called micelles ) when cheese melts . these micelles , which are held together by calcium and are gloriously fatty , are negatively charged , meaning those tiny balls bounce apart . add lactic acid , however , which goes up the longer a cheese ages , and those micelles smack together , trapping water and getting all gooey , reports consumerist . but wait , there 's more . the older the cheese , the more lactic acid , which in turn lowers the cheese 's ph—thus sharper cheeses have a lower ph and mild ones a higher ph . the ideal ph , in fact , is right between 5.3 and 5.5 , with cheese of lower ph releasing their oils when heated and getting clumpy . this is why gouda , gruyére , or manchego are ideal but on the milder side ; if they age too long and become sharper , the ph dips too low and the cheese breaks down more easily , meaning you could end up with a curdled mess while heating it .
