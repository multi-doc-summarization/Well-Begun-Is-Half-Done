" she has a natural affinity for police officers and law enforcement types , and at the same time , she is aware of the incredible number of complaints against the baltimore city police department , " says an attorney who knows her . " it was important to have somebody who was willing to look at it from both sides , and marilyn mosby fits the bill . " mosby 's office released a statement emphasizing that it will conduct its own investigation into gray 's death and not just rely on the police report . one new wrinkle : police revealed that the van carrying gray made an additional , previously undisclosed , stop on the way to the police station , though the reason and significance are n't clear . the ap says the van stopped at " a desolate intersection with three vacant lots and a corner store . " ( earlier , another prisoner in the van suggested that gray was trying to injure himself , at least according to a police document cited by the washington post . )
