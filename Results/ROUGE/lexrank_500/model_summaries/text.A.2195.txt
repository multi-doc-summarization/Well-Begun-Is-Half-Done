a jawbone found in romania more than a decade ago provides the first genetic evidence that humans and neanderthals knocked boots in europe before the latter disappeared between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago . scientists who came across the bone of one of the earliest modern humans in europe in a cave known as pestera cu oase noticed it had both modern human and neanderthal traits . now , a study of the bone 's dna—made possible by recent technological advances—explains why . " the sample is more closely related to neanderthals than any other modern human we 've ever looked at before , " harvard researcher david reich explains in a press release . " we estimate that 6 % to 9 % of its genome is from neanderthals . this is an unprecedented amount . " in comparison , all people except sub-saharan africans share 1 % to 4 % of their dna with neanderthals today . dna in the fossil , which is 37,000 to 42,000 years old , suggests the oase individual had a neanderthal ancestor four to six generations back , reports reuters . in other words , a great-great-grandparent might 've been a neanderthal , notes livescience . that shows interbreeding occurred far more recently than scientists had guessed ; they initially thought interbreeding took place only in the middle east between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago . " it 's an incredibly unexpected thing , " reich says . " in the last few years , we 've documented interbreeding between neanderthals and modern humans , but we never thought we 'd be so lucky to find someone so close to that event . " you are n't likely to share any dna with the jawbone 's owner , however . reich says the hunter-gatherer was from a " pioneer population " that entered europe but " did n't give rise to the later population . " ( the oldest neanderthal dna is some 150,000 years old . )
