" you kind of think a little bit and try to understand the concept of how big it really is , " he said . " it 's amazing . we kind of felt like it wanted to be found . " the captain says that after the boat was hoisted aboard , he googled " missing fisherman " and was stunned to discover that it belonged to austin stephanos and perry cohen , both 14 , who left jupiter inlet , fla. , in it and never returned . melvaer tells the post that he and his crew treated the boat , which is being shipped to florida , as very precious cargo . " i 'm a parent myself , so i can identify with the situation , " he says . " i 've been boating since i was a kid as well . " items found inside the boat , including austin 's iphone , have been returned to the us . austin 's father , blu stephanos , said in a statement that he received a heartfelt message from the captain , explaining that he 's the father of three boys and was deeply affected by the story of austin and perry . " he went on to say that , since recovering the boat , his entire crew had thought a lot about the boys and said , ' i think they will follow us in our hearts and minds for the rest of our lives , ' " stephanos said .
