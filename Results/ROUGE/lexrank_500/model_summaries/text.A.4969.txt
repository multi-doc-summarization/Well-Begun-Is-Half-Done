sarah palin took time out from her war with new neighbor joe mcginniss—now safely behind a mile-high fence—to launch a facebook attack on president obama , who she says passed the buck in his press conference on the gulf oil spill and has n't gotten federal agencies involved fast enough . " his lack of executive experience might explain this because he is apparently unaware that it ’ s his job as a chief executive to make sure they do their jobs and help solve problems . " could be read as a cute rejoinder to press secretary robert gibbs suggesting sweetly on sunday that palin , who had charged that obama was in bed with bp because of campaign contributions , apparently " was n't paying a whole lot of attention " during the election , and might want to get " slightly more informed as to what 's going on in and around drilling in this country . " palin goes on to slam obama 's decision to suspend drilling off the coast of alaska , and says it shows how much the president has to learn . " please learn that we must have domestic energy development , you must stop looking backward and blaming bush , and we must all work together to 'plug the d # * ! hole . ' ”
