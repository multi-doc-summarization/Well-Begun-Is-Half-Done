reclusive heiress huguette clark 's life was shrouded in mystery—and now , more intrigue . a new york city judge yesterday suspended her lawyer and accountant from administering her $ 400 million estate—taking away the $ 8 million payday they 'd each receive as executors . though both deny wrongdoing , the surrogate court judge pointed to claims made by the new york public administrator 's office earlier in the week : it found evidence that the pair engaged in tax fraud that led to $ 90 million in unpaid federal gift taxes and penalties . attorney wallace bock and cpa irving h. kamsler should be removed " by reason of their dishonesty , improvidence , waste , and want of understanding , " read the office 's court filing , as reported by the los angeles times . among the allegations made by the public administrator—who was court-appointed to serve as a third executor—as reported by msnbc : that bock and kamsler charged clark for filing tax returns they never filed ; did n't file federal gift tax returns between 1997 and 2003 , and paid only $ 7.5 million of the $ 41.5 million in taxes due on the gifts made during that period ; and never told clark about the unpaid taxes , or the penalties and interest that were accruing ( her tax bill was jumping $ 9,000 per day ) ... among other lies made to the irs and the public administrator . kamsler ( who msnbc notes is a registered sex offender ) resigned as executor on wednesday .
