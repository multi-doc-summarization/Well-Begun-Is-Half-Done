chris christie may have just become the republican frontrunner among kids , though he likely irked michelle obama in the process . while campaigning in iowa on monday , the new jersey governor fielded a complaint from an 11-year-old boy who said pizza and crispitos , a kind of crispy taco , have vanished from his school cafeteria in recent years , reports usa today . if christie is elected president , kids can eat " whatever you want to eat " at school , the governor responded , per abc news . " i want people to eat healthier â€¦ but in the end , it 's your choice , " he added . " i do n't care what you 're eating for lunch every day . i really do n't . " " the first lady has no business being involved in this , " he added . " using the government to mandate her point of view on what people should be eating every day is none of her business . " however , cbs news uncovered a quote from a 2011 interview in which christie said he supported obama 's clean eating initiative . " i think it 's a really good goal to encourage kids to eat better , " christie told the telegraph . " i do n't want the government deciding what you can and what you ca n't eat , " but " mrs. obama being out there encouraging people in a positive way to eat well and to exercise and to be healthy , i do n't have a problem with that .
