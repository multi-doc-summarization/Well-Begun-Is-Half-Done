in 1783 , after the british soldiers left new york city , george washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the bull 's head tavern . now a preservationist thinks he 's found the historic siteâ€”and if he 's right , it could be the oldest building in manhattan . adam woodward had heard that the building at 50 bowery , currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up , might have " the bull 's head 's structure , cellar , bones , " he tells cbs new york . so he searched the basement , and " found myself in what i am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern , " he says . specifically , he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the colonial era . since that time , the building has housed a drugstore , a chinese restaurant , and a beer garden , among other things . now he 's hoping city officials will preserve the site , saying , " what an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge . " a historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern , and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the landmarks preservation commission , eater ny reports . but ultimately , the commission says , it " can not require the owner to conduct archaeology , " so a lot depends on him . he 's apparently not talking yet ; the new york times could n't get hold of him .
