the fda last week banned the use of a chemical from soap , but not from the nation ’ s top-selling toothpaste . why ? the new york times reports it was because colgate-palmolive convinced the fda that the benefits of triclosan are greater than the risks . toothpaste containing the chemical " demonstrated to be effective at reducing plaque and gingivitis , " an fda spokeswoman said . the decision came after the agency announced that there was not enough evidence to prove that antibacterial soap containing triclosan was any better " at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water . " worse , long-term use of the soap , the agency said in a statement , " has raised the question of potential negative effects on your health . " scientists have long raised concerns that prolonged exposure to germ-fighters could result in strains of resistant bacteria . the only toothpaste in the us that contains triclosan colgate total , the times reports . colgate-palmolive insists that rigorous testing has shown the toothpaste is safe . " the full weight of scientific evidence amassed over 25 years continues to support the safety and efficacy of colgate total , " spokesman mike dipiazza told the paper . but critics questioned the fda ’ s logic . " we put soap on our hands , and a small amount gets into our body , " said rolf halden , an expert at arizona state university who has studied triclosan . he said that with exposure through the gums " chemicals get rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream . " ( the feds have also targeted fluoride . )
