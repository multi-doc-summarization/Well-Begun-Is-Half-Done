could " north colorado " soon become the 51st state ? voters in 11 northern colorado counties will get to weigh in tomorrow on whether or not they 'd like to secede from the state , cnn reports . ten of the conservative-leaning counties would become north colorado , while the other would become a panhandle for wyoming . of course , cnn thinks there 's zero chance this actually happens , because the entire state and congress would have to vote to approve the move . but it still stands as one of the more intriguing ballot measures up for vote tomorrow . others include : colorado is also voting on whether or not to impose a 15 % excise tax on now-legal marijuana sales , which would go to fund school construction , and an additional 10 % sales tax to fund marijuana enforcement laws . washington state has a measure that would require special labeling for genetically-modified foodâ€”a proposal that met with ardent opposition and eventual defeat in california last year . sure enough , out-of-state opponents have poured money into this race as well , the seattle times reports ; of the whopping $ 22 million raised in opposition , $ 550 has come from washingtonians . new jersey will consider a constitutional amendment to raise the state 's minimum wage to $ 8.25 an hour . new yorkers are considering whether or not to allow the construction of seven casinos , with the proceeds going towards education and/or cutting property taxes . new jersey is also considering a gambling bill of sorts , the star-ledger reports , allowing veterans ' groups to raise money via bingo games , raffles , and similar games .
