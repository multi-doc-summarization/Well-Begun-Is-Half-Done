a pharmaceutical company that has in recent years made billions of dollars on hepatitis c treatments—the three the fda has approved range from $ 75,000 to $ 94,500—has been named a " price gouger " and " tax dodger " in a new report . gilead sciences , the sixth richest drugmaker in the world , " is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them , and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits , " says frank clemente , executive director of americans for tax fairness , which issued the report this month . gilead has avoided some $ 10 billion in taxes by moving assets to ireland , where there is a lower tax rate , and then not bringing some $ 28.5 billion in profits back into the us . per the washington post , the california-based company 's revenues in 2015 hit $ 32.6 billion , up three times from 2012 . as for the accusation of gouging : last year , a senate investigation found that the company " pursued [ a ] profit-driven strategy " with its hepatitis drugs , rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price ( it had considered $ 50,000 ) . as the post notes , gilead , which declined to comment on the report , is n't alone in looking overseas for tax relief . plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it . apple , for instance , has squirreled away nearly $ 200 billion abroad , bloomberg reported last year . according to citizens for tax justice , that 's enabled the company to avoid paying $ 59.2 billion in us taxes . pfizer has some $ 193 billion abroad , per the post . the new report singling out gilead , the post points out , highlights the " simmering battle " between president obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries .
