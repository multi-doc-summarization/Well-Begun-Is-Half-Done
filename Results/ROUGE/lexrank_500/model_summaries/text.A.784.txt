we 're going to say what should be unnecessary : you can not charge your iphone in the microwave . or , as victims of the latest scam from the darlings at 4chan have found , you can try , but the results wo n't be much better than sticking it in your pocket and sitting on it . the hoax is billed as " wave , " reports mashable , an apparent " ios8 exclusive " in which you purportedly charge your phone " wirelessly through microwave frequencies ... using any standard household microwave . " the slick-looking ad for wave , which has been making the rounds on twitter and reddit , helpfully recommends " 60 seconds at 700w or 70 seconds at 800w . " it 's completely unknown how many suckers fell for wave , but mashable notes that " photos of fried iphones and burned microwaves " are circulating . and apparently enough of them that the lapd got in on the action , reports the la times . " this # wave capability is a # hoax . do n't be fooled into microwaving your # iphone6 . # apple # smartphone , " they tweeted . meanwhile , angry apple users with crispy iphones are n't the only ones torqued at 4chan : celebrities are apparently firing back , too .
