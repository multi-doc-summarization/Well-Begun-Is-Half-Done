decaying road tunnels have left brussels in a perpetual state of traffic chaos , but repairs are apparently on hold due to what citylab deems possibly " the world 's worst excuse for poor infrastructure " : hungry rodents . because the transportation department was housed 25 years ago in a hotel ( apparently when the responsibility for the roads passed from federal hands into local ones ) and did n't have a lot of space , the original construction blueprints for some of the city 's major tunnels were instead filed away in the pillars under a highway bridge , reuters reports . apparently the four-legged creatures got to them before their two-legged counterparts . the telegraph reports the plans were stored in that less-than-ideal location for two decades , and were moved to a typical storage facility in 2010 . but by then " they were apparently eaten by mice , " the ex-chief of brussels ' infrastructure department informed city officials on wednesday . ( well , they do say city mice are smarter than country mice . )
