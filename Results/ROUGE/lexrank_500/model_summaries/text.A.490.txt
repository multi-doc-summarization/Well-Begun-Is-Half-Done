scientists studying a stone age site in britain came across something that by all rights should n't have been there : wheat . more specifically , the researchers found the dna of wheat dating back 8,000 years off the coast of the isle of wight , reports reuters . that 's about 2,000 years before ancient brits began growing it , but scientists do n't think this means that hunter-gatherers in the region were farming earlier than thought . in fact , the lack of wheat pollen at the site suggests it was n't cultivated there at all . instead , the scientists say it shows that these old inhabitants were in contact with farmers elsewhere in europe and participating in a heretofore unknown " international wheat trade , " reports the bbc . " this is a smoking gun of cultural interaction , " says a co-author of the study in science . " the conventional view of britain at the time was that it was cut off , " but the find very much suggests otherwise . " we can only speculate how they got wheatâ€”it could have been trade , a gift , or stolen . " the best guess is that the wheat came from farmers in what is now france , reports npr . it 's also possible that a land bridge existed at the time linking britain to europe , one now covered by the english channel . the research site itself , called bouldnor cliff , is now underwater , but researchers think it was used for boat-building back in its day .
