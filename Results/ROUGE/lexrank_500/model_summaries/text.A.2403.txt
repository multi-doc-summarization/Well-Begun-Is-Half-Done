in 2015 , australian 6-year-old aidan fenton attended a controversial week-long " self-healing " workshop meant to treat his diabetes . after attending a course and returning to a nearby hotel , the boy collapsed in his family 's room ; his parents ' screams got the attention of staff , who called police , but aidan died at the scene , the washington post reports . now , nearly two years later , his parents , ages 56 and 41 , have been arrested and charged with their son 's manslaughter . police say aidan was denied food and insulin , and they say his parents were complicit in that denial ; their " gross negligence " caused his death , police say , per the sydney morning herald . if convicted , they face 25 years in jail . the workshop was run by hongchi xiao , a chinese man who describes himself as a " healer " and practices what he calls " paidalajin " therapy . it involves fasting , stretching , and slapping the skin until it bruises in order to release " poisoned blood . " he has not been charged in aidan 's death , and in a facebook post shortly after the incident he denied responsibility . but he was arrested in november in the uk on suspicion of manslaughter after a 71-year-old woman with diabetes died during one of his retreats . he 's currently out on bail . xiao insists that a study shows his paidalajin therapy can " cure " diabetes , though he notes that during a " healing crisis " while undergoing the therapy , patients needed treatment including " rapid action insulin to prevent ketoacidosis , " a medical emergency that can lead to death .
