the new jobs report is a case of good news/bad news . the us lost 33,000 jobs in september after hurricanes harvey and irma hit texas , florida , and other southeastern states , which the ap reports is the first decline in almost seven years . however , the labor department says the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 % from 4.4 % , the lowest level since february 2001 . so what 's going on ? " friday 's report overall sent conflicting signals about the labor market , in part because it 's based on separate surveys—one of employers , the other of households—that don ’ t always align precisely in any given month [ but ] typically point in the same direction over the longer term , " explains the wall street journal . looking past the hurricanes ' impact , the job market and economy generally look healthy , per the ap . some economists expect job growth to rebound in the coming months as businesses in the area reopen and construction companies ramp up repair and renovation work . " people will write off the weak number because of the hurricanes , " one economist tells the new york times . " the underlying trend is still pretty strong . " one good sign was that average hourly earnings , an important barometer , rose nearly 0.5 % , though the journal notes that if the hurricanes temporarily wiped out a lot of minimum wage jobs in the services industry , that would drive the overall number up . next month will be a truer test .
