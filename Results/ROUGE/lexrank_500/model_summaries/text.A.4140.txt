angry polish leaders have demanded an apology from the us ambassador after some ill-judged remarks on the holocaust from fbi director james comey . " in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of germany , and poland , and hungary , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil , " comey wrote in a washington post column . " they convinced themselves it was the right thing to do , the thing they had to do . " many poles are infuriated by the suggestion they shared the blame for nazi crimes , reports the bbc , which notes that around 6 million polish citizens died during the 1939-45 occupation . " poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of world war ii , " says prime minister ewa kopacz . " i would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter . " the american ambassador in warsaw says suggestions that any country other than " nazi germany was responsible for the holocaust are wrong , harmful , and offensive , " adding that he thinks comey 's wider message was that there were people , even in the us , who " aided the nazi criminals , or there were people who did not respond sufficiently , " reports reuters . in another washington post column , anne applebaum writes that it 's wrong to call poles " accomplices " because after the 1939 invasion of poland , it was germans who created " a lawless , violent world , one in which anyone could be arbitrarily murdered , any jew could be deportedâ€”and any pole who helped a jew could be shot instantly , along with his entire family . many were .
