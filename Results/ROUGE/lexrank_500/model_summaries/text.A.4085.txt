facebook 's ipo is looking more disastrous by the day . regulators are now probing reports that underwriter morgan stanley and other banks cut their revenue forecasts for the company just days before the ipoâ€”but only advised major clients of the change . insiders believe the revised forecast , which smaller investors were not advised of , contributed to the weak performance of facebook shares , which finished more than 18 % below the ipo price yesterday , costing investors close to $ 40 billion , reuters reports . regulators in massachusetts have subpoenaed chief underwriter morgan stanley , and the sec is reviewing the allegations the forecasts were cut after a tipoff from a facebook exec , according to business insider , which notes that such " selective disclosure " is grossly unfair to investors at best and a violation of securities laws at worst . " there is no debating this is a misadventure of epic proportions , " a greencrest capital analyst tells cbs . " this was supposed to be the chance to restore the public 's faith in the public markets and in wall street , " he says . " and instead , it 's been a reminder of everything people suspected , feared , or hated about the public markets and wall street . "
