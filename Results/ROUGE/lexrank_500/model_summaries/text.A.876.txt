andrew young , who also once pretended to be the father of rielle hunter 's baby to cover for former boss john edwards , took the stand at edwards ' campaign finance trial yesterday—and he was a mess . he got flustered , gave conflicting ( and at least once , wrong ) answers , and constantly asked for questions to be repeated—and this was while being questioned by his own side , the prosecution . after a performance like that , the washington post 's melinda henneberger predicts that " he stands a very good chance of being ripped apart by the defense " during cross-examination today . highlights from his testimony , via the post , the ap , and the news-record : the night edwards announced his 2008 campaign , he , young , and hunter passed around a bottle of wine in the car as young drove to the kick-off event , young said . when edwards first learned of hunter 's pregnancy , " he said she was a crazy slut and there was a 1-in-3 chance that it was his , " young said . when heiress rachel " bunny " mellon started funneling money to hunter—the central issue of the trial— " we were scared , " young said . " it was a truckload of money , more money than had ever flowed through our accounts . ... it was crazy . " in order to phone hunter without his wife finding out , edwards often used staffers ' phones … as well as a secret cell phone he , young , and hunter referred to as " the bat phone , " young said . when edwards came up with the idea of using young as a cover , he gave young what the aide referred to as a " campaign stump speech " explaining that the issue " was bigger than all of us , " and that voters " don ’ t give a s -- - about you . they want me . " why did young agree to it ? " i wanted my friend to be president , " he admitted . " being friends with the most powerful person on earth , there are benefits to that . "
