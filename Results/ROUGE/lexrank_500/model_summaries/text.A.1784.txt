" some people love it and some are broken by it , but it â€™ s all in the name of fun , " he says . benington developed the drink after an emergency room nurse asked for something that would get her through a long shift . it comes with a warning for people with heart or blood pressure issues , and he has " quite a detailed talk " with anyone who orders it because " if i can talk them out of it , they 're not ready , " he tells cnn . one area dietitian is not amused . " caffeine is a drug , not a game or a toy , " she says . the author of a book espousing the benefits of caffeine also chimes in that this drink goes too far .

" it also notes that a fatal dose of caffeine is generally considered to be 18 grams over one or two hours . ( there is such a thing as fatal caffeine intoxication . )
