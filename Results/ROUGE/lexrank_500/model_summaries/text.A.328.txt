microsoft unveiled its much-hyped project natal motion control system—now renamed “ kinect ” —at e3 last night , in a performance long on grandiosity and short on actual revelations . after walking through a set of fake living rooms , the white-poncho-wearing audience was treated to a performance by cirque du soleil acrobats dressed as cavemen , as a narrator declared that “ history is about to rewritten ” and a boy , raising his arms , used his movements usher in the new motion-based way to play games , according to the wall street journal . and what was this grand historical event all about ? well , mostly mimicking the wii , according to cnet . microsoft ’ s camera-based motion controller may have potential , but the games demoed last night mostly looked like analogues for successful wii efforts , including a yoga game , a racing game , and a wii sports-esque game titled—wait for it—kinect sports . ign has a full list of launch titles . microsoft is expected to reveal more details , including pricing , at its press conference today .
