the first name on your family tree—in fact , on the family tree of every living creature—should technically be luca . as the new york times explains , the acronym stands for the last universal common ancestor , an organism that lived about 4 billion years ago and became the ancestor of all life forms . now , a new study in nature microbiology provides what its authors say is evidence that settles the debate about where this first life began : near hydrothermal vents , like those found near deep-sea volcanoes . researchers at germany 's heinrich heine university say their genetic sleuthing has revealed that luca was tailor-made to live in such an environment—it was essentially " a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen , " in the words of science . to figure out this genetic profile , the scientists examined 6 million genes associated with two simple and ancient forms of life , bacteria and archaea . after identifying genes that were shared between the two groups , they whittled the figure down to 355 gene families that met their criteria for having originated in luca , their joint ancestor . “ it was flabbergasting to us that we found as many as we did , ” says lead researcher william martin . this smaller group of genes allowed them to create a snapshot of sorts of luca , one hailed as " remarkable " by a ucla evolutionary biologist . but do n't expect the debate to end . the study “ is all very interesting , but it has nothing to do with the actual origin of life , ” cambridge chemist john sutherland tells the times . ( in less ancient but still ancient news , the remains of more real-life hobbits have been found . )
