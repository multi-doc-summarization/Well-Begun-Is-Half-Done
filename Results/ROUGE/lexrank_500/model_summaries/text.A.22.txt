eight endangered rhinos have died after a move to a new park in kenya . per the ap , the black rhinos died in what kenyan conservationist paula kahumbu calls " a complete disaster " after they were relocated from two locations to tsavo east national park last month . officials suspect salt poisoning as the cause , pointing to higher salinity in water sources in their new home . when the saltier water made the rhinos thirsty , they likely drank even more , possibly leading to their deaths , the country 's ministry of tourism and wildlife said in a statement . the rhinos were among 11 moved to the park , and officials said the surviving animals are being closely monitored . the planned relocation of other rhinos to the park has been suspended . as the guardian notes , the save the rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500 . the species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in asia . moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas . while deaths can and do occur with such moves , officials say a death rate of this magnitude is uncommon . kenyan wildlife officials said the results of an investigation into the deaths would be made public as soon as it concludes .
