if you live and die by food and beverage expiration dates , you might not want to know how old some of our drinking water is . a study finds that 30 % to 50 % of the water found in our taps and oceans contains molecules created more than 4.5 billion years ago—making them older than our solar system and the sun , the los angeles times reports . the findings from the study , published in science , indicate that certain water molecules contain a deuterium atom instead of a hydrogen atom ( making what 's called " heavy water " ) , which could only be created under very cold , energy-replete conditions—specific conditions that did n't exist before the earth , sun , and solar system were formed . earth was actually " born dry , " in an extremely hot environment , according to the times . scientists believe we eventually received water via comets or asteroids that crashed down on earth 's surface . figuring out where the water in the comets and asteroids came from , however , is another story , though researchers think they 've narrowed it down to two possibilities : that the heavy deuterium water was dispersed among bodies in the solar system during the " violent " process of our sun 's birth , or that the heavy water originated from ice found in the gas cloud from which our sun and solar system were born . either way , researchers say this could indicate that young planets all around the universe contain water : according to scientists , there are up to 11 billion planets outside our own system that could house liquid water and , possibly , life , notes time . ( the amount of water found on mars surprised scientists around the world . )
