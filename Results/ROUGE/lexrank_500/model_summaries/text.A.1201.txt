an arizona mom wants answers as to why her 5-year-old kindergartner now has a " sexual misconduct " stamp on his permanent school file . erica martinez says her son , eric lopez , pulled down his pants and exposed himself when another student at ashton ranch elementary school " intimidated " him on the playground . the superintendent of the dysart unified school district says administrators labelled the event as " sexual misconduct " per school policy , but martinez argues her son does n't even know what that means and his actions were far from sexual , the arizona republic reports . eric was asked to sign a " sexual misconduct " referral without martinez present , cbs news previously reported—though school officials say the signature only indicates he received due process . eric spent a lunch period in detention , but the referral will stay in his school record while he remains in the district . " this is a child 's school record , and it 's not something to be taken lightly , " an expert notes . labels like " sexual misconduct , " another adds , could hurt a child this age if they 're internalized . kids need to be " put back on the right path ... rather than adults using adult words with kids that do n't even really apply , " that expert says , but the school says it 's just following state guidelines for defining certain types of misbehavior . the status of lopez 's case is unclear—cbs reported last month that his mother 's appeal to have the mark removed from his file was denied , but the republic says she has not yet formally appealed .
