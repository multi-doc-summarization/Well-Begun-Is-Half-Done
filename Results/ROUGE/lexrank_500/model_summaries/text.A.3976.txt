joseph kony has named his 22-year-old son as deputy leader of his lord 's resistance armyâ€”and top ugandan general sam kavuma says the move is a sign that kony 's control over the guerrilla force is weakening . fighters have separated into different autonomous groups roaming across remote parts of africa , and " the role of the son is an indication kony has lost contact with most of his commanders , some who have been killed by our forces and others are in disarray , with the rebels becoming weaker , " kavuma says , according to afp . salim saleh is said to have spent his life fighting with his father 's violent rebel forces . " previously the son was in charge of the group providing security to the father , but now he has an added responsibility of field command , " kavuma says . the lra continues to evade ugandan troops and us special forces attempting to hunt it down . in november , there were reports kony was ill and his reign might be nearing an end . in a report last week , the un said kony is hiding in a sudanese-controlled area of the disputed border between south sudan and the central african republic , al-jazeera reports , and voice of america adds that a un official predicted kony 's capture is " coming pretty soon .
