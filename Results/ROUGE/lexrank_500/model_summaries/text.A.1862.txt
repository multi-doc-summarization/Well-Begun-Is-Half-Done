" breaking us up like this seems to go against everything the boy scouts is about , " she tells nbc . " it seems to me that when you are in a dispute with a partner you try to work it out with the partner . it ’ s very clear we ’ re not viewed as an equal partner . " she says the church plans to stand by mcgrath , who is married to his partner of 20 years , and the youth program will continue under a different name . " we ’ re going to stand firm , " she says . " geoffrey attends our church , and this is a way to support our youth in the neighborhood . "
