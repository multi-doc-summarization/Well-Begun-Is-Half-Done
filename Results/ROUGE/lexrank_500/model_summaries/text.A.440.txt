" ... in this case , around 1,500 years ago , i would call this the historical mayan version of game of thrones , " excavation co-director tomas barrientos tells phys.org . archaeologists already knew that kaanul kings dominated the maya lowlands for decades , but the altar—which likely dates to 544 a.d.—shows that la corona " was the place where the most important historical mayan political movement began to take shape , " says barrientos . team leader marcello canuto sees the dynasty rising up with a mix of cultural appropriation , like conjuring old gods on the tablet to gain legitimacy ; marriage , with a princess from neighboring mexico ; and other alliances with powerful forces . otherwise , beating tikal " would be the equivalent to cuba defeating the united states in a war , " says canuto . " they could only have done that ... if they had had the backing of the soviet union . " announced wednesday , the altar is on display at the national museum of archaeology and ethnology in guatemala city , per the times-picayune .
