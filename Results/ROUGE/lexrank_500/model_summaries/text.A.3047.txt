a german dendrochronologist stumbled on something puzzling while gathering wood cores on the norwegian coast in 2016 : some trees were missing rings . " we got back to the lab and measured the tree rings , and saw that they were very narrow—in some cases nearly absent—for 1945 , " claudia hartl tells the afp . a local scientist had a theory , she explained wednesday at the annual meeting of the european geosciences union : that it had something to do with the tirpitz . the 820-foot battleship was the largest in hitler 's navy , and the bbc reports it spent much of wwii anchored and hiding along norway 's coast , including in kåfjord , where hartl observed the tree-ring anomaly . but then allied forces found it , and that 's when the trees suffered , believes hartl . the nazi ship released chlorosulphuric acid as a sort of " chemical fog " to try to cloak it from aerial enemy forces , and hartl now believes the acid caused damage to the trees ' needles . " if trees do n't have needles they ca n't photosynthesize and they ca n't produce biomass , " she explains , noting recovery can be a multi-year process as pine trees can retain their needles for as long as seven years . and that jibes with what she found : in one case , a tree had no growth for nine years and took three decades to revert to " normal growth . " near where the ship was stationed all the trees she studied were affected , with more than 60 % not growing at all in 1945 . she found the impact on the rings diminished with distance , with trees about 2.5 miles away starting to be unaffected . as for the tirpitz 's ploy , it did n't work : it was ultimately sunk . ( using ink and urine , this man recorded nazi horrors . )
