chicago will hold its very first mayoral runoff election , because incumbent rahm emanuel failed to win the 50 % of the vote that he needed in yesterday 's election to secure a second term . he got just 45.4 % , and cook county commissioner jesus " chuy " garcia got 33.9 % ; they 'll face off on april 7 . how it 's being framed : the chicago tribune notes that emanuel suffered " a national political embarrassment , " calling garcia " little-known " and " lesser-funded . " it notes emanuel 's problems with voters : his closure of 50 schools and " standoff " with teachers during a strike in 2012 ( their first in a quarter-century , usa today notes ) , plus his " struggles " to decrease violent crime . reuters calls it a " surprise result , " noting that emanuel " hugely outspent " his four opponents and had support from vips involved in everything from hollywood to hedge funds—the president even backed him , and visited the city last week . in fact , the result is " disappointing " for obama , who recorded radio ads for his former chief of staff and even appeared in one of emanuel 's tv ads , politico says , but notes that " there is nothing to suggest that obama is at fault for emanuel ’ s showing . " politico also says emanuel will " start as the heavy favorite " in the runoff campaign .
