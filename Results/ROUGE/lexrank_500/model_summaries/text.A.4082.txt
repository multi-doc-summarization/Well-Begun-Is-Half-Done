a nuclear accident happened somewhere in russia or kazakhstan during the last week of september and was kept very quiet , the french nuclear safety institute irsn has concluded after analyzing a mysterious radioactive cloud that appeared over europe last month . irsn researchers say they detected high levels of ruthenium 106 , a type of atom that does not occur in nature and is only found when atoms are split in reactors , reuters reports . the cloud was at its peak during the first week in october and dissipated until it could not be detected in france by oct. 13 , according to irsn , which says its analysis of weather patterns points to a source between the ural mountains and the volga river . the institute , which says other european nuclear regulators have made similar findings , has ruled out the crash of a radioactive satellite or an accident at a nuclear reactor as the source of the cloud . it says the most likely source was either a facility dealing with spent nuclear fuel or a facility for radioactive medicine . russian authorities say they 're not aware of any accident in the area , while kazakh authorities have n't been reached for comment yet , irsn says . the institute says the cloud itself is harmless and is unlikely to contaminate food , though it says there must have been a very large amount of ruthenium 106 released at the accident site , enough that would have theoretically warranted an evacuation of a radius of several miles .
