four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system . and it turns out that one of them really did n't want his daughter to marry her boyfriend . the patients all had advanced als and were unable to control even their eyes , reports the guardian . in other words , they had " locked-in syndrome , " meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing . researchers at the university of tübingen in germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain , they explain in the journal plos biology . they first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse 's name , and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered . “ it ’ s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever , because with all of these patients , we can now ask them the most critical questions in life , ” says researcher niels birbaumer . the patients , all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home , range in age from 24 to 76 . the team did stumble on a couple surprises . for instance , all four patients suggested they were " happy " with their lives in spite of being locked-in . ( birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation . ) and one patient , who is 61 , answered " no " nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend mario . " but they got married , " one of the researchers tells the bbc . " nothing can come between love . " ( researchers ca n't explain how stephen hawking has lived this long . )
