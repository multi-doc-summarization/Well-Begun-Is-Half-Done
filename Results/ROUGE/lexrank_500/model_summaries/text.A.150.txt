a barista in washington , dc , has unintentionally raised a philosophical quandary by rejecting the idea that the customer is always right . when a guy asked for espresso on ice , the barista flat out refused , the huffington post reports via a prince of petworth transcript . " we don â€™ t do that because it will ruin it . we make the best espresso in the city and putting it over ice will shock it , " the barista at chinatown coffee co. reportedly said . when the customer seemed befuddled , the barista replied , " aw , did i just ruin your day ? " huffpo notes that a few years back , a disgruntled customer blogged about another coffee shop 's rejection of his request for the same drink . as the post gathered traction , the shop released a statement of its rules , including : " no espresso in a to-go cup . no espresso over ice . these are our policies . we have our reasons , and we 're happy to share them .
