killing off millions of users is as bad as a mistake as a website can make—but luckily for facebook , it was reversible . the company apologized for a " terrible error " friday that caused the profiles of many users—including mark zuckerberg—to be switched to the " memorialized " version used after people die , the bbc reports . " we hope people who love mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life , " said the message under the " remembering mark zuckerberg " banner . pages are usually only memorialized after a user dies and friends or family request the change and provide proof of death . affected users scrambled to reassure friends and family that they were still alive , cbs reports . " having a tough day today , but not dead , just in case facebook tries to claim that i am , " one user posted . facebook said it had introduced a new message for memorialized pages and accidentally displayed it on the accounts of around 2 million living users . " we are very sorry that this happened and we worked as quickly as possible to fix it , " a spokesman said . the guardian notes that the blunder happened just two days after zuckerberg insisted that fake news on facebook played no role in people 's voting decisions .
