a rarity in the demilitarized zone between north and south korea today : a soldier from the north defected and claims to have killed two commanding officers in order to do so , reports the voice of america . soldiers in the south heard about six shots , then allowed the soldier to cross the dmz . he is still being interrogated . “ we 'll see as he 's debriefed and it 's just a one-off incident , so i do n't think there 's too much we can read into it besides that at this point , ” says an analyst with the international crisis group . pyongyang , not surprisingly , has not confirmed the incident , reports the bbc . the north generally puts only its best soldiers at the border after a careful vetting process , and defections are rare . one reason : the family of a defecting soldier is sure to face harsh punishment , notes voa .
