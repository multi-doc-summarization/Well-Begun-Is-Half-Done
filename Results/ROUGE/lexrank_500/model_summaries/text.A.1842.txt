" the uk has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech , " the petition reads . " the same principles should apply to everyone who wishes to enter the uk . if the united kingdom is to continue applying the 'unacceptable behaviour ' criteria to those who wish to enter its borders , it must be fairly applied to the rich as well as poor , and the [ powerful ] as well as [ weak ] . " this scottish david has taken on the american goliath before . kelly , a citizen journalist for the aberdeen voice , gave trump a hard time when he was building his aberdeen golf course a few years back ; she 's also tried to get the real estate mogul stripped of an honorary degree at a local university , cnn notes . " the petition will allow all uk residents who want to stand up against … donald trump 's hate speech specifically the opportunity to do so , " kelly tells the voice . " people have been barred from the united kingdom for less . " the metro backs up that claim , citing the banning of both rapper tyler the creator and anti-islam activist pamela geller . meanwhile , a counter-petition entitled " do n't ban trump from the united kingdom " has emerged , calling kelly 's arguments " illogical " —but that petition had just over 1,600 signatures as of this writing . the house of commons tells cnn a committee will decide jan. 5 how to handle kelly 's petition .
