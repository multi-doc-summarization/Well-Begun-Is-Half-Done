think we 've stored so much data that future historians will be swimming in the stuff ? not necessarily : a google executive says the " digital dark ages " may be coming , when people will have little idea of how we think or live today , npr reports . google vice president vint cerf expressed his concern last week at a conference of scientists in california : " if we 're thinking 1,000 years , 3,000 years ahead in the future , we have to ask ourselves , how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create ? " he says . " we are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it . " cerf 's worry is that future " modern computers " will have no way of reading content from today 's software . comparing future historians to doris kearns goodwin—who relied quite a bit on letters of the period when writing team of rivals about abraham lincoln 's cabinet—cerf warns that today 's email stash could vanish " because nobody saved it " or because it ca n't be read since it was created on century-old software , per the independent . and he discards the notion that " important " stuff will be stored , saying that " sometimes documents and transactions images and so on may turn out to have an importance which is not understood for hundreds of years . " his advice for us : print those photos . for big data savers : embrace the idea of " digital vellum , " which involves snapping a pic of every way a file can be opened , and storing it with the original file , reports engineering and technology magazine . " we 're going to have to build into our thinking the concept of preservation writ large , " says cerf . ( unless of course the world ends up taken over by robots . )
