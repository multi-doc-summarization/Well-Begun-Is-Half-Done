we now have the most definitive sign yet—courtesy of a nasa orbiter—that the european space agency 's mars lander crashed onto the planet 's surface in what the ap describes as a " fiery ball of rocket fuel . " esa lost contact with the schiaparelli lander wednesday , approximately 50 seconds before it was supposed to land on mars . what exactly happened to the lander has been a mystery , but a crash seemed likely . now , images from a nasa orbiter released friday show an approximately 6,500-square-foot dark patch on the martian surface a few miles from where the lander was supposed to touch down , the bbc reports . that spot is likely the result of an exploding lander . esa reports the lander 's parachute deployed then released as planned ( it 's probably the small light spot in the new image ) . but the lander 's nine thrusters fired for only a few seconds instead of half a minute for some reason . the lander probably free-fell for up to 2.5 miles before hitting mars at more than 185mph . and since the thrusters did n't use much of the stored rocket fuel , a decent-sized explosion was probably the result . nasa plans to get a better picture of the crash site next week . the lander was meant to be testing technology for another esa landing in 2020 . its failure means nasa is still the only agency to successfully land a robotic vehicle on mars , having done so several times .
