the huffington post thinks it looks like " a cross between a pac-man ghost and a pokemon creature . " but it will be a researcher at the monterey bay aquarium research institution who will get the honor of bestowing a name on the little octopus with huge eyes . ( or " puppy dog eyes " as the san francisco chronicle puts it . ) and do n't underestimate the cuteness factor : “ as someone that ’ s describing the species , you get to pick what the specific name is , ” stephanie bush tells science friday . “ one of the thoughts i had was making it opisthoteuthis adorabilis because they ’ re really cute. ” ( a newly discovered frog looks very , very familiar . )
