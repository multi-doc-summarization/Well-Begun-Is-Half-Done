“ snowden did not try to mask his identity , or lie to the fbi . he knew he would pay a personal price . as he has , ” 15 former staff members of the church committee write in an 8-page letter to president obama . the church committee investigated illegal activity by intelligence agencies in the 1970s , and now its experts are asking for leniency for edward snowden , the guardian reports . according to the intercept , the group argues that snowden , acting selflessly , " stimulated reform " through his actions . the letter writers say that without snowden , americans may still not know “ what intelligence agencies acting in our name had been up to , " techcrunch reports . the letter gives more weight to the movement to get snowden pardoned , though the members of the church committee do n't go that far ; they want snowden to strike a deal with the government . “ there is no question that snowden broke the law , " they write . " but previous cases in which others violated the same law suggest leniency . " they point to former cia director david petraeus , currently being considered by donald trump for secretary of state . he leaked confidential information in violation of national security but received no jail time after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor . in contrast , snowden is facing a sentence of 30 years if he returns to the us from russia , where he has been living in exile .
