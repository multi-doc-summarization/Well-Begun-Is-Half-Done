critics are not sold on wonderful world , a creaky indie starring matthew broderick as a misanthropic children ’ s folksinger . here ’ s what the critics are saying : world is “ a checklist-indie that offers up clichés with gusto , ” even flirting with magical negro stereotypes , writes nick schager of slant . “ broderick mopes and grouses admirably , ” but this treacle is still “ pretty close to the bottom of the barrel. ” keith uhlich of time out new york agrees , crediting the cast with giving a “ committed , nearly convincing effort ” in what ’ s ultimately “ fey indiewood bullcrap. ” the script , a “ shopworn tale of redemption , ” is atrocious , writes melissa anderson of the village voice , and it ’ s heartbreaking to see talented female lead sanaa lathan in “ such a ridiculous , implausible role . " broderick , meanwhile , “ looks as if he wants to hide behind his three-day growth. ” indeed , mark olsen of the los angeles times wonders what the heck happened to broderick . “ one looks at the guy and he seems miserable , ” he writes . “ is adulthood that dreary ? is there something else we should know ? ”
