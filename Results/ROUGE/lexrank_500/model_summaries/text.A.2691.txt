a security researcher has earned the equivalent of a first-class , round-the-world trip after he submitted what he thought were a couple of " lame " bugs to united 's new bug bounty program . in an industry first , united announced a bounty in may that rewards miles to anyone who identifies a bug on its website . there are 10 bug classes eligible : cross-site scripting bugs , for example , are worth 50,000 miles , while authentication bypass bugs earn 250,000 . while " passively poking the site , " jordan wiens , founder of a florida security company , says he found what he thought were two remote code execution bugs , which allow a hacker to run their own potentially dangerous code on a site . " i also thought they were lame and was n't sure if they were on parts of the infrastructure that qualified , " he tells threatpost . " i figured they 'd award me 50,000 miles or something smaller . " it turns out rce bugs earn the highest payout : a maximum 1 million miles . after making his submission to united—his first to a bounty program , he says—wiens got an email asking for confirmation that he was a us citizen and that his six hours of research was completed in the us . " two hours later , i got a message to check my account that i had gotten my million miles , " he says . wiens , who ca n't share details of the bug , says the miles are worth $ 25,000 and could take him on a first-class trip around the world or on 40 domestic round-trip flights in coach . his plan is to use the miles on coach trips for his family , plus one luxurious flight with his wife , he tells fox 13 . wired reports wiens ' award is the program 's first major payout . other security researchers have since shared their awards on twitter . one says he nabbed 500,000 miles . ( speaking of planes , a " horrible " and " evil " new seat design has been revealed . )
