an antarctic adventure cruise has become stuck in ice after a storm , and rescue ships are at least two days away—but to judge from the dispatches from the ship , the people aboard do n't seem to mind . the akademik shokalskiy sent out a distress call yesterday , news.com.au reports , but a spokesman for the spirit of mawson , which organized the voyage , says the russian ship is " reinforced against ice and well adapted to the conditions . " the ship is believed to have enough provisions aboard to hold out . reports differ on how many people are aboard—news.com.au says there are 50 tourists and 20 crew , while abc has the numbers at 35 and 22—but those " tourists " include scientists , explorers , and historians . " we 're in the ice like the explorers of old ! all are well and spirits are high . happy christmas , " the expedition leader tweeted . in a blog post , the ship said it was just two nautical miles from open sea , but powerless to get closer . the timing of the storm was actually fairly fortuitous though ; if it had struck earlier , it might have caught the adventurers in the middle of a nearly 40-mile hike across pack ice .
