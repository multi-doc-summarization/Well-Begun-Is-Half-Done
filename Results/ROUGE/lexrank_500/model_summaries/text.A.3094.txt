to say north koreans turned out in droves to vote in state elections yesterday would be an understatement , because state media are reporting 99.7 % voter turnout , sky news reports . that 's only the first eyebrow-raiser about the country 's electoral process , held every four years so voters can " choose " mayors , governors , and local assemblies . north koreans over age 17 are not only required to show , they 're also told which preapproved candidates to vote for by placing already prepared ballots in the ballot boxes , cnn notes . and according to sky , it was a " festive atmosphere , " with voters " singing and dancing " as they cast votes . " all participants took part in the elections with extraordinary enthusiasm to cement the revolutionary power , " the korean central news agency proclaimed . voting is simple : to vote " yes " for the candidate predetermined by kim jong un 's workers ' party , participants just place their ballot in the correct box ; those who vote " no " place their ballot in a separate box , all within view of elections officials , the economist explained in 2014 . abstaining or voting no is viewed as treason , the bbc notes . the real reason for even having the vote is basically to serve as a census of sorts and to keep track of no-show defectors , nk news notes . a professor of asian studies explains that this election system makes even more extreme the one used in the soviet union during the cold war , including the ridiculously high turnout rates . " people used to joke that on the day of elections that no one would dare to die in north korea , let alone lose consciousness , " he says . as for that 0.3 % who did n't vote this time ? kcna says those individuals either live abroad or work " on the high seas , " per chosun ilbo .
