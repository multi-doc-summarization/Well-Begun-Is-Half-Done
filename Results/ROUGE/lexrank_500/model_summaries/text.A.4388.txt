it 's no surprise that mexico is keeping a very close eye on drug lord joaquin guzman after recapturing him for the second time—but that does n't mean his wife has to like it . in her first public comments about " el chapo , " beauty queen emma coronel says she fears he may not survive the " slow torture " of solitary confinement at el altiplano , the prison he left through a mile-long tunnel last year . " they want to make him pay for his escape . they say that they are not punishing him . of course they are . they are there with him , watching him in his cell , " coronel says , per the los angeles times . " they do n't let him sleep . he has no privacy , not even to go to the restroom . " the telemundo interview with coronel was recorded in mexico in mid-february and aired sunday night , nbc news reports . coronel—who married guzman on her 18th birthday eight years ago , when he was 50—has dual american-mexican citizenship and gave birth to his twin girls in california in 2011 . he is believed to have at least 17 other children . coronel says she only saw her husband twice during his months as a fugitive last year . " he just wanted to have a nice time with his daughters , " she says . " to be in peace . " she claims to know little of guzman 's drug empire and says she has never seen him use drugs or violence . " he is like any other man—of course he is not violent , not rude , " she says . " i have never heard him say a bad word . i have never seen him get excited or be upset at anyone . " ( when authorities closed in , guzman temporarily escaped through a door hidden behind a mirror . )
