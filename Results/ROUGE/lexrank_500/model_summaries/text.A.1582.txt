in a lawsuit filed wednesday , former trump campaign manager paul manafort is challenging special counsel robert mueller 's authority to investigate crimes and seeking to have the indictment against himself thrown out , the wall street journal reports . according to the washington post , the lawsuit calls the actions of mueller , deputy attorney general rod rosenstein , and the department of justice " arbitrary , capricious , and not in accordance with the law . " at issue is what the lawsuit claims was overly broad authority granted to mueller by rosenstein , cnn reports . mueller was given orders to investigate possible collusion between the trump campaign and russian government , as well as " any matters that arose or may arise directly from that . " manafort has been charged with money laundering , fraud , and more as part of mueller 's investigation . but the lawsuit claims those charges have nothing to do with the trump campaign , instead arising from lobbying work manafort did on behalf of ukrainian groups . the lawsuit states that work ended in 2014 . the lawsuit—which seeks to have mueller removed as special counsel and prohibited from similar investigations against manafort—states the indictment against manafort " is completely unmoored from the special counsel 's original jurisdiction . " a spokesperson for the department of justice says manafort 's lawsuit " is frivolous , but the defendant is entitled to file whatever he wants . "
