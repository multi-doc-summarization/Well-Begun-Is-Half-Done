the us president may not directly control gas prices , but barack obama 's " disdain " for oil is still hurting americans terribly , writes charles krauthammer in the washington post . restricting drilling , vetoing the keystone pipeline , and similar anti-oil moves are killing thousands of local jobs , hurting relations with canada , and sending billions of dollars to venezuela , russia , and saudi arabia . trying to develop alternative fuels of the future is a waste of time and resources . " drilling is the single most important thing we can do to spur growth at home while strengthening our hand abroad , " writes krauthammer . high gas prices are " a constant reminder of three years of a rigid , fatuous , fantasy-driven energy policy that has rendered us scandalously dependent and excessively vulnerable . " but calls for more drilling are just " intellectual bankruptcy , " argues paul krugman in the new york times . america is already in a " hydrocarbon boom , " with oil and natural gas production on the rise , but that has not stopped oil prices from soaring . that 's because increasing demand from developing countries and mideast war worries " easily outweigh any downward pressure on prices from rising us production . " the hydrocarbon boom has also had little effect on jobs—the 70,000 jobs gained since the middle of the last decade represent just .05 % of total us employment . so why the gop focus on fossil fuels ? one , the oil and gas lobby . and , two , conservatives have no other ideas . " and intellectual bankruptcy , i ’ m sorry to say , is a problem that no amount of drilling and fracking can solve . "
