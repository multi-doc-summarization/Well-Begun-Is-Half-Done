wildlife officials in thailand have begun removing some of the 137 tigers held at a buddhist temple following accusations that the monks were involved in illegal breeding and trafficking of the animals . the director of thailand 's wildlife conservation office , teunjai noochdumrong , says three tigers were tranquilized and transported monday in an operation involving about 1,000 state personnel that 's expected to continue for a week . the animals will be taken to three government animal refuges elsewhere in thailand . the temple , a popular money-earning tourist attraction in the western province of kanchanaburi , has been criticized by animal rights activists because of allegations it 's not properly set up to care for the animals and flouted regulations , the ap reports the monks resisted previous efforts to take away the tigers , and they impeded the effort again on monday morning despite the massive show of force by the authorities . it was " mayhem , " noochdumrong tells cnn . " when our vet team arrived , there were tigers roaming around everywhere , " he says . " looks like the temple intentionally let these tigers out , trying to obstruct our work . " the monks relented after police obtained a court order . more than 300 officials remained at the temple overnight to ensure the tigers remained safe . ( this tiger was found roaming a residential neighborhood in texas . )
