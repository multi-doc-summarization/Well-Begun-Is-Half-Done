ashley judd made a tv appearance last month looking larger than normal and with a puffier face , and the ensuing criticism of her appearance led her to write a scathing but eloquent response in the daily beast . judd was on steroids due to an illness ( leading some to assume her puffy face was the result of having had work done ) and had gained a little weight over the winter ( leading some to joke that her husband must be looking for a new woman ) . " the conversation was pointedly nasty , gendered , and misogynistic and embodies what all girls and women in our culture , to a greater or lesser degree , endure every day , in ways both outrageous and subtle , " judd writes . particularly worrisome is the fact that women themselves jumped right into the objectification . " patriarchy , " she writes , " is not men . patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate . " her piece ( worth a read in full here ) garnered quite a reaction . samples from both sides : " like it or not , hollywood actresses are ... thinner than normal , less wrinkly than normal , and they are paid more than normal to look that way , " writes lindsay ferrier on the stir . " any woman who chooses to be a movie star also chooses to take the media knocks that come with the job . " full piece here . judd is " a smart , bold , kickass feminist , " declares lindy west on jezebel , noting that the older she gets , the more she rejects " the notion that when you profit from being a public figure you become public property . " as for west , she 's done with covering " the flavor-of-the-week 's gaping coke nostril . ... my feminism does n't end where your celebrity begins . " full piece here .
