" why are our lives so different , just because of where we are born ? " that 's the question posed to the washington post by suh , a 30-year-old north korean woman now being held in a bangkok detention center after being busted by local cops while trying to cross from laos to thailand . and this is only her most recent travail : suh and two other women interviewed by the post were trying to flee their lives as sex " video chatters " in china , an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping north korea—either by willingly getting sold to chinese men to get out of their home country , or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in china , only to end up as human trafficking victims . purchasing north korean women is big business in china for men who ca n't find wives any other way : the asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $ 12,000 . life in china is impoverished and dangerous for these north korean nationals : they can be deported back to their home country if they 're caught , per radio free asia . north korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online " video chatting " business , allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes . but it 's a demeaning , demoralizing trade . " i felt so disgusting , " suh says . and it 's what led suh ( who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her , but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind ) and the two other women to try to escape once more—this time to laos , then to thailand , where they would n't have been able to be repatriated back to north korea . the two women being detained with suh want to eventually make it to south korea , but suh is applying for asylum instead in " the strongest country on earth " : the united states . ( their sad story here . )
