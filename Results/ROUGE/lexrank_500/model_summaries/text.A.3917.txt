hillary clinton says she lost the 2016 election due in part to the hacking of the democratic national committee . emmanuel macron , on the other hand , looks poised to become france 's next president despite a seemingly similar effort to derail his campaign . according to cybersecurity firm trend micro , macron—who will compete against far-right candidate marine le pen in the may 7 election—appears to have been targeted by the same russian hackers who took aim at clinton 's campaign , though officials say they didn ’ t manage to steal staffers ’ email passwords , per the new york times . the scheme involved emails sent to campaign officials with links to web addresses almost identical to those of macron 's party , cnn reports . trend micro—which also claims the hackers targeted groups linked to political parties in germany , per the hill—says it traced those addresses to fancy bear , the same group us intelligence has blamed for the dnc hack . the macron campaign had previously suggested russia might be behind a " highly sophisticated " effort to access campaign emails using shady web pages that were " pixel perfect " matches to originals , with only tiny differences in urls . in response to the report , however , a spokesman for vladimir putin says russia has " never interfered " in foreign elections and the latest charges are " a reminder of the accusations that were heard from washington just recently and that have remained unconfirmed to this day .
