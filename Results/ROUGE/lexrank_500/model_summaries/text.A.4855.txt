the exact nature of the relationship between schizophrenia and cannabis still is n't clear to scientists , but a new study offers additional clues . researchers studied genetic data on 2,082 people , about half of whom had used cannabis , reuters reports ; they focused on the number of schizophrenia-linked genes in the subjects . the experts found that those with a predisposition to the illness were more likely to use cannabis—and to use more of it—than were those without schizophrenia-linked genes , regardless of mental health history . in other words , says a researcher , the study suggests " a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use . " the verge explains the complexities of the possible relationship between schizophrenia and marijuana : in the 1960s , for instance , scientists thought that smoking marijuana could cause psychosis in most people ; these days , researchers believe using the drug may spur schizophrenia in those who are predisposed to it . the new study effectively turns the idea around , suggesting that those who are predisposed to the illness may also be predisposed to using marijuana . but that does n't mean weed use does n't increase schizophrenia risk , an outside expert notes : " both ( theories ) may be true . "
