which are you more afraid of : giant rats or dying of tuberculosis ? hopefully you chose dying of tuberculosis , because reuters reports a belgian organization called apopo is training dozens of african giant pouched rats to sniff out tb , starting with at-risk populations in the crowded prisons of tanzania and mozambique . " this program is very important as the rats will enable â€¦ early detection of tb in risk populations such as prisoners and prison staff , " an apopo doctor tells the independent . according to npr , the 3-feet-long rats are quicker , better , and cheaper than lab technicians when it comes to screening for tb . it takes one lab technician four days to screen 100 samples ; a rat can screen that many in 20 minutes . and all it wants in compensation is a bit of banana . baby rats start their training as soon as their eyes open . they 're socialized to humans ( trainer " uncle albert " takes them on motorbike rides in between copious petting ) and taught to sniff out the presence of tb in mucus samples . once fully trained at nine months , they have a nearly 100 % accuracy rate in detecting tb . then it 's off to work . one rat named chewa does two 40-minute screening sessions per day with a break for napping and playing in between . and the usually enthusiastic rats are allowed to retire when they no longer appear to enjoy smelling mucus samples . " they can live out their days lounging with their friends , snacking on watermelon , running on wheels , chasing their tails , whatever they want to do , " an apopo community manager tells npr . " the life of a retired rat is especially blissful . "
