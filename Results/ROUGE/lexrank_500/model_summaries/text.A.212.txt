benjamin netanyahu today vowed to destroy hamas ' tunnels at all costs , even as israel called up an additional 16,000 reservistsâ€”bringing the total so far to 86,000 troops . " we are determined to complete this mission with or without a ceasefire , " he said of the tunnels ' destruction , as per haaretz . " therefore i will not agree to any offer that does not allow the military to complete this important mission for the security of the people of israel . " he also issued a get-in-line message to two ministers who have been critical of his actions against hamas , saying " beware of what you 're doing . " netanyahu 's statement vis a vis the tunnels comes as ceasefire efforts are sputtering anyway , notes the ap , and on the heels of the worst day of casualties thus far in gaza .
