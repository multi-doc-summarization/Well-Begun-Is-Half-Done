missouri gov . eric greitens acknowledges he was " unfaithful " in his marriage but denies allegations that he blackmailed the woman he had an affair with to stay quiet , the ap reports . the republican governor and his wife , sheena , released a joint statement wednesday night after kmov reported that greitens had a sexual relationship with his former hairdresser in 2015 . the station reported that the woman 's ex-husband alleged greitens photographed her nude and threatened to publicize the images if she spoke about the affair . " a few years ago , before eric was elected governor , there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage , " the greitens ' statement said . " it was a deeply personal mistake . " the woman allegedly involved did not comment on the record to kmov , which released its report late wednesday after greitens gave his state of the state speech . but her ex-husband , who divorced her in 2016 , provided a recording of her detailing a sexual encounter with greitens and saying greitens told her the photos would be released if she exposed the affair . she did not know she was being recorded . greitens ' statement with his wife did n't address the affair specifically or the allegations , but in a separate statement , greitens ' attorney , jim bennett , said , " there was no blackmail and that claim is false . " st. louis public radio notes that the news could damage greitens ' higher political aspirations , especially since his 2016 campaign focused on character and family values .
