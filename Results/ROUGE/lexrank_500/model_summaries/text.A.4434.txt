john boehner planned a strategy session later today with house republican leaders to plot their next move , but the prospects of avoiding a government shutdown before monday 's midnight deadline are getting bleaker by the hour , reports politico . for one thing , no negotiations between republicans and democrats are even on the horizon , because both sides feel they 've already staked out their positions . the hill also thinks a shutdown is " increasingly likely , " and usa today has rolled out a primer on what it would mean to ordinary citizens : yes , you 'll get your mail , and neither medicare , social security , nor medicaid will be affected . but scores of other federal programs and activities will come to a halt : forget visiting a national park or museum , and expect delays in everything from passport applications to gun permits to mortgage approvals . usa today estimates that 40 % of non-defense federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown , and the washington post has details on how the pentagon is scrambling to prepare . in short , it 's a logistical mess , with about 400,000 civilian employees told they 'd have to stay home unless a deal is reached . “ the planning itself is disruptive , ” says the defense department 's comptroller . “ people are worrying right now about whether their paychecks are going to be delayed , rather than focusing fully on their mission . ”
