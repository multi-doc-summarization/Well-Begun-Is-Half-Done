remember the hubbub over this trailer with nsfw puppets ? well , the happytime murders is out friday , starring melissa mccarthy as a detective probing a series of puppet murders with her puppet partner . critics , meanwhile , are busy investigating why the r-rated film is , in their opinions , downright awful . ( the film has a 26 % " fresh " rating on rotten tomatoes . ) what they 're saying : while " there 's a cheeky freshness in the early scenes , " the film " too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long â€¦ probably because the plot is nonsensical and pointless , " james berardinelli writes at reelviews . mccarthy surprisingly does n't help , he writes . she " has the life of a piece of background furniture . " brian truitt argues " mccarthy is as sharp-witted as ever , " but his praise basically ends there . with gags that " make fozzie bear a comedic genius by comparison , " this " scattershot comedy is n't nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is , " he writes at usa today , adding " there are much better uses of your time than this travesty . " " there 's more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks , " johnny oleksinski writes at the new york post , noting the film is " as stale as a neglected saltine . " the prevailing problem : " it 's not funny , " oleksinski writes . in fact , " the only cast member who earns some giggles is maya rudolph . " mara reinstein is just relieved her viewing experience is over . " the happytime murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end . and those 90 minutes in between are excruciating . let me put it in italics for emphasis . excruciating , " she writes at us weekly , calling out the " lazy use of gross-out humor . "
