as the us tries to crack down on iran , iran is doing some cracking down of its ownâ€”on that oh-so-american symbol , the barbie doll . the country 's morality police have begun enforcing a barbie ban issued in 1996 . ( authorities blasted the doll 's " destructive cultural and social consequences " at the time . ) reuters reports that the doll had been stocked on tehran shops ' shelves all the same , until about three weeks ago , when the morality police " came to our shop , asking us to remove all the barbies , " says one shop owner . of course , some barbies are being tucked behind other toys , rather than removed all together , to keep up with demand . if seems that sara and dara , two government-oked dolls released in 2002 , have n't grabbed the hearts and minds of iranian children . one mother says her daughter " prefers barbies . she says sara and dara are ugly and fat . " ( barbie , clearly , to the rescue . ) but what should obedient parents buy for their kiddies instead ? how about a toy soon to hit shelves : a mini rq-170 sentinel stealth drone ... a replica of the one that went down in iran last month . the ap notes that the manufacturer plans to send the us one of the models , in response to washington 's demand that the drone be returned . iranian kids can get theirs for about $ 4 .
