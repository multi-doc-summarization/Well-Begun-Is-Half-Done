leonardo da vinci used oil-based paint to create his mona lisa . the folks at georgia tech used thermochemical nanolithography to create their version , dubbed the " mini lisa , " reports the christian science monitor . the result ? an almost indescribably small gray-scale copy . think one third the width of a human hair , or .0001 inches wide . the idea here was n't so much to create art as to demonstrate the potential of nanotechnology , says popular science . " this technique should enable a wide range of previously inaccessible experiments and applications in fields as diverse as nanoelectronics , optoelectronics , and bioengineering , " says a physics professor at the school . the process involved a microscopic beam and the meticulous application of heat to create lighter or darker shades of gray . gizmag has a detailed description with illustrations . ( is this better than beaming the mona lisa to the moon ? )
