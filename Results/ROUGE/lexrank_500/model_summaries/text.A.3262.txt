the group responsible for an armed anti-muslim protest at a dallas-area mosque last weekend posted a list containing the names and addresses of dozens of muslims and " muslim sympathizers " to facebook on wednesday , the dallas morning news reports . according to the huffington post , the list contained personal information about more than 60 people pulled from an official document of individuals who signed up to speak at a city council debate on " limiting muslim influence " earlier this year . “ this is the first time i ’ ve been slightly alarmed , " the head of a local islamic group tells the morning news . " they were just being good citizens to show up and be a part of the democratic process . now they are targets. ” david wright led the armed protest outside the irving islamic center last weekend and appears to be behind the list , which has since been removed from facebook , the morning news reports . while wright 's organization , bair , states its intention is n't to intimidate anyone , people whose names were on the list say it could n't have been meant for any other reason than to put a target on their backs . the washington post quotes a number of facebook posts from wright this week , including , " we like to have guns designed to kill people that pose a threat in a very efficient manner , " and " my gun is an assault weapon ... it 's a weapon designed to assault people not animals . " the list may have backfired : the morning news notes rsvps for a pro-muslim rally scheduled for saturday at the mosque had more than doubled in 24 hours .
