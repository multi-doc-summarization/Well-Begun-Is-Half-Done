this winter 's flooding in northern california has done more than bring relief after years of drought ; it 's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years . gold hunters in the area tell the chico enterprise-record the floods have " rearranged the rivers " and " move things around . " that means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed . according to cbs san francisco , the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver . while kcra reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding , the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded . right now , rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control . but in the summer—which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997—stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting . " i 'm going to have a ball , " one prospector tells the chico newspaper . the epicenter for the new gold rush could be the oroville dam , which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time . ( this treasure hunter is seeking $ 1 billion in gold from a sunken ship . )
