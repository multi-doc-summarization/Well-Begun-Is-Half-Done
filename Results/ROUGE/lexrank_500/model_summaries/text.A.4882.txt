a " mini-mammoth " the size of a baby elephant has been identified on the island of crete . mammuthus creticus is the tiniest mammoth ever found , and is another example of " dwarfism " on islands , where scare resources can keep animals small , notes the telegraph . fossilized teeth of the three-foot-tall mammoth were first discovered in 1904 , but were initially believed to be elephant teeth . scientists only recently re-examined them and determined they were evidence of a miniature mammoth . they also returned to the spot in crete and discovered a mini leg bone . " dwarfism is a well-known evolutionary response of large mammals to island environments , " said lead researcher victoria herrige from london 's natural history museum . " our findings show that on crete , island dwarfism occurred to an extreme degree , producing the smallest mammoth known so far . " researchers believe the animals may have evolved from regular-sized mammoths as long as 3.5 million years ago .
