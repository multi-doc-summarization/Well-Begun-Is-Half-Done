wikileaks founder julian assange has singled out facebook as an " appalling spying machine " in an interview with russia today . assange warned in an earlier speech at cambridge university that information gathered on the web could be used by governments to spy on its citizens . but this time he called " facebook in particular the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented . here we have the world ’ s most comprehensive database about people , their relationships , their names , their addresses , their locations and their communications , all accessible to us intelligence . facebook , google , yahoo—all these major us organizations have built-in interfaces for us intelligence , " he added . " everyone should understand that when they add their friends to facebook they are doing free work for the us intelligence agencies , " he warned . he conceded that facebook is n't working for or following orders from us intelligence , but said that the government is " able to bring to bear legal and political pressure " on the company . in response to assange 's interview , a facebook spokesman told the new york daily news that the company only turns over information when " legally required to do so . " the " legal standards for compelling a company to turn over data are determined by the laws of the country , and we respect that standard , " the spokesman noted .
