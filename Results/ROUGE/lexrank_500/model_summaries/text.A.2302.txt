president obama looks genuinely worried about the fate of obamacare : he will meet wednesday morning with house and senate democrats to plot strategy on how to prevent republicans from killing it , reports politico . the problem for democrats is that there may not be much they can do in the near future . as both politico and the hill point out , republicans can pass a repeal measure without any democratic support through a legislative maneuver known as a reconciliation vote . the procedure requires only a simple majority , not 60 votes , and the gop has promised to move on it immediately in the new year . the caveat is that , assuming repeal passes , republicans are expected to delay the actual dismantling of the law for quite a while to give them time to craft a replacement . that delay could be as long as three years , reports time . so what can democrats do ? for one thing , raise political pressure . senate democratic leader chuck schumer and his house counterpart , nancy pelosi , plan rallies next month , and obamacare advocates promise to flood the airwaves with ads in states such as arizona and nevada , where they think gop senators might be swayed . the idea is not only to try to block repeal itself but to keep as much of the law in place as possible if repeal passes . president-elect trump , for example , has said he would like to keep parts of obamacare intact , notably protections for those with pre-existing conditions . the white house said this month that 6.4 million people had signed up for obamacare before a dec. 19 deadline , up 400,000 from the previous year .
