experts have long suggested that fiber keeps us feeling full because it takes a long time to digest , but new research challenges that notion—and may point the way to a new anti-hunger pill . the key is a short-chain fatty acid called acetate , which emerges as fiber is digested . acetate then makes its way to the brain 's hypothalamus , where it builds up and triggers chemical reactions that tell us we 're full , time reports . researchers reached this conclusion by scanning the progress of a dietary fiber called inulin through the bodies of mice . those mice who ate fatty diets rich in inulin gained less weight than mice who did n't eat inulin . but one electrophysiologist not related to the study points out that the mice were fed dietary fiber levels of about 11 % . he tells nature that at such a level , " the room would be full of mouse farts " —and perhaps the mice were eating less because they felt gassy . the researchers plan to next test the idea in humans . so could we eventually see an acetate-based diet pill ? it 's possible , the telegraph suggests : " the major challenge is to develop an approach that will deliver the amount of acetate needed to suppress appetite but in a form that is acceptable and safe for humans , " a researcher says .
