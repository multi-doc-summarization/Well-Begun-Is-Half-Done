looks like jerry seinfeld has trumped himself in his quest to make a show about " nothing . " his new web series , comedians in cars getting coffee , has seinfeld chatting with comedy buddies ( like larry david and ricky gervais ) while driving , snacking , and—you guessed it—having coffee . reviews are mixed after the first episode : " if you 're a fan of seinfeld , or its awkward stepchild curb your enthusiasm , you 'll be charmed , " writes guy adams at the independent . " if not , you may find things meander . " still , " there 's at least a whiff of innovation " because the show " can only be watched over the internet . " " the whole aesthetic is a little distancing , and it gives the show a feel of watching a 13 1/2-minute long commercial , " writes james poniewozik at time . " but for what ? just for how good a time these guys are having , being themselves , being with each other , having coffee and breakfast at god knows what hour in the day . " seinfeld and david " occasionally graze past weightier topics—david reveals that his decision to stop drinking coffee helped lead to his divorce—but for the most part , the episode feels like seinfeld boiled down to its essential spirit : highly entertaining talk about the trivialities of life , with no silly 'plot ' to get in the way , " writes adam vary at entertainment weekly 's popwatch blog . " the first episode has enough for car and comedy fans alike to come back for next week , " writes travis okulski at jalopnik . " however , will seinfeld have the same rapport with comics he is n't as close to he does with david ? and will the cars be as interesting ? i hope . " see the show 's first episode on crackle .
