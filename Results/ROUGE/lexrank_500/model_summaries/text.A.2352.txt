just weeks after france unveiled a plan to ban sales of gas and diesel cars by 2040 , its neighbor to the north is following suit . britain 's government on wednesday unveiled a nearly $ 4 billion plan to improve air quality that would see sales of new gas and diesel cars end by 2040 . " poor air quality is the biggest environmental risk to public health in the uk and this government is determined to take strong action in the shortest time possible , " a government rep says , per the guardian . the plan , which includes few concrete promises , sets aside $ 1.3 billion in funding for ultra-low-emission vehicles , plus more for low-emission taxis , and nearly $ 1.6 billion to promote cycling and walking . money is also designated to retrofit public transport and improve air quality on roadways . poor air quality , worsened by rising levels of nitrogen oxides from car exhaust , is tied to an estimated 40,000 deaths in the uk each year , including some 9,000 in london , plus billions in lost productivity , per the bbc . " we ca n't carry on with diesel and [ gas ] cars , " uk environment secretary michael gove told the bbc , via cnnmoney . " there is no alternative to embracing new technology . " but meeting the government 's goal wo n't be an easy feat . demand for electric , fuel cell , and hybrid cars spiked 40 % in the uk in 2015 , but those cars only made up less than 3 % of the market . the ceo of the society of motor manufacturers and traders notes consumers still have " concerns over affordability , range , and charging points " for low-emission vehicles .
