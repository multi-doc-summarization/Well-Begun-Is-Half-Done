chanel 's show at paris fashion week yesterday had a somewhat pedestrian theme : the grand palais , where the show was held , was turned into a chanel supermarket . there were rows of food and household items , all with chanel-branded names like coco beer and tweed cola , and models pushed shopping carts or carried baskets through the aisles while music and fake announcements played ( " the young marine is waiting for her parents at the cashiers , " for example ) ; signs advertised " sales " â€”like " 1 for the price of 2 " and " 50 % markup . " altogether , more than 100,000 items were displayed with more than 500 different labels ; some will be donated to charity , reuters reports , but others were grabbed by audience members after the show ... and things got so crazy that security guards had to intervene , with the ap noting fashionistas ' bags were actually searched upon exit , with stolen goods removed , though one apparently made off with a chanel doormat . " for me the supermarket is the pop art of today , " said designer karl lagerfeld ... though of course he also said he himself rarely actually visits supermarkets . chanel last made headlines for featuring models in sneakers .
