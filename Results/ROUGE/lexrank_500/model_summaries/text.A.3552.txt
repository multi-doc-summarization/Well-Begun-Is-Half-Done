peter jackson 's crafts a fantastic vision of the afterlife in the lovely bones , say critics , but some feel it came at the expense of the human side of the story of a murdered teen , adapted from the book by alice sebold . " by turns warmly sentimental , serial-killer sinister , and science-fiction fantastical , the lovely bones was an unlikely book to achieve worldwide success , " kenneth turan writes in the los angeles times . " those mismatched elements come back to haunt " the film version , " making the final product more hit-and-miss than unblemished triumph . " " sebold 's lovely bones is fleshed out with the perilous , irresistible power of sexâ€”a real world of extramarital sex and sex between young lovers in addition to the heinous rape from which moviegoers are shielded . " but jackson " shies from the challenge , shortchanging a story that is n't only about the lightness of souls in heaven but also about the urges of bodies on earth , " writes lisa schwarzbaum at entertainment weekly . " through jackson 's art " and the magic of star saoirse rogan , richard corliss writes at time , " the obscenity of child murder has been invested with immense gravity and grace . " " some books are not meant to be adapted to the big screen , " and the lovely bones is one of them , writes claudia puig at usa today . what works in the book , she writes , comes off as " artificial and emotionless on-screen .
