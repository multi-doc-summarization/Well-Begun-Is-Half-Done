" it was just an incredible feeling , just amazing . " reclaiming their friendship after nearly half a century , they plan to " share a beer every now and then " and see " a lot more of each other , " says watson . " grow very old and watch our grandchildren grow up , " adds dave . " it 's just great to see him alive . it makes me happy . " ( read about a guy apparently outed as " fake " army veteran . )
