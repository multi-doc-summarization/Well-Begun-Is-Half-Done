imagine you 're in the middle of law class lecture on vigilantes , when a man bursts in , jumps on a desk , announces that he 's making a " citizen 's arrest , " and then pepper sprays the professor . because that 's exactly what happened at george mason university yesterday , and no , it was n't a planned part of the lecture . the professor , popular libertarian economics blogger and occasional new york times columnist tyler cowen , ran into the hall , and the intruder chased him , abc 7 reports . luckily , a student in the class was an off-duty police officer , and chased down the pepper sprayer , catching him at a building exit . multiple charges are now pending against the sprayer . twelve to 15 people , including cowen , were treated for breathing issues , but cowen was soon well enough to tweet that he was back to work , raw story points out .
