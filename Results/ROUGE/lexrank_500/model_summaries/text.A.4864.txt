a distant relative of joseph james deangelo hoping to learn more about their family submitted a dna sample to a genealogy website . they now know that they 're related to a suspected serial killer . police say they tracked the suspected golden state killer by comparing dna from one of his many crime scenes to genetic information freely available online , the sacramento bee reports . they traced family trees for possible suspects and singled out deangelo , a 72-year-old ex-cop , last thursday . sacramento county district attorney anne marie schubert says deangelo was placed under surveillance , and dna collected from discarded items provided " astronomical evidence " that he was the killer . schubert tells the bee that when she was informed of the dna test results , " i probably used a few words i would n't put in a newspaper , but basically said , 'you 'd better not be lying to me . ' " she adds : " there were a lot of holy s -- - moments . " deangelo was arrested outside his home tuesday . the san jose mercury news reports that investigators used the open-source genealogy website gedmatch.com to search for the suspect who committed 12 murders and more than 50 rapes between 1974 and 1986 . other genealogy websites , including ancestry.com and 23andme , say they were n't contacted by police about the case and that they never provide customer information to law enforcement unless they 're legally compelled to . ( neighbors describe deangelo as a " nice old grandpa " obsessed with lawn care . )
