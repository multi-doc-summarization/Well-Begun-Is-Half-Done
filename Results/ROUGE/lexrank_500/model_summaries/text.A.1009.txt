womp womp . according to critics , the transformers franchise should have been kept to a trilogy . the fourth installment of this robot-smashing series , transformers : age of extinction , is getting the nod from just 20 % of critics on rotten tomatoes . the upside ? it has a 74 % approval rating from audiences . here 's what the critics had to say : " do you ever think to yourself , gee , i wish someone would beat on my skull with a hammer today ? if so , you 're in luck , " writes tom long at the detroit news . essentially , it 's two hours and 45 minutes of " absolute garbage . " it 's " repetitive beyond belief , soulless , and shamelessly , endlessly chaotic . " " to give bay his due , transformers is a testament to advances in cgi , " david hiltbrand explains at the philadelphia inquirer . but the stunning moments are " drowned out in the excessive uproar of this clanking cinematic claptrap , " he writes , adding the noise itself " may cause hearing damage . ... go if you must , but bring earplugs . " how does mark wahlberg do in the starring role ? well , he 's " an upgrade on shia labeouf , although it hardly matters , " writes james berardinelli at reelviews . " people in bay films are as interesting and important as background decor . " however , " stanley tucci manages to rise above the material and leave an impression . " bay does n't seem " to understand or care where this noise goes anymore , " writes peter howell at the toronto star . he sums up transformers : age of extinction thusly : " it 's long , it 's loud , and it 's really stupid . " he even feels the need to repeat that sentence twice . he then adds it 's not even " mildly tolerable as time-wasting trash . "
