scientists still do n't know what causes multiple sclerosis , but new research suggests that a particular strain of food poisoning may play a role , reports the bbc . the food bacterium in question is called clostridium perfringens , which nbc news notes is responsible for millions of cases of foodborne illnesses per year , often through undercooked meat . a rare strain of it produces a toxin called epsilon , and the researches found that this toxin attacks the brain in the same way that ms does . “ to me , if you were going to design a trigger for this disease , this would really fit the mold really well , ” says a researcher at weill cornell medical college in new york . he adds that it 's far too early to conclude that the toxin causes ms , only that it appears to activate it . if further study backs up the finding , it could theoretically lead to a vaccine that prevents ms , says another of the weill cornell researchers quoted in medical news today .
