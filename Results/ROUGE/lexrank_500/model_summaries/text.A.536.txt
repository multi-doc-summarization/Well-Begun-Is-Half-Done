should it ever erupt , a supervolcano beneath yellowstone national park could blanket north america in an ash cloud , wipe out communications , and alter the climate . given that eruptions of supervolcanoes buried on our planet—and there are several—are thought to occur every 100,000 years or so , however , the likelihood of such an event during your lifetime is small , reports the new york times . as comforting as that may be , new research out of arizona state university is far less so . whereas researchers previously thought such an eruption would be centuries or millennia in the making , an analysis of fossilized ash left over from yellowstone 's last supereruption 630,000 years ago reveals the process could take only decades . tiny crystals left over from underground magma at yellowstone show the first sign of the last supereruption was a spike in temperature that coincided with the movement of new magma into the reservoir beneath the supervolcano . the crystals also reveal a supereruption followed much quicker than scientists previously thought—perhaps within decades , or what popular mechanics calls " a geologic snap of the finger . " this is the first indication that " the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime , " which one researcher describes as " shocking , " per the times . for now , though , you can rest easy . the lead scientist at the yellowstone volcano observatory tells national geographic there 's no sign of any " magmatic event " at this time . ( you might outrun a supervolcano 's lava anyway . )
