" this spearhead ... could include several thousand troops , ready to respond where needed with air , sea , and special-forces support , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reporters . the nato summit in newport , wales , is especially important because " russia thought it can change the borders of a sovereign european country by force , and this is happening not very far from nato 's borders , " says estonian prime minister taavi roivas , calling for fresh plans to ensure all members of the alliance are " equally and strongly protected . " russian defense chiefs , meanwhile , say nato 's actions are " evidence of the desire of us and nato leaders to continue their policy of aggravating tensions with russia " and that moscow plans to craft a new military doctrine in response to nato plans and the ukraine crisis , the bbc reports . in ukraine , president petro poroshenko accused russia of " direct and undisguised aggression " yesterday as government forces continued to suffer reverses , including a retreat from the luhansk airport , where the ukrainian military says a russian tank battalion supported pro-russia rebels , reuters reports .
