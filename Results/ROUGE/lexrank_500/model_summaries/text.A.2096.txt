there 's not fact checking , and then there 's ... not even using your brain . a newscast on bay area fox affiliate ktvu apparently fell for a ( racist and offensive ) joke , incorrectly reporting that the pilots of the plane that crashed at san francisco airport were named " sum ting wong , " " ho lee fuk , " " bang ding ow , " and " wi tu lo , " sf weekly reports . the network later apologized , but said an ntsb official in washington had " confirmed " them . it was n't exactly an official . per the ntsb : " earlier today , in response to an inquiry from a media outlet , a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft . " the kicker , as mediabistro notes , is that ktvu had just been boasting about its " 100 % accurate " coverage of the disaster earlier this week .
