scientists are now saying there may have been " a more colorful jurassic world than we previously imagined , " thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in china 's hebei province . reuters reports that a closer look at the " exquisitely preserved , " almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that caihong juji had luminous , brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds . the study in the journal nature communications documenting the find explains that " caihong " means " rainbow " in mandarin . scientists think the colorful plumage , which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature 's head , neck , and chest areas , may have kept the dinosaur warm , as well as attracted potential mates ; national geographic compares it to peacock feathers . so how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones ? they used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil , detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes , which underlie pigmentation . which colors they led to can be found by their shapes , and the melanosomes in caihong were long and flat like pancakesâ€”similar to those found in hummingbirds , which boast iridescent plumage . although they ca n't pick out from the pantone wheel caihong 's exact colors , researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a " rainbow glimmer . " study co-author xing zu tells national geographic that caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree . and " glide " is the operative word , as this dinosaur likely did n't fly : its feathers were located on its tail , not on its wings like birds , discover notes . ( a study postulated that nearly all dinosaurs had feathers . )
