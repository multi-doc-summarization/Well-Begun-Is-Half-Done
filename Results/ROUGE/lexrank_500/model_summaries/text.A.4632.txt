" embeddedness , " or the number of mutual friends two people have , can show how close those people are ( the more mutual friends , the closer they are ) . but researchers found embeddedness predicted the correct significant others just 24.7 % of the time . a more accurate predictor is something called " dispersion . " that means researchers looked at how many networks were shared between two people , working on the theory that your romantic partner will have met your family and your current friends and co-workers , as well as old friends from high school or college . by looking at which friend was the most dispersed across all of a facebook user 's networks , researchers upped their accuracy at predicting significant others to 50 % . " a spouse or romantic partner is a bridge between a person â€™ s different social worlds , " one researcher explains , according to the new york times . oh , and dispersion also works to predict the health of your relationship : the more dispersion a user had with his or her partner , the more likely the relationship was to last at least 60 days .
