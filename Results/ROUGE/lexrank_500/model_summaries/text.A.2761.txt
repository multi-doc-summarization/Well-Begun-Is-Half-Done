greenland is n't just losing manhattan-sized chunks of ice from its huge glaciers . a heat-dome that moved over greenland on july 8 caused surface melt to soar from 40 % to an unprecedented 97 % in just four days , reports live science . typically , just half of greenland 's surface ice melts during the summer . " this was so extraordinary that at first i questioned the result : was this real or was it due to a data error ? " said one researcher . there were even signs of ice melt at summit station in central greenland , a point two miles high and near the thickest part of the ice sheet . " ice cores from summit show that melting events of this type occur about once every 150 years on average , " said one glaciologist . " with the last one happening in 1889 , this event is right on time . " however , she cautioned that such a wide-ranging melt was rare and a potential warning . " if we continue to observe melting events like this in upcoming years , it will be worrisome , " she told the guardian .
