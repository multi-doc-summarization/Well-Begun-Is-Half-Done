despite the general opinion after a video surfaced of her kicking syrian migrants , hungarian petra laszlo says she is " not a heartless , child-kicking , racist camera-person . " rather , " something snapped in my head " when hundreds of migrants broke through a police barricade not far from the serbian border in roszke , hungary , and " one of them ran into me , " laszlo writes in a letter , per afp and new york times . " as i had my camera in my hand i could n't see who was coming at me , my only thought was that i was going to be attacked , and that i had to defend myself . " laszlo , who was filmed kicking a child and tripping a man with a child in his arms , says , " as a mother i 'm particularly sorry that fate had it that a child was running at me , and i was n't able to sense that . " she adds , " i honestly regret what i have done and take responsibility for it , " but she says she does n't " deserve either the political witch hunt that is going on against me or the smears or the many death threats â€¦ it 's not easy to make a good decision when you 're in a panic . " laszlo has since been fired from internet-based station n1tv and faces criminal charges of breaching the peace .
