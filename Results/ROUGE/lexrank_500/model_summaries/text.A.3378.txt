way to go , humanity . for the first time in history , human-induced climate change has been found " solely or primarily " responsible for the extinction of a mammal species , according to a new study . the bramble cay melomys , or mosaic-tailed rat , was found by europeans on a tiny coral cay off the coast of queensland , australia , in 1845 and became known as the only mammal species endemic to the great barrier reef , reports the guardian . but though there were hundreds still in existence on bramble cay in 1978 , the last were spotted by a fisherman in 2009 , reports afp . researchers from the university of queensland and the queensland government—who traveled to bramble cay in 2014 and laid 150 traps for six nights to no avail—say " the only known population of this rodent is now extinct . " researchers found the cay , which sits about 10 feet above sea level , had flooded several times , wiping out the animals and their habitat . just 2.5 hectares of land remained above high tide , reports newsweek . " significantly , this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change , " the researchers say—though they hope the animals reached the island on debris from papua new guinea and still survive there . researchers say extreme weather was a factor in the extinction of the little swan island hutia , a rodent once found on an atoll off honduras , but cats were also to blame . " if this is one of the first " extinctions solely linked to humans , " it is more than likely not going to be the last , " says an ecologist . " species restricted to small , low lying islands , or those with very tight environmental requirements are likely to be the first to go . " ( five islands have already vanished . )
