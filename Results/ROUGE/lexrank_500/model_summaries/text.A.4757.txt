" dystopian " and " horrifying " are just two adjectives tim maughan uses to describe for the bbc what he recently witnessed in the remote industrial city of baotou in inner mongolia . most disturbing was his visit to a man-made lake filled with toxic sludge that makes the surrounding area smell like sulfur , wielding an environmental impact that has turned the place into what maughan says is " like hell on earth . " the wasteland is the site of one of the world 's largest rare-earth-mineral productions , where processing plants churn out cerium oxide , neodymium , and other rare earth elements necessary for everything from consumer electronics ( cellphones , tablet touchscreens ) to the magnets in " green " products such as wind turbines and electric car motors , per the bbc . the unfortunate byproduct of this venture : the dangerous chemical waste in the lake right outside of the city , maughan notes . china claims the lion 's share of the world 's production of these minerals : livescience has reported it produced about 95 % of our rare earth elements in 2009 . a local pol told the guardian in 2012 that before the factories were erected in the late '50s , " there were watermelons , aubergines , and tomatoes . " but maughan—who traveled there with a design research group to " [ trace ] back the route consumer goods take from china to our shops and homes " —now found just abandoned outposts , " huge diesel-belching coal trucks , " and the sludge-filled lake . " nothing prepared me for the sight , " he writes . " it 's a truly alien environment . … the thought that it is man-made depressed and terrified me , as did the realization that this was the byproduct not just of the consumer electronics in my pocket , but also green technologies like wind turbines and electric cars that we get so smugly excited about in the west . " ( if you need happier environmental news , here 's one good story . )
