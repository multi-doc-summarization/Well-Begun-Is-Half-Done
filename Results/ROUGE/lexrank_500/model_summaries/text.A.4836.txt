marijuana has a reputation for being a safe drug , but some researchers say there is mounting evidence that the drug is associated with adverse heart complications . in two new case studies , two young men in germany—ages 23 and 28—with no drugs other than thc in their systems and no known health issues ( though the 28-year-old had used other drugs up until a few years ago ) , both died due to complications from abnormal heart rhythms , or arrhythmias . " after exclusion of other causes of death , we assume that the young men died from cardiovascular complications evoked by smoking cannabis , " the researchers conclude . they added that the two men may have also been predisposed to cardiovascular risks . though the researchers tell livescience there have been some " quite unpleasant reactions from individuals " following their report , and while some researchers say there is n't a strong enough link to implicate marijuana , there is mounting evidence that there are " marijuana-associated adverse cardiovascular effects , especially in young people , " an author of a similar study said in an american heart association statement . either way , one toxicologist says people should proceed with caution : " some people who are predisposed to cardiac events may be particularly vulnerable to potential harmful effects of marijuana use , and the new report shows this . " ( berkeley , meanwhile , recently voted to give free medical marijuana to the poor . )
