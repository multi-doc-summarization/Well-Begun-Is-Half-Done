here 's mitt romney 's assessment of the dark knight massacre that claimed 12 lives : different gun laws would not have made any difference . even though the candidate has supported stricter gun controls in the past , he said on cnbc yesterday : " i still believe that the second amendment is the right course to preserve and defend , and i do n't believe that new laws are going to make a difference in this type of tragedy . " he called colorado 's gun laws " very stringent , " adding : " our challenge is not the laws . our challenge is people who , obviously , are distracted from reality and do unthinkable , unimaginable , inexplicable things . " romney backed a ban on assault weapons—including the ar-15 used in the aurora rampage—when he was governor of massachusetts . the weapons are legal in colorado , where few modifications have been made to gun laws since the columbine massacre . “ i believe the people should have the right to bear arms , but i don ’ t believe that we have to have assault weapons as part of our personal arsenal , ” romney said on fox news in 2004 . he wo n't get much push-back from president obama , who also plans not to take any action on stricter gun control laws in the wake of the bloodbath .
