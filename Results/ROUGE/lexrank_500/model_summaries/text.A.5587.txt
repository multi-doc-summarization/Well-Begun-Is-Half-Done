things are n't going as well as it might seem for " clock kid " ahmed mohamed , according to lawyers his family has hired to investigate the texas teen 's treatment by police . " there â€™ s a problem when you have a 14-year-old child arrested in school and basically humiliated in front of his classmates , his teachers , his friends , and basically the whole world , " attorney thomas bowers tells the dallas morning news . " he may be smiling on the outside , but he 's having some issues . " ahmed 's father says he wo n't be returning to the high school that suspended him after a teacher thought his homemade clock was a bomb . the family 's lawyers initially said they were looking at ways to get the clock back from authorities in irving , but police say they decided to return it to him last week and the family can pick it up anytime , buzzfeed reports . the lawyers tell the morning news that they are n't sure yet what legal action the family will take , but they feel that authorities , including irving 's mayor , have tried to " blame the victim , " and now that they 've been hired , " they 'll probably cease comments like that . " it 's not clear when the family will get a chance to pick up the now-famous clock : ahmed will meet with un dignitaries in new york today and his father plans on a trip to mecca , as well as a white house visit .
