disney 's christopher robin sees its adult namesake ( ewan mcgregor ) reunited with his childhood friend winnie the pooh ( jim cummings ) outside the hundred acre wood and just in time , as life in post-world war ii london is pretty gloomy . what critics are saying about marc forster 's latest : " it 's a movie every bit as messy as its 'hunny'-craving bear , though only somewhat as lovable , " writes christopher lawrence at the las vegas review-journal . as it meshes " a somber , artsy meditation on lost childhoods " with a second half meant to engage kids , " the end result may be discordant … but christopher robin still is worth 'oh , bother'-ing to see , " he writes . tom russo at the boston globe calls it " an appealing new spin " on winnie the pooh 's world . appearing much like the vintage book illustrations by eh shepard , " the cg-animated pooh and friends… steal the show , " he writes , noting the script adds " a contemporary flair that 's funny without being obtrusive . " " younger kids might grow a bit fidgety " as the film " gets off to a somewhat slow start , " writes brian lowry at cnn . once it gets going , though , it offers " a genuine sweetness " and serves as " a reminder of the simple pleasures of hanging out with family and a talking bear , which , in these frenetic times , is the kind of silliness that 's worth savoring . " but odie henderson could 've done without " another movie built on the pseudo-psychological cliché that adults need to reconnect with their childhoods in order to be better adults , " especially one led by the hundred acre wood 's " least memorable character . " " it feels as if reality has invaded the hundred acre wood and sullied it , " he writes at rogerebert.com , giving the film two stars .
