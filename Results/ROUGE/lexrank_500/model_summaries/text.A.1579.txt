" when someone is that big in the market , anonymity really goes out the window , " notes a debt trader . the justice department and federal reserve are probing the losses , which experts say should never have been allowed to happen at a bank with government-backed deposits . but jpmorgan remains relatively healthy , despite the losses . the $ 3 billion loss would need to double to wipe out its profit from the second quarter of this year .
