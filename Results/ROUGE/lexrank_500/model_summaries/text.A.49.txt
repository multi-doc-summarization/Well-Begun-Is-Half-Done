pricey mistake : a picasso worth an estimated $ 70 million had to be yanked from an auction at christie 's this week because it sustained damage as workers were preparing it . it 's not clear how bad the damage is to le marin , or the sailor , or even how the damage occurred , but the auction house said in a statement that two outside conservators " have made recommendations for the successful restoration of the painting , " reports abc news . one weird twist : the painting belongs to former casino mogul steve wynn , who previously had bad luck with a different picasso painting . back in 2006 , wynn stuck his elbow through picasso 's le reve while showing it to friends in his las vegas office , reports bloomberg , which adds that wynn has a disease that messes up his peripheral vision . that restoration had a happy ending : the painting had been valued at $ 139 million prior to the damage , and wynn eventually sold it for $ 155 million . this has n't been a stellar year for wynn : he stepped down as ceo of wynn resorts amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations .
