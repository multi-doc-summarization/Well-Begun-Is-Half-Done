neal mcdonough is no longer part of the abc cast of the new scoundrels because the script called for him to do a sex scene . the devout catholic and father of three balked , and he got replaced three days into filming for his trouble , reports radar . mcdonough , 44 , is best known for his roles on desperate housewives , band of brothers , and boomtown . plenty of big-name female actresses refuse to do love scenes , notes margaret eby at salon , but it 's rare to find a guy who draws the line . " it ’ s easy to dismiss mcdonough as out of touch with the industry or perhaps even a religious nut , but the more i thought about it , the more i admired the guy . given the constant turmoil in most stars ’ love lives and how difficult it seems to be to stay married in hollywood , maybe mcdonough ’ s move isn ’ t so much self-defeating as it is smart .
