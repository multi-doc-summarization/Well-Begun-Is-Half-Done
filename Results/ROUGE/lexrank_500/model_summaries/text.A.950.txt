good news for older americans : a new study suggests that their odds of getting dementia are shrinking despite predictions to the contrary . while standardized tests showed 11.6 % of americans 65 and older had dementia in 2000 , only 8.8 % did in 2012 , reports nbc news . what 's more , people are getting dementia later , with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period , reports the new york times . one possible factor : a person 's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years , say university of michigan researchers . " education might actually change the brain itself , " lead author kenneth langa tells npr . " we think that it actually creates more , and more complicated , connections between the nerve cells so that you 're able to keep thinking normally later into life . " another potential factor : while health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes , high blood pressure , and high cholesterol increased , people were treating them with better medications . the study draws on long-range data about 20,000 americans from all kinds of backgrounds , and langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation 's dementia problem might have been been overstated . the alzheimer 's association is n't so sure : though dementia rates may be falling , " the total number of americans with alzheimer 's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically " as the number of older adults climbs , " it says . in the us , the number of people 65 and older is projected to double by 2050 , notes npr . ( a game could reduce your dementia risk . )
