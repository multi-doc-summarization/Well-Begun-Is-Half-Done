former nyc mayor rudy giuliani joined hundreds of demonstrators last night to protest an opening-night opera performance at the met , the new york times reports . protesters shouted " shame on the met ! " and sported signs that read " the met glorifies terrorism , " and it 's all thanks to the death of klinghoffer , the ap reports . the opera , penned by composer john adams , focuses on the murder of leon klinghoffer , an american jewish man in a wheelchair killed by the palestine liberation front during the 1985 hijacking of the achille lauro cruise ship . some believe the opera makes excuses for terrorism , is too sympathetic to the palestinian plight , and " humanizes the hijackers , " writes adam shatz in the london review of books . one man inside the theater yelled , " the murder of klinghoffer will never be forgiven ! " a few times before being removed , while a woman cursed loudly and walked out with an usher escort . even nyc mayors past and present ca n't agree on whether the opera should be performed . giuliani—known for previous attempts to shut down art installations he did n't like , according to the times—told the paper that the opera gives " a distorted view of history , " while current mayor bill de blasio said , " i think the american way is to respect freedom of speech . simple as that . " one protester proclaimed , " go out , murder someone , be a terrorist , and we 'll write a play about you , " while another person at a " counterdemonstration " held a sign that said , " a work of art about a subject is not a work in favor of that subject . " meanwhile , composer adams says , " the really ironic and sad fact is that the content of this opera is more relevant in 2014 than it was even in 1991 , " per details .
