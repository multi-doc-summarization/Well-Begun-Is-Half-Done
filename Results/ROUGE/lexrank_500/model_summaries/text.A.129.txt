roughly two-thirds of american adults have been exposed to the herpes type 1 virus ( oral ; type 2 is the genital one ) , and they could be predisposed to developing alzheimer 's disease later in life . so writes a group of 31 international scientists and clinicians in an editorial in the journal of alzheimer 's disease , stating that " substantial published evidence " suggests such a link and calling on researchers elsewhere to take action . they claim that some microbes—the virus and two types of bacteria , chlamydia and spirochete—are linked to the progressive neurological disease . " we are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that alzheimer 's disease has a dormant microbial component , " writes lead author douglas kell in a university of manchester statement . " we ca n't keep ignoring all of the evidence . " the authors propose that the named microbes " reach the [ central nervous system ] and remain there in latent form . " they can then essentially wake up during the course of aging , under stress , or as the immune system declines . " the consequent neuronal damage ... occurs recurrently , leading to ... ultimately ad , " the authors posit . they point to the failure of 413 alzheimer 's drug trials conducted between 2002 and 2012 and " express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected , " as " antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of ad patients ... could rectify the 'no drug works ' impasse . " meanwhile , not all are convinced , with one neuroscience professor framing theirs as a " minority view " ; he tells the telegraph there has " been no convincing proof of infections causing " the disease . ( this 38-year-old 's form of alzheimer 's is genetic . )
