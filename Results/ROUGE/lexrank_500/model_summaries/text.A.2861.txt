a 43-year-old car-crash victim in italy who fell into a " minimally conscious state " to the point where he could no longer speak suddenly started chatting again after receiving a sedative , livescience reports . a study published in november in restorative neurology and neuroscience said it 's the first case showing " the 'awakening ' effect of midazolam , " a drug typically used to induce sleepiness before surgery . the man was in a coma for 40 days after his accident , then a " vegetative state " for four weeks . he was discharged after 10 months , but his condition worsened : two years after the accident he could n't say a single word or respond to simple commands and was performing " aimless repetitive behaviors " like clapping . doctors treated him with various meds to no avail but then gave him midazolam instead of the usual propofol ( the same drug that killed michael jackson ) before a ct scan . the man suddenly " began to interact with the anesthetist , " then with others , the study notes . the effect wore off after two hours , but doctors were able to replicate the results during a second midazolam dosage . the study notes that patients with catatonia ( a state of unresponsiveness they 're not sure this man suffered from ) have responded to this drug before . because midazolam can only be used in a hospital setting , doctors switched the patient over to carbamazepine ( an epilepsy drug ) , which has since helped the man " maintain the improvement of his ability to interact and communicate with people , " a study co-author tells livescience . interestingly , zolpidem ( often sold under the brand name ambien ) has been " well documented in literature " as evoking response in similar patients , but it did n't work this time , the study notes . ( midazolam has also been cited in botched executions . )
