a prospective student at a community college in baltimore says his outspoken religious beliefs ruined his application—so he 's suing the school and its president , opposing views reports . brandon jenkins interviewed for the community college of baltimore county 's radiation therapy program , and was asked , " what is the most important thing to you ? " his answer : " my god . " according to his lawsuit , filed by the american center for law and justice , the program 's director later told him that his answer did n't help his application . " this field is not the place for religion , " she allegedly said , and advised him against emphasizing religion in future applications because school patients come from various faiths or " believe in nothing at all . " a senior counsel at aclj tells the christian post that jenkins ' rejection is " every bit as unlawful as singling out his race , or singling out his gender , " but a school spokeswoman denies the accusations , the baltimore sun reports . a letter from the school 's attorney , included in the lawsuit , says jenkins ' comment about god " was not a good answer " because the school seeks people driven by a " passion in the field " —but adds that jenkins has a criminal record and would have struggled to find work in maryland .
