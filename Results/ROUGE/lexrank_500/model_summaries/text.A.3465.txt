last month , emerald white 's four pit bulls got into a neighbor 's yard and killed that texas family 's 10-year-old beagle . " everyone was telling me to sue her , but i decided not to because it wo n't bring bailey back , " says steve baker , the beagle 's owner . so imagine his surprise when he and his wife , tiffany , were served with a $ 1 million lawsuit from white on wednesday . in the lawsuit , white says that when she went into the bakers ' texas city yard to get her dogs during the oct. 27 incident , she was " unexpectedly and viciously attacked " and " seriously injured . " she also accuses the bakers of not keeping their dog in a secure enclosure , the galveston county daily news reports . white 's dogs got into the bakers ' yard through a hole in the shared fence between their yards . but in an interview earlier this month , baker told the daily news that each homeowner is responsible for the fence slats that face his or her home , and that " i had replaced all the slats that were my responsibility . i had even replaced a few of [ the neighbors ' ] . " baker also now says that before bailey was killed he tried to speak with the neighbors about fence repairs but got no response . in a report shortly after the attack , the bakers ' daughter told click2houston that their neighbor had repaired the fence after the attack . white 's dogs were ultimately declared dangerous by the city ; they are now required to be in a secure enclosure with a mechanical locking device .
