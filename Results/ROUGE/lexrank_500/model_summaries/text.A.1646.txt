" i think that in the artistic community , directors , curators are tremendously insensitive to christians , " complained catholic league president bill donohue . " you ca n't make fun of the holocaust , you ca n't make fun of black slavery , and you ca n't even depict anything about mohammed . " the " new museum has always defended freedom of expression and continues to oppose censorship , " responded director lisa phillips . " we can not afford to take hard won civil liberties for granted and need to remain vigilant and protect artistic freedom .
