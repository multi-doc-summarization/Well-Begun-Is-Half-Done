former subway pitchman jared fogle wants his child pornography sentence reduced , claiming that the judge who sentenced him was , in part , punishing him for his fantasies , tmz reports . according to the new york daily news , fogle 's plea deal called for a maximum sentence of 12.5 years ; the judge ended up giving him more than 15 . his lawyers claim that longer sentence was partly based on fantasies fogle had but never acted on . as evidence , they quote the judge : " this defendant is obsessed with child pornography and having sex with minors . he fantasized about it in telephone conversations . " fogle filed an appeal for a new sentencing on friday . his appeal calls his current sentence " unreasonable " and says the judge " abused her authority . " fogle admitted to paying for sex with girls who were 16 and 17 , as well as receiving child pornography made by the head of his charity . but he also talked about more sexual contact with minors and getting pornography featuring children as young as 6 . fogle 's lawyers argue it 's those conversations about things he was never charged with that led to the longer sentence . fogle 's sentence is still much shorter that the 50 years the judge could have legally given him .
