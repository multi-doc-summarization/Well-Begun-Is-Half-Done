mike pence promised nato allies saturday that they had the " unwavering " support of the us , while also making it clear that the administration considers most of them to be freeloaders . the vice president , speaking to european leaders at the munich security conference , said european countries are failing to " pay their fair share " on defense , the bbc reports . pence said only four other nato countries—the uk , greece , estonia , and poland—met a commitment to spend at least 2 % of gdp on defense . " the time has come to do more , " pence said , echoing president trump 's campaign rhetoric . pence said the us plans to boost military spending and will " hold russia accountable " for its actions in ukraine . " peace only comes through strength , " pence said , per the wall street journal . " president trump believes we must be strong in our military might . " german chancellor angela merkel also addressed the conference and said germany will increase its spending to meet nato 's target , but it wo n't be rushed into it , the guardian reports . she added that it would be a mistake to believe that defense spending is the only way to boost security . " security is ensured just as much by increasing one ’ s development spending , " she said . merkel said the us was a valuable partner in the fight against terrorism , along with islamic nations who can show " that a misguided islam , rather than islam itself , is the cause of terrorism .
