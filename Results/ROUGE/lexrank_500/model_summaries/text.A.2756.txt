a nonprofit group is throwing in $ 10,000 to sweeten the deal for potential voters in philadelphia for whom the joy of taking part in democracy might not be enough . voter turnout in the city has been declining for a long time and sank to just 27 % in a mayoral primary this may , according to the philadelphia citizen , which is offering the prize in its " 2015 philadelphia municipal election voting lottery . " the group says it will randomly select one of philadelphia 's 1,686 voting divisions when the city votes in local elections on nov. 3 , and will hand a $ 10,000 check to the first voter who emerges at a selected time , the philadelphia inquirer reports . the citizen says the funds will come from the pamela and ajay raju foundation civic group—and the giveaway is completely legal . on its website , the citizen , which was co-founded by former philadelphia daily news editor larry platt , admits that the plan is " sorta icky " —and that a similar giveaway in a los angeles school district was condemned as a " superficial pseudo-solution " to civic malaise—but says " desperate times call for desperate measures , " and the lottery is n't the only scheme underway to try to boost voter turnout . " it 's kind of a cockamamie scheme , " platt tells the daily news . " i want to give away money to see if we can get people to vote . " ( low turnout is n't just a philadelphia problem : the " abysmally low " turnout nationwide last year was the worst since world war ii . )
