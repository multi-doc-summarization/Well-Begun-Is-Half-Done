" i am crying . " that was just one online reaction to an ill-fated photo shoot that was meant to capture a planned stadium implosion . photographers gathered near the georgia dome in downtown atlanta on monday , waiting to snap a shot of the controlled destruction of the 71,000-seat structure , and among them was the weather channel 's james crugnale , who arrived nearly an hour ahead of time to nab his " perfect " vantage point across the street and livestream the gathering crowd , per the washington post . except that it was also the perfect pull-over spot for a city bus , which pulled up right in front of crugnale at the exact moment black smoke started to spew from the top of the dome to mark the beginning of the implosion . " get out of the way , bus ! what the f -- - ? ! " an incredulous crugnale can be heard saying , in between frustrated yells , in the now-viral video of his experience . the bus lingered for less than 20 seconds , but by the time it pulled away , the dome had already disappeared into a massive cloud of white dust . " tfw you stream the # gadome being demolished for 40 minutes and a bus stops in front of the camera at the exact moment it implodes , " crugnale lamented on twitter .
