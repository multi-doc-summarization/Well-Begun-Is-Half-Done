saudi arabia 's 30-year-old deputy crown prince is looking toward the future with his new " vision 2030 " plan—a plan that includes pulling the kingdom out of its overreliance on oil and leaning more on non-oil investment to transform it into a global power , reuters reports . " we will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets , " prince mohammed bin salman told reporters gathered at a riyadh palace monday . per gulf news , he had earlier appeared in a televised al-arabiya interview , noting , " we have developed a case of oil addiction in saudi arabia . … i think by 2020 , if oil stops we can survive . " also part of his new blueprint : including women more in the economy and appealing to young people who face the prospect of not finding jobs . the bbc notes that more than 70 % of the kingdom 's revenue came from oil in 2015 , but oil prices continue to plummet and saudi arabia 's economy is suffering , per al jazeera . in broad terms , the prince would like to bring up its public investment fund ( pif ) capital to $ 2 trillion from $ 160 billion . prince mohammed says 5 % of shares in the aramco oil company would be sold to fund this $ 2 trillion nest ( which he thinks could even rise to $ 3 trillion ) . also part of the prince 's game plan : setting up a " green card " system in five years ' time to expedite muslim and arab expatriates ' long-term residency , as well as boosting affordable housing and getting more women into the workforce . the founder of the dc-based saudi american public relations affairs committee tells al jazeera this a " visionary move , " but another saudi expert says he 's seen similar changes proposed before . " to implement some of these , you need the collaboration of society , " he notes . " for example , if you want to increase the empowerment of women , you need to liberalize your society . " ( what the prince did n't bring up : the kingdom 's possible ties to 9/11 . )
