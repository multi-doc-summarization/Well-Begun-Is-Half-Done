two ships have begun a race against time to try to find the black boxes of malaysia airlines flight 370 before the data recorder 's battery-powered pinger ceases transmission . an australian navy ship towing a pinger locator and a british survey vessel are searching a 150-mile track where the plane could have gone down , reports reuters . " the area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence , " search chief angus houston told reporters . " on best advice the locator beacon will last about a month before it ceases its transmissions so we 're now getting pretty close to the time when it might expire . " the boeing 777 disappeared on march 8 , so the search teams may now have just a few days to locate the signal , the bbc notes . some 14 planes and nine ships are still searching an area of the southern indian ocean for floating wreckage , and houston says there is still a strong possibility of finding debris like lifejackets . " this is a vast area , an area that ’ s quite remote , and we ’ ll continue the surface search for a good deal more time , " he says . " if we find a piece of wreckage on the surface ... that gives us a much better datum to start the underwater search than we ’ ve currently got . "
