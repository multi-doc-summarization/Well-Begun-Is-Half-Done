water for elephants , based on the bestselling book , tells the story of a young man who joins the circus during the depression , working with an elephant and falling for a married performer . critics are mixed : the film “ provides a constant wash of scenic pleasure , ” and is true to the book , writes todd mccarthy in the hollywood reporter . “ but the vital spark that would have made the drama truly compelling on the screen is missing. ” roger ebert welcomes the film . “ in an age of prefabricated special effects and obviously phony spectacle , it 's sort of old-fashioned ( and a pleasure ) to see a movie made of real people and plausible sets , ” he notes in the chicago sun-times . writing in variety , peter debruge cheers the movie . it ’ s “ a splendid period swooner that delivers classic romance and an indelible insider 's view of 1930s circus life. ” but in the new york times , stephen holden strongly disagrees . the “ timid screen adaptation , ” he writes , “ short-circuits the novel ’ s quirky charms and period atmosphere by its squeamish attitude toward gritty circus life . ”
