rick santorum has made it clear that he 's sticking around despite his resounding defeat in illinois . in a rambling election night speech in gettysburg , he described this year 's election as the most important since 1860 , urged supporters to " saddle up , like reagan did in the cowboy movies , " and predicted a big win in louisiana 's primary on saturday , reports the washington post . speaking to fox news , he blamed the illinois loss on being outspent heavily in the chicago media market , and said he did n't think super pacs should exist . in chicago , " which has 70 % of the population of the state of illinois , we got outspent 21 to 1 . we feel like we are up there , running against the machine , ” he said , adding that illinois is a moderate state that elects moderate republicans . romney won , he said , because of a super pac funded by his billionaire friends . a romney spokeswoman said santorum complaining about being outspent was " like a basketball team complaining that they lost to another team because their players are too tall , " politico reports . " that ’ s just ridiculous , " she said . " this is all part of the game . "
