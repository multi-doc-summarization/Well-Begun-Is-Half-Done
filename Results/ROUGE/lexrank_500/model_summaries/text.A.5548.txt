donald trump was pretty pleased with his performance against hillary clinton at monday 's debate , even though scientific polls—not the easily manipulated online polls that trump is citing—show most americans pick clinton as the clear victor . even some of his own campaign advisers do n't feel he was on point enough during the head-to-head , though they 're framing it as " missed opportunities " rather than total failure . and so the strategy for oct. 9 's debate is reportedly getting an overhaul , with more role-playing practice , facts study , and even rehearsing how to move around the stage for the town-hall-style event , per the new york times . what these advisers , who spoke anonymously to the paper , are worried about , however , is whether trump will agree to this prep . complicating things : some say he actually was drilled on how to combat clinton on certain issues and that he just chose not to . others point the finger at trump 's extremely busy schedule in the days before the debate and too many people ( up to a dozen , some with not much political acumen ) giving him conflicting suggestions . sources say his debate training was " unconventional , " with trump unable to concentrate during more traditional sessions and preferring to simply dish with advisers rather than have mock debates . trump himself told fox news he found it hard to segue into some of those challenges against clinton on the debate stage , such as the subject of benghazi . trump 's pulling back—he stopped attacking clinton and even grew " subdued " as the debate proceeded—has got to change the next time around , frustrated aides say . instead , he has to set clinton 's vulnerabilities in his sights and stick to his plan for the whole night . " it clearly looked like he ran out of gas after 30 minutes [ in the new york debate ] , and that came through loud and clear , " a senior political strategist tells the times .
