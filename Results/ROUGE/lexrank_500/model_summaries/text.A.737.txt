politico is out with a damning report about the obama administration 's dealings with iran last year in the lead-up to a nuclear arms accord . the story by josh meyer alleges that former president obama gave up more than he acknowledged publicly , particularly in regard to a prisoner swap ahead of the deal . the obama white house released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen , neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president 's own justice department . ( they 'd been accused of illegally shipping us macroelectronics to tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles . ) what 's more , politico found that the us also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives , including seyed abolfazl shahab jamili , who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for iran by way of china . " they didn ’ t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys , " one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells politico . " and then they didn ’ t give a full story of it . " in fact , meyer writes , the white house actions " derailed " its own successful investigations into iran 's proliferation network , angering justice department prosecutors . a senior obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal . here 's one sample of early reaction , from the conservative hot air site : " barack obama and john kerry desperately needed a win on foreign policy in 2015-6 after seeing its 'smart power ' approach turn the middle east and caucasus into flames , " writes ed morrissey . " they didn ’ t care if it was a short-term win that sacrificed long-term national security . " read the full politico piece here .
