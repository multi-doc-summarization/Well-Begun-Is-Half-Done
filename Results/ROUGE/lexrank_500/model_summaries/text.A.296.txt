the new york times editorial board thinks president obama has the us blundering into a new war with the expanded airstrikes in syria . before the us gets any deeper into the operation , the president should open this up for a full debate in congress , says the editorial . it 's also " puzzling " that in preparing the nation on sept. 10 for these airstrikes , obama said nothing about the khorasan group that is suddenly public enemy no . 1 . " there isn ’ t a full picture—because mr. obama has not provided one—of how this bombing campaign will degrade the extremist groups without unleashing unforeseen consequences in a violent and volatile region , " says the editorial . " in the absence of public understanding or discussion and a coherent plan , the strikes in syria were a bad decision . " agree : the airstrikes are a " major reversal " for a president who opposed intervention in syria for so long , writes the los angeles times in an editorial . can we trust that he wo n't reverse himself on ground troops , too ? yes , isis and the khorasan group pose threats to us interests , " but is the threat serious enough to justify an ever-escalating role for the us military in syria and iraq ? " asks the editorial . " does the us have a clear strategy and achievable aims ? the case has yet to be made . " disagree : the wall street journal editorial board not only applauds the airstrikes but thinks us ground troops should be ready to move quickly . if the mission is to succeed , and it must , they 'll be needed to direct airstrikes as militants hide in populated areas . " no us president should ever start a war he does n't intend to win , and wars rarely go as smoothly as advertised in advance , " concludes the editorial . " now that he has attacked isis , mr. obama must show that america is the strong horse . "
