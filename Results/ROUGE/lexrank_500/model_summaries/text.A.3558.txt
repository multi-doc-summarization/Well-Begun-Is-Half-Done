dan adler is campaigning for jane harman 's vacated house seat , and the california democrat has an odd , possibly offensive reason certain people should vote for him : his wife is korean ! oh , and he himself is jewish , and as his odd campaign ad states , " we minorities should stick together . " on talking points memo , benjy sarlin notes that the most " patronizing " part of the commercial is the " heavily-accented korean immigrant woman in a laundromat awkwardly [ interrupting ] him throughout the ad . " and in new york , dan amira concludes that if adler " did n't have a korean wife , this might one of the most racist campaign ads we 've ever seen . "
