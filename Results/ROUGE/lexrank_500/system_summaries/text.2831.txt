cording to a fascinating new study led by columbia ’ s earth institute and published today the journal the cryosphere , which finds that greenland ’ s “ albedo , ” or reflectivity , has been decreasing since the mid 90s . newline_char greenland is one of the brightest spots on planet earth , but ominously enough , its gleaming surface darkens with each passing year , thanks to a strange series of physical processes , one of which can not be seen with the naked eye . newline_char by the end of the 21st century , greenland could be ten percent darker than it is today . newline_char one  story_separator_special_tag the surface energy balance and meltwater production of the greenland ice sheet ( gris ) are modulated by snow and ice albedo through the amount of absorbed solar radiation . newline_char we suggest that the  story_separator_special_tag greenland 's ice is getting darker , increasing risk of melting feedback loops from melting itself are driving changes in reflectivity greenland 's snowy surface has been getting darker over the past two decades , absorbing more heat from the sun and increasing snow melt , a new study of satellite data shows . newline_char one  newline_char that trend is likely to continue , with the surface 's reflectivity , or albedo , decreasing by as much as 10 percent by the end of the century , the study says . story_separator_special_tag greenland 's surface is absorbing more solar radiation as melting increases grain size and brings old impurities to the surface . newline_char greenland ’ s ice sheet has been darkening for the past two decades , and new research delves into the processes behind this phenomenon . newline_char in a study that used satellite images stretching back decades , scientists have delved into the processes causing 'darkening ' of the greenland ice sheet – its diminishing ability to reflect the sun 's radiation . newline_char an aerial image of greenland shows rivers of meltwater and areas of dark ice .
