the design process was about optimization , pushing the constraints , and opening up the box of solutions , " alain de zotti , chief engineer of the a350 xwb program at airbus , says . newline_char with its a350 xwb jet , airbus integrates the latest design and engineering tricks to quell many of the headaches for flyers , carriers , and pilots . newline_char with $ 15 billion worth of research and development under its belt , airbus is hoping that its no-nonsense approach to design and engineering will help it best the competitionâ€”namely the boeing 787 dreamliner and 777 long-distance planes . newline_char a lighter ride one of the biggest differences in the airbus a350 compared to older models is its composition . newline_char the manufacturer debuted the design in early 2015 , but the first aircraft to land in the united states arrived courtesy of qatar airways last week . newline_char over  newline_char from labyrinthine security checkpoints to cramped seats and scant overhead storage space , air travel ranks among the most grueling experiences out there ( unless you 're one of the rarefied few who spring for first class ) . story_separator_special_tag but commercial aircraft companies airbus and qatar airways think they might have found a solution to the perennial jetlag problem with their latest aeroplane . newline_char again , airbus says this should improve comfort for passengers and minimise the effects of jetlag once they step back onto the ground . newline_char the a350 xwb comes with a variety of improvements designed to minimise that groggy feeling you get from flying halfway around the world . newline_char over  newline_char larger and wider wings , together with newline_char what 's more , the plane 's filtering system refreshes the air inside the cabin every 2 or 3 minutes , and keeps it pressurised at the equivalent of an altitude of 1,828.8 metres ( 6,000 feet ) .
