w , researchers have made a significant advance toward replacing large pieces of bone in humans by growing a pig ’ s own cells into bone in the lab and then using it to restore a piece of missing jaw . newline_char but he says the new technique , now inching toward testing in humans , will still have to prove its advantages over other experimental bone regeneration approaches . newline_char the face is an especially tricky testing ground for bone reconstruction . newline_char today , surgeons often repair facial damage by grafting a piece of bone from somewhere else , such as the patient ’ s pelvis or rib . newline_char but that procedure , called an autograft , creates a whole new bone injury that can be painful and  newline_char break your arm , and it will probably heal—but lose a big chunk of your chin , and that ’ s a different story . story_separator_special_tag we do not capture any email address . newline_char thank you for your interest in spreading the word about science translational medicine . newline_char note : we only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it , and that it is not junk mail . story_separator_special_tag vunjak-novakovic and her colleagues have managed to create living bone from stem cells . newline_char from cow bone , they sculpted a “ scaffold ” — a three-dimensional copy of the pig bone . newline_char the cells attached to the scaffold , forming a new bone identical to the original . newline_char then the researchers implanted the new bone in each pig . newline_char there was no problem with rejection , and the new bone integrated with the pig ’ s own tissue . newline_char considering they ’ d been retrofitted with bone grown in a laboratory , that came as a pleasant surprise .
