ur patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) —two of them in permanent clis and two entering the clis without reliable means of communication—learned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions all requiring a “ yes ” or “ no ” thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fnirs . newline_char if replicated with als patients in clis , these  newline_char despite partial success , communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing , a state called complete locked-in state ( clis ) . newline_char online fnirs classification of personal questions with known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine ( svm ) resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70 % . newline_char based on a motor learning theoretical context and on the failure of neuroelectric brain–computer interface ( bci ) communication attempts in clis , we here report bci communication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fnirs ) and an implicit attentional processing procedure . story_separator_special_tag using a device which detects patterns in brain activity , patients paralysed by als can answer ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ – and tell doctors they are ‘ happy ’ with life doctors have used a brain-reading device to hold simple conversations with “ locked-in ” patients in work that promises to transform the lives of people who are too disabled to communicate . newline_char the groundbreaking technology allows the paralysed patients – who have not been able to speak for years – to answer “ yes ” or “ no ” to questions by detecting telltale patterns in their brain activity . newline_char “ it ’ s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever , because with all of these patients , we can now ask them the most critical questions in life , ” said niels birbaumer , a neuroscientist who led the research at the university of tübingen .
