amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton of nasa 's goddard space flight center and the study 's lead author said in a press release . newline_char nasa scientists have determined via an innovative satellite technique that a certain type of wildfire in the amazon rainforest is responsible for destroying several times more forest than that lost through deforestation in regards to recent years . story_separator_special_tag " amazon forests are quite vulnerable to fire , given the frequency of ignitions for deforestation and land management at the forest frontier , but we 've never known the regional extent or frequency of these understory fires , " doug morton , a researcher at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , md. newline_char signs of damage appear in the year after the fires occur , and then gradually disappear as the rain forest recovers , the nasa statement said . newline_char these fires destroy several times more forest than is taken out by deforestation each year , according to a new study , published recently in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b . newline_char but between 1999 and 2010 , these forest fires burned more than 33,000 square miles ( 85,500 square kilometers ) , an area larger than the state of south carolina , according to a nasa release . newline_char a new satellite imaging technique has allowed scientists to see amazonian fires burning beneath the jungle canopy , called " understory fires , " which were previously difficult to detect . newline_char unlike fires in the amazon 's grassy areas , which can spread rapidly and are known to have towering flames , understory fires burn nearly undetected .
