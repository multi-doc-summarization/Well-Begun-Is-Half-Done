e ventrolateral frontal cortex area of the brain is involved in many of the highest aspects of cognition and language , and is only present in humans and other primates . newline_char a better understanding of the neural connections and networks involved should help the understanding of changes in the brain that go along with these conditions . newline_char the psychologists behind a new mri study say it is key components in the ventrolateral frontal cortex area of the human brain , and how these components were connected up with other brain areas . newline_char we 've identified an area of the brain that appears to be uniquely human and is likely to have something to do with these cognitive powers , " says senior researcher professor matthew rushworth of oxford university 's department of experimental psychology.the brain is a mosaic of interlinked areas . story_separator_special_tag ball of tissue named lateral frontal pole found to be crucial in analysing alternative decisions â€“ and may be unique to humans a new brain region that appears to help humans identify whether they have made bad decisions has been discovered by researchers . newline_char while other brain parts keep track of how well , or not , our decisions are working for us , the new structure is more outward-looking , and mulls over what we might have done instead . newline_char scientists spotted the region , named the lateral frontal pole , after scanning the brains of healthy humans in two different ways . newline_char " we know there are differences between humans and monkeys . newline_char further scans failed to find any comparable region in monkeys , suggesting the area is exclusive to humans . newline_char " there are a few brain areas that monitor how good our choices are , and that is a very sensible thing to have .
