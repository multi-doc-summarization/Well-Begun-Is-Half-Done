t research from paul hartogh of germany 's max planck institute for solar system research and colleagues published on wednesday showed a comet called 103p/hartley 2 has the same chemical composition as the earth 's oceans . newline_char astronomers have found the first comet with ocean-like water in a major boost to the theory that the celestial bodies were a significant source of water for a thirsty early earth . newline_char london ( reuters ) - astronomers have found the first comet with ocean-like water in a major boost to the theory that the celestial bodies were a significant source of water for a thirsty early earth . newline_char the puzzle is where the water , which is vital for life on earth , came from . story_separator_special_tag image caption comet hartley 2 was also the subject of the deep impact probe study comet hartley 2 contains water more like that found on earth than all the comets we know about , researchers say . newline_char meteoritic material has roughly the same proportion of deuterium that the earth 's oceans contain , and so the assumption has been that if water arrived from elsewhere , it came from asteroids . newline_char a study using the herschel space telescope aimed to measure the fraction of deuterium , a rare type of hydrogen , present in the comet 's water . newline_char just a few million years after its formation , the early earth was rocky and dry ; most likely , something brought the water that covers most of the planet today . newline_char water has something of a molecular fingerprint in the amount of deuterium it contains , and only about half a dozen comets have been measured in this way - and all of them have exhibited a deuterium fraction twice as high as the oceans .
