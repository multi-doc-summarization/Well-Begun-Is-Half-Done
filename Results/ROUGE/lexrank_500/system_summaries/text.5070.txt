t behavioural assessments have n't been helpful in predicting who will get autism , says joseph piven , a psychiatrist at the university of north carolina ( unc ) in chapel hill , who co-led the study , published online in nature1 . newline_char the findings raise the prospect of diagnosing autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) months before children develop symptoms , a goal that has proved elusive . story_separator_special_tag the results revealed that early brain development biomarkers could be helpful in determining which high-risk babies will go on to develop autism . newline_char from the scans , researchers were able to correctly predict 80 percent of those infants who would later meet criteria for autism at 2 years of age . newline_char experimental research may lead to a new method to diagnose infants with autism before symptoms show . newline_char in what they say is a first-of-its-kind study , researchers used magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) to examine the brains of infants at high risk for autism – those whose older siblings had the disorder – at 6 months , 12 months , and 24 months of age . story_separator_special_tag images revealed which infants would go on to have an autism diagnosis , raising hopes for earlier care and interventions for those affected babies who are most at risk of developing autism as toddlers have been identified from brain scans in the first year of life . newline_char brain scans of premature babies reveal changes that may raise risk of autism read more scientists studied 106 babies , all of whom had an older brother or sister with autism , and found that telltale features in brain images taken at six and 12 months revealed which infants would go on to have an autism diagnosis . newline_char the images helped doctors spot which of a group of children who were already at risk because of autism in the family would later be diagnosed with the condition .
