british biotechnology company called oxitec has genetically engineered a new breed of olive tree fly that could stop their natural counterparts from ravaging olive trees in spain . newline_char the scientists have engineered dengue-carrying mosquitoes around the city of mandacaru to produce offspring that will all die before they can reproduce . newline_char see also : 9 bug videos that will make you squirm olive tree fly larvae eat through 15 % to 30 % of the crop each year , making them much more than a nuisance to anyone whose income depends on the fruit . newline_char the altered flies are implanted with a gene that causes female offspring to die in the larval stage . newline_char in a controlled experiment conducted by the uk scientists , according to new scientist , the population crashed in about 10 weeks . newline_char for now , oxitec is waiting for the go-ahead from the national biosafety commission in spain . story_separator_special_tag to tackle this , oxitec , a biotech company based in oxford , uk , has submitted an application to the national biosafety commission in spain to release a small contingent of male gm olive flies , in what would be the first field trial of its kind in europe . newline_char genetically modified versions of a fly that decimates olive trees could soon be released in spain in an attempt to control the pests . newline_char and in brazil , gm mosquitoes are already at large as part of the biggest project yet involving engineered insects . newline_char the olive fruit fly is a major pest to olive growers in the mediterranean and california . newline_char the idea is that the male offspring inherit the lethal genes and newline_char the males are equipped with genes that cause any female offspring they sire to die while they are still in the larval stage , before they have had a chance to reproduce .
