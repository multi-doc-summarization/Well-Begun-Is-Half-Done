rlier this month , nasa published the below video introducing its concept submarine designed to explore kraken mare , one of the methane seas on titan , the remarkably strange moon circling saturn . newline_char verne saw us flying around the world , traveling to the center of the earth ( not a great idea , it turns out ) and to the moon , but i bet he never imagined that just 110 years after his death , we 'd be working on a robot submarine to probe the flammable seas of a distant world . newline_char getting the sub to titan presents a bit of challenge since it wo n't fit into the sphere-cone shaped landers that have typically been used for planetary exploration in the past . newline_char even if it were possible for humans to go swimming in titan 's seas , it might not be advisable . newline_char truth can be stranger than fiction , indeed . story_separator_special_tag the aptly ( though unimaginatively ) named titan submarine phase i conceptual design could some day go for a dip in the hydrocarbon lakes of saturn ’ s moon titan . newline_char data from the voyager , cassini , and huygens ( deployed by cassini ) probes have confirmed that there are three large polar seas on titan ’ s surface , and the largest of them is known as kraken mare . newline_char titan has always been an interesting target for study because it ’ s so unusual for a moon . newline_char the nasa innovative advanced concepts program has developed a concept for a robotic submersible vehicle for planetary exploration , but it won ’ t be deployed in water . newline_char titan ’ s temperature can reach a positively frigid -179 degrees celsius ( -290 degrees fahrenheit ) . newline_char these super-low temperatures and thick atmosphere combine to create the feature scientists are so anxious to study in detail — vast lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane .
