 all goes well , the curiosity rover will be on the mars surface at about 1:17 a.m. eastern time , and 13 minutes , 48 seconds later ( the time it takes for a radio signal to travel 154 million miles to earth from mars ) , there will be confirmation and cheering in the control room at 1:31 a.m. newline_char but , a couple of minutes before landing , the landing site at gale crater will rotate out of view from earth – that means the direct communications path will be blocked , too . newline_char that is not powerful enough to be picked up by antenna on earth , but a nasa orbiter , mars odyssey , will act as a relay , re-transmitting the data to earth in real-time . newline_char using one of them , the so-called x-band , the curiosity will send simple messages directly to earth . newline_char or there could be silence – nothing from the rover , and probably a somber pall in mission control . story_separator_special_tag the landing , which could never be tested in full on earth , includes a hovering rocket stage newline_char “ our position will be identical to anyone at home , ” said adam steltzner , lead of the entry , descent and landing ( edl ) team . newline_char that tracking would come from the odyssey orbiter circling mars , if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time . newline_char if no signal arrives from curiosity via three mars orbiters and the deep space network after 18 hours , nasa officials said , then they would start to worry about its safety . newline_char if not , the waiting time for a final answer on whether the rover was safely on the surface could range from two to eight hours .
