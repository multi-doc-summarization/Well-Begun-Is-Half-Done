e campaign has been going on for weeks , and it 's become painfully clear that while the hashtag has elicited attention , the news coverage is n't enough to make a difference to the people at the center of  newline_char but i think hashtag activism should be used judiciously , especially when it comes to issues affecting the black community , at home and abroad . newline_char that 's why , after a few tweets , i ceased participating in the ongoing # bringbackourgirls campaign , which is designed to highlight the plight of more than 200 nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by boko haram last month . newline_char d.a . newline_char in some situations , it risks offering users of social media a false sense of accomplishment while obscuring underlying policy and structural issues as well as the full picture of what is taking place on the ground . story_separator_special_tag if 200 girls had gone missing in spain , whether white or black , there would have been far more coverage . newline_char # bringbackourgirls has exploded across social media , powered by a desire to reunite 200 kidnapped nigerian girls with their parents as well as a strong sense of outrage . newline_char facebook and twitter are well adapted mediums for protest , yet often the complaints made were not against boko haram , but against what was seen as the mainstream media ’ s wilful ignorance of the girls ’ kidnap . newline_char a volley of tweets argued that “ if these children were white european girls , countries would do something. newline_char the media weren ’ t ignoring those girls . newline_char news bulletins didn ’ t give the issue prominence newline_char ” they are right . newline_char not because of media racism but because such events in europe are unheard of and therefore in industry terms , more newsworthy .
