w , researchers report that they ’ ve used this sort of genome mining to reveal new insights about the daily life of our last universal common ancestor , or luca . newline_char the results suggest that luca was a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen , bolstering strong suspicions that life on earth formed in and around hydrothermal vents such as those found near undersea volcanoes . newline_char the  story_separator_special_tag the concept of a last universal common ancestor of all cells ( luca , or the progenote ) is central to the study of early evolution and life 's origin , yet information about how and where luca lived is lacking . newline_char we investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of luca . newline_char because these proteins are not universally distributed , they can shed light on luca 's physiology . newline_char among 286,514 protein clusters , we identified 355 protein families ( ∼0.1 % ) that trace to luca by phylogenetic criteria . newline_char luca 's biochemistry was replete with fes clusters and radical reaction mechanisms . newline_char their functions , properties and prosthetic groups depict luca as anaerobic , co 2 -fixing , h 2 -dependent with a wood–ljungdahl pathway , n 2 -fixing and thermophilic . newline_char the  story_separator_special_tag it is known as luca , the last universal common ancestor , and is estimated to have lived some four billion years ago , when earth was a mere 560 million years old . newline_char a surprisingly specific genetic portrait of the ancestor of all living things has been generated by scientists who say that the likeness sheds considerable light on the mystery of how life first emerged on earth . newline_char the
