revisiae genotypes from each of these regional sub-populations that span and represent the genetic diversity within each region . newline_char selection of s. newline_char cerevisiae genotypes recently knight and goddard17 isolated 3,900 s. story_separator_special_tag the previously overlooked vintner , a type of yeast called saccharomyces cerevisiae , makes a “ small but significant ” contribution to a wine ’ s flavour and taste , scientists reported in the journal scientific reports . newline_char “ i was surprised that we detected any signal at all from these geographically different yeast populations in the aroma profile of the wine — i thought we would not , ”  newline_char wine ( shuttershock ) being a winemaker is a specialised calling , requiring intimate knowledge of soil composition , seasons and weather , chemistry , flavour , even marketing and sales . newline_char this makes the fungus a key to that enigmatic wine concept “ terroir ” — everything from the soil , topography , climate and agricultural processes that go into producing your favourite bordeaux . story_separator_special_tag mat goddardthe distinct regional conditions , or terroir , in which grapes are grown are thought to shape a wine ’ s character . newline_char “ the wine community understands that yeast play a role [ in terroir ] —that the yeast on the plant could be giving a particular strain of merlot grown in two different locations two different flavors , ” he added , but newline_char “ the take-home message of this paper is that different strains of yeast used to ferment grapes impart a specific chemistry to the wine , ” said microbiologist jack gilbert of the argonne national laboratory in illinois who was not involved in the work . newline_char now , researchers in auckland , new zealand , have confirmed that at least one aspect of terroir—local differences in yeast strains—does indeed alter the outcome of sauvignon blanc fermentation .
