ch powerful quakes are relatively rare — scientists believe the last mega-quake to hit southern california was a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 1857 . newline_char scientists in recent decades have begun to realize that earthquake faults are interconnected . newline_char but as scientists identified more faults in california , " it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few well-separate faults , but with a vast interconnected fault system , " field said . newline_char the estimated chance of whether such a mega-earthquake would hit california in the next three decades was raised to 7 % from about 4.7 % , the u.s. geological survey said tuesday . newline_char the next magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake to hit california could come a little sooner than expected . newline_char why is the chance of a magnitude 8.0 quake greater than previously forecast ? newline_char an 8.0 earthquake hitting a populated area would be devastating — producing 89 times more energy than the magnitude 6.7 northridge earthquake in 1994 . newline_char "  newline_char multiple faults can rupture in a simultaneous mega-quake . newline_char here 's a look at how scientists figured out the new forecast . story_separator_special_tag ( associated press ) the chance of a magnitude-8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 percent from 4.7 percent , mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once , releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction . newline_char los angeles ( ap ) — scientists are virtually certain that california will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years . newline_char while the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates , it 's more likely — greater than 99 percent chance — that california will be rattled by a magnitude-6.7 jolt similar newline_char , after a magnitude-6.7 earthquake struck southern california ...
