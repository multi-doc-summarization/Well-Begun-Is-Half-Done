searchers from uc berkeley pieced together the brain patterns of its subjects as they watched youtube videos , and then produced a youtube video of their own with the results . newline_char during the first set , recorded brain activity was fed into a computer to program a " movie reconstruction algorithm , " which matched neural activity to what was taking place in the video . newline_char subjects then watched the same set of trailers as the algorithm pieced together a video based on brain activity recorded by the mri . newline_char " scientists have long been able to reconstruct static photos and images from reading brain patterns , but this is  newline_char the mri machine recorded the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex , the part of the brain that processes visual information . story_separator_special_tag the team then used the brain imaging data to develop a computer model that matched features of the videos -- like colors , shapes and movements -- with patterns of brain activity . newline_char the reconstructed videos are blurry because they layer all the youtube clips that matched the subject 's brain activity pattern . newline_char researchers from uc berkeley were able to reconstruct youtube videos from viewers ' brain activity -- a feat that might one day offer a glimpse into our dreams , memories and even fantasies . newline_char " once we had this model built , we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backwards through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw , " said gallant . newline_char subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain , measured by functional mri , predicted what was on the screen at the time -- whether it was steve martin as inspector clouseau or an airplane . newline_char " gallant 's coauthors acted as study subjects , watching youtube videos inside a magnetic resonance imaging machine for several hours at a time .
