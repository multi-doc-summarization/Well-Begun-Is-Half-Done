rlman , an inventor and patent holder who also happens to be a biophysicist at brandeis university , studied how wine hugs the edge of bottle spouts after being poured . newline_char an extremely bright gentleman by the name of daniel perlman set his sights on improving the wine bottle , and seems to have succeeded wildly by inventing a wine bottle that doesn ’ t drip when pouring . newline_char instead of hugging the bottle , the wine fails to bridge the gap and simply falls directly into its intended vessel until it stops coming out entirely . newline_char it typically results in wine running down the neck of the bottle and dripping onto whatever is beneath . newline_char perlman figured out that by adding one small groove around the lip of the bottle opening he could change the behavior of the liquid at the end of the pour . newline_char some household items have remained exactly the same for so long that you never really imagine that they could be improved upon , even if they have some pretty obvious flaws . story_separator_special_tag “ i wanted to change the wine bottle itself , ” perlman said . newline_char according to the school , the modern wine bottle design has been around since the 1800s , meaning it was ripe for innovation – and hopefully an end to 200 years of drips . newline_char for some reason , wine dripping down the side of the bottle when you pour it has become as accepted an inevitability as death and taxes ( both of which some people probably consider preferable to dripping wine ) . newline_char but a brandeis university physicist believes he has solved the problem – and all it took was a two millimeter tweak in the bottle itself . newline_char in looking to solve this issue , daniel perlman – a biophysicist at the massachusetts university – wondered if the bottle might be the cause .
