e results chime with previous studies linking schizophrenia and cannabis , but suggest the association may be due to common genes and might not be a causal relationship where cannabis use leads to increased schizophrenia risk . newline_char cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world , and its use is higher among people with schizophrenia than in the general population . newline_char " we know that cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia . newline_char our study certainly does not rule this out , but it suggests that there is likely to be an association in the other direction as well – that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use , " said robert power , who led the study at the institute of psychiatry at king 's college london . story_separator_special_tag the resulting studies suggest that the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia might also put people affected by the disorder at increased risk for smoking pot . newline_char today , these findings are more nuanced , but researchers still think that cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in people who are predisposed to the disease — meaning those with family histories of the disorder . newline_char this , researchers say , demonstrates that the causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia might not be clear-cut , and that at least a small part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap , where the same genes that predispose certain people to enjoying weed might also predispose others to developing schizophrenia newline_char part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap now , a new study , published today in molecular psychiatry , lends further support to the idea that schizophrenia plays a role in an individual 's likelihood of smoking weed , by showing that the genetic variants predicting schizophrenia can also be used to predict a person 's tendency to smoke pot , regardless of their mental health history .
