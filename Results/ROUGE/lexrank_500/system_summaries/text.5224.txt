y points key points : taller people have more cells in their body , as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow for every 10cm over the average height , a person 's risk for cancer increases 10 per cent new analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this , and also finds a few specific cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height leonard nunney , an evolutionary biologist at the university of california , riverside , looked at massive cancer databases to find out how the number of cells in a person  story_separator_special_tag a number of studies have previously found a link between a lofty stature and a greater risk of developing some form of cancer , with research suggesting that for every 10cm of height within the typical range for humans , the risk increases by about 10 % . newline_char report suggests link between height and cancer risk could simply be because there are more cells for something to go wrong in taller people have a greater risk of cancer because they are bigger and so have more cells in their bodies in which dangerous mutations can occur , new research has suggested . newline_char scientists have put forward a number of different explanations for this , including that certain growth hormones could play a role in both height and cancer , or that environmental factors such as childhood nutrition or illness could be a factor . story_separator_special_tag the findings match with previous research , which has also connected height to an increased risk of developing a range of health problems including blood clots , heart problems and diabetes . newline_char a person 's risk of developing cancer increases by 10 % for every 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) they are over the average height , the study said , because they have more cells which could mutate and lead to cancer . newline_char ( cnn ) tall people are at a greater risk of cancer because they have more cells in their body , new research has suggested .
