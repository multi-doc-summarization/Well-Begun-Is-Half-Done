if you put in a box a worm , a mollusk , an arthropod and a fish , and you shake , then what you have at the end is a tully monster , " said carmen soriano , a paleontologist at argonne national laboratory . newline_char since 1955 , when amateur fossil hunter francis tully discovered the unlikely prehistoric creature in a coal mining area near morris , the thing that would be named the tully monster has presented one of the great puzzles in paleontology . newline_char the tully 's renown stretched even to the illinois state legislature , which named it the official state fossil in 1989 , some 308 million years after it inhabited the shallow salty waters that turned into the state 's mazon creek geological deposits , in grundy county , one of the richest fossil troves on earth . story_separator_special_tag since it was first uncovered more than a half a century ago , this kooky-looking creature known as the “ tully monster ” has puzzled paleontologists who , frankly , could not make heads , tails or claws of its fossilized remains . newline_char to come to their conclusion , team members first pored over 1,200 tully monster specimens from museums . newline_char the creature was named after francis tully , the amateur who discovered it in 1958 in the mazon creek in illinois . newline_char now , a team of researchers from yale university say they have figured out the monster ’ s identity : it ’ s a vertebrate most closely related to the lamprey , an underwater bloodsucker . newline_char they closely examined the creature ’ s features , like its torpedo-shaped body and triangular tail , the proboscis that looks like an elephant ’ s trunk with sharp teeth , and the eyes on the side of its head , which resemble a hammerhead , but are similar to eye stalks found in crabs and insects .
