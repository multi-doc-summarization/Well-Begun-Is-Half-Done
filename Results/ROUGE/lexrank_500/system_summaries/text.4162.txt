sla wants its vehicles to signal automatically without the driver needing to go through the agony that is lifting their finger and moving it up or down by several inches . newline_char the way that tesla envisions it working is that the car detects the driver 's intent to change lanes or make a turn by using the autopilot hardware at its disposal , it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them , it puts the signal on for the driver . newline_char if it works , it will be brilliant but given the fact that tesla has remained adamant that it does n't need driver monitoring systems for autopilot , it seems questionable that the vehicle would be able to detect a driver 's intent to turn based solely on external observation . story_separator_special_tag tesla has filed for a new patent that describes a technology to automate turn signals . newline_char the company describes the system in the patent application : “ an embodiment includes a method of automated turn signaling , the method comprising : determining , via the processor , that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn based on a measured steering angle value that is within a value range stored in a memory , wherein the car includes the processor , the memory , and the turn signal source ; and activating , via the processor , the turn signal source based on the determination that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn. newline_char ” here ’ s a flowchart that explains when the system would activate the turn signal for the driver : newline_char by leveraging its autopilot technology , the automaker thinks it can detect when a driver should activate its turn signal and do it for them if they forget it .
