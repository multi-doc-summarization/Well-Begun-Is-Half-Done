age copyright i khalil , s misra image caption sperm-inspired robots " swim " when they are made to wiggle by a moving magnetic field engineers have built a sperm-like robot that they can control with magnets . newline_char other studies of this process have included coupling a magnetic tail to a red blood cell , or controlling real sperm by steering them in metal microtubes . newline_char the simple design has a metal-coated head and a flexible body about six times longer than a human sperm . newline_char " we have built a biologically inspired micro-robot that looks like a sperm cell but is completely fabricated in the lab , " said dr sarthak misra , a robotics engineer at the university of twente in the netherlands . newline_char precise navigation  newline_char sperm , like some bacteria , use a whip-like " flagellum " to propel themselves through fluid . story_separator_special_tag misra and a team of scientists at his university and the german university in cairo design robots inspired by nature or ones that use living microorganisms , such as magnetically propelled bacteria and sperm cells , for performing complex tasks on small scales . newline_char the tiny robots mimic the shape and movement of sperm cells and can be steered using magnetic fields . newline_char just when you thought you 'd seen every kind of robot there is , researchers develop bots inspired by sperm . newline_char when the sperm bots were exposed to an oscillating magnetic field with a strength newline_char in a new study , published today ( june 2 ) in the journal applied physics letters , the researchers created 322 1-micron-long ( about 10 times the width of a human hair ) robots with heads thickly coated with cobalt-nickel , but uncoated tails . newline_char dubbed " magnetosperm , " the robots could be useful for administering medicine or carrying out in vitro fertilization , researchers say .
