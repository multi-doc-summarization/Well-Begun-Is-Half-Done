e procedure - based on a new in vitro fertilisation technique that incorporates dna from three parents - was necessary because the baby 's mother carries mitochondrial dna mutations for leigh syndrome , a fatal neurological disorder . newline_char the treatment , which seeks to avoid mothers passing defective mitochondrial dna to their offspring , was performed in mexico . newline_char the world 's first " three parent baby " was born five months ago to jordanian parents . newline_char the  story_separator_special_tag in humans , most genes are found in dna in the cell 's , called nuclear dna . newline_char however , some genes are found in dna in specialized structures in the cell called . newline_char while most people with leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear dna , about 20 percent have a mutation in mtdna . newline_char this type of dna is known as mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) . newline_char most genes associated with leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria . newline_char leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of more than 75 different genes . newline_char five protein complexes  newline_char the  story_separator_special_tag a five-month-old boy is the first baby to be born using a new technique that incorporates dna from three people , new scientist can reveal . newline_char the  newline_char ‚Äù the controversial technique , which allows parents with rare genetic mutations to have healthy babies , has only been legally approved in the uk . newline_char but the birth of the child , whose jordanian parents were treated by a us-based team in mexico , should fast-forward progress around the world , say embryologists . story_separator_special_tag except she 's not , because every cell in alana 's body is n't like mine and yours - alana is one of a few people in the world who have dna from three people . newline_char " i also have dna from a third lady . newline_char the
