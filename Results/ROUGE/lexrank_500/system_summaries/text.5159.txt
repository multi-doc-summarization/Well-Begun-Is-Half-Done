u really can tell how intelligent a man is just by looking at him , scientists say ( and the key is a long face and bigger distance between the eyes ) team baffled by results - and found they do not work on women say prediction was not based on face shape - but a combination of facial features researchers have found we have an inbuilt ability to tell how intelligent a man is just by looking at them . story_separator_special_tag people can predict the iq of men — but not women — by looking at their face , study finds new research published in plos one has found that a man ’ s facial characteristics contain some clues about his intelligence . newline_char at the same time , we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess intelligence from static facial photos : the ratings of both sexes were highly correlated , ” karel kleisner of charles university in prague and her colleagues wrote in their study . newline_char “ our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher than chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women . story_separator_special_tag no relationship between perceived intelligence and iq was found for women . newline_char methodology/principal findings we used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured iq , perceived intelligence , and facial shape . newline_char both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs . newline_char we used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence , as well as with intelligence as measured by iq testing . newline_char in addition to general intelligence , figural and fluid intelligence showed a significant relationship with perceived intelligence , but again , only in men .
