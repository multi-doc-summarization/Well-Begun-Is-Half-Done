study from the us national institutes of health presents some of the most precise human data yet on whether cutting carbs or fat has the most benefits for losing body fat . newline_char his model simulations showed that only the carb-restricted diet would lead to changes in the amount of fat burned by the body , whereas the reduced-fat diet would lead to greater overall body fat loss , but he needed the human data to back it up . newline_char in a paper published august 13 in cell metabolism , the researchers show how , contrary to popular claims , restricting dietary fat can lead to greater body fat loss than carb restriction , even though a low-carb diet reduces insulin and increases fat burning . newline_char he noticed that despite claims about carbohydrate versus fat restriction for weight loss , nobody had ever measured what would happen if carbs were selectively cut from the diet while fat remained at a baseline or vice versa . story_separator_special_tag nih study finds cutting dietary fat reduces body fat more than cutting carbs in a recent study , restricting dietary fat led to body fat loss at a rate 68 percent higher than cutting the same number of carbohydrate calories when adults with obesity ate strictly controlled diets . newline_char “ compared to the reduced-fat diet , the reduced-carb diet was particularly effective at lowering insulin secretion and increasing fat burning , resulting in significant body fat loss , ” said kevin hall , ph.d. newline_char these findings counter the theory that body fat loss necessarily requires decreasing insulin , thereby increasing the release of stored fat from fat tissue and increasing the amount of fat burned by the body. newline_char “ but interestingly , study participants lost even more body fat during the fat-restricted diet , as it resulted in a greater imbalance between the fat eaten and fat burned .
