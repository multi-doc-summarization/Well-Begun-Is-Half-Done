r decades , physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes . newline_char it also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer . newline_char " this is the kind of paper we love , " says david jackson , a physicist at dickinson college in carlisle , pennsylvania , and editor of the american journal of physics , a publication of the american association of physics teachers . newline_char the new calculation , which appears in the march issue of the journal , does n't merely add more detail about the structure of earth , he notes . newline_char " that 's what makes  story_separator_special_tag abstract this paper examines the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of earth as ascertained from seismic data . newline_char numerically , it is found that the time taken to fall along the diameter is 38 min , compared to 42 min for a planet with uniform density . story_separator_special_tag credit : nasa ( phys.org ) â€”alexander klotz a student at mcgill university in canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question , how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the earth ? newline_char that is a physics question put to students every year , and those who give it expect the answer to be 42 minutes . newline_char the accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into newline_char he has published his reasoning , math and conclusions in a paper published in the american journal of physics . newline_char but is that answer correct ? newline_char instead of the commonly accepted 42 minutes , he claims it is 38 . newline_char if someone were to drill a hole all the way through the planet , and then somehow manage to fall into it , how long would it take them to arrive on the other side ?
