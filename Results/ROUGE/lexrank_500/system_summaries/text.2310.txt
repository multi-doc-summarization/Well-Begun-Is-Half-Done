ntalupo image caption an intense quasar can , like a flashlight , illuminate part of the surrounding cosmic web the hidden tendrils of dark matter that underlie the visible universe may have been traced out for the first time . newline_char astronomers obtained the first direct images of a part of this network , by exploiting the fact that a luminous object called a quasar can act as a natural " cosmic flashlight " . newline_char cosmology theory predicts that galaxies are embedded in a cosmic web of " stuff " , most of which is dark matter . story_separator_special_tag 300 shares share tweet google reddit linkedin mail sign up to receive our weekly newsletter of the most popular space stories : astronomers from the university of california â€“ santa cruz have found a far-off quasar lighting up a very large nebula of spread out gas , showing for the first time part of the network of filaments believed to link galaxies in a cosmic web . story_separator_special_tag the inset is a zoomed-in , high-resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web , 10 million light-years across , from a simulation that includes gas as well as dark matter ( credit : s. newline_char computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a " cosmic web " of filaments , as seen in the image above from a large-scale dark-matter simulation ( bolshoi simulation , by anatoly klypin and joel primack ) . newline_char the intense radiation from a quasar can , like a flashlight , illuminate part of the surrounding cosmic web ( highlighted in the image ) and make a filament of gas glow , as was observed in the case of quasar um287 . story_separator_special_tag astronomers have for the first time captured a glimpse of the vast , web-like network of diffuse gas that links all of the galaxies in the cosmos .
