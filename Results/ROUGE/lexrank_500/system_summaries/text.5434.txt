r atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 vsmow , which would mean that early mars ( 4.5 billion years ago ) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep . newline_char abstract we measured maps of atmospheric water ( h 2 o ) and its deuterated form ( hdo ) across the martian globe , showing strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high d/h enrichment indicative of great water loss . newline_char the maps sample the evolution of sublimation from the north polar cap , revealing that the released water has a representative d/h value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to earth ’ s ocean ( vsmow ) . story_separator_special_tag the huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet ’ s surface , as great a portion as the atlantic covers the earth , and was a mile deep in places . newline_char in total , the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water , or more than is found in the arctic ocean , the researchers found . newline_char a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold , nasa scientists say . story_separator_special_tag view images originally earth and mars had identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water . newline_char the hydrogen in water , whether it 's on mars or on earth , comes in two varieties : ordinary hydrogen , whose nuclei contain newline_char photograph by nasa astronomers using some of the world 's most powerful telescopes have determined that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the martian surface four billion years ago .
