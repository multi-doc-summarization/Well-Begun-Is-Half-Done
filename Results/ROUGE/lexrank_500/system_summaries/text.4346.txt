 american doctoral student named oliver ( armie hammer ) arrives for the annual internship elio ’ s father offers . newline_char 17-year-old elio ( timothee chalamet ) is once again visiting his family ’ s summer home with his parents : his father ( michael stuhlbarg ) , an esteemed professor of greco-roman culture , and his mother ( amira casar ) , a translator and gracious hostess . newline_char chalamet and hammer have just ridiculous chemistry from the get-go , even though ( or perhaps because ) their characters are initially prickly toward each other : testing , pushing , feeling each other out , yet constantly worrying about what the other person thinks . newline_char oliver is everything elio isn ’ t—or at least , that ’ s our primary perception of him . newline_char from the wild , windswept hills of “ i am love ” to the chic swimming pool of “ a bigger splash , ” guadagnino vividly portrays the outside world as almost a character in itself—driving the storyline , urging the other characters to be bold , inviting us to feel as if we , too , are a part of this intoxicating atmosphere . newline_char elio has the gangly body of a boy but with an intellect and a quick wit beyond his years , and the worldliness his parents have fostered within him at least allows him to affect the façade of sophistication . newline_char by the end of the summer , that kid will be vanquished forever . newline_char but really , what ’ s the rush ? newline_char never has this been more true than in “ call me by your name , ” a lush and vibrant masterpiece about first love set amid the warm , sunny skies , gentle breezes and charming , tree-lined roads of northern italy .
