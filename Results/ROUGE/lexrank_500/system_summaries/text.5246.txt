evious studies have already suggested a possible association between sleep and risk of stroke , but today 's study , published in the journal neurology , is the first to provide detailed information about the british population and to examine the relationship between a change in sleep duration over time and subsequent stroke risk . newline_char people who sleep for more than eight hours a day have an increased risk of stroke , according to a study by the university of cambridge - and this risk doubles for older people who persistently sleep longer than average . newline_char researchers from the department of public health and primary care at the university of cambridge followed just under 10,000 people aged 42-81 years of age from the european prospective investigation into cancer ( epic ) -norfolk cohort over 9.5 years . story_separator_special_tag results : after 9.5 years of follow-up , 346 cases of stroke occurred . newline_char participants reported sleep duration in 1998–2000 and 2002–2004 , and all stroke cases were recorded until march 31 , 2009 . newline_char long sleep was significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke ( hazard ratio [ hr ] = 1.46 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.08 , 1.98 ] ) after adjustment for all covariates . newline_char the association for short sleep was smaller ( and not statistically significant ) ( hr = 1.18 [ 95 % ci 0.91 ,  story_separator_special_tag there ’ s no way to diagnose a stroke before it happens , but researchers say they ’ ve identified a clue to help doctors predict who ’ s at risk – the amount of sleep they get at night . newline_char even worse , the stroke risk for people who went from sleeping less than six hours to sleeping more than eight hours was nearly four times greater than for people who consistently got six to eight hours of zzzzs . newline_char the findings may help clarify the fuzzy relationship between sleep and stroke .
