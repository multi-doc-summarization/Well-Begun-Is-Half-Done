cording to the patent filing , airbus ’ scientists say it could provide a “ simple , economic and efficient solution ” to one of the main shortcomings of the traditional cylindrical passenger cabin : the need for relatively heavy “ sealed bottoms ” at the front and back of the tube to cope with the effects of pressurization . newline_char now its scientists have dreamed up something much more outlandish : a revolutionary , futuristic aircraft design where passengers sit in a circular cabin enclosed in a sort of delta-wing structure . newline_char ” if airbus were to try to develop the model commercially , it would have to overcome some formidable technical and regulatory obstacles . newline_char the fact that passengers are supposed to board from below via a hatch , for example , doesn ’ t sit comfortably with regulations on emergency exits . newline_char viewed from the side , the design looks like a raindrop on its side ( or like some of the jet-propelled cars designed to break the world land speed record , if you prefer ) . newline_char it ’ s only a couple of months since the toulouse , france-based company filed a patent application for a new ultra-economy class concept that looked like a row of bicycle saddles . story_separator_special_tag the design also offers space for more passengers , who will sit in a 360 degree cabin , rather like an amphitheater . newline_char in the u.s. patent application , citing the investors as patrick lieven , romain delahaye and catalin perju , airbus said that the usual " cylindrical geometry " of aircraft increased pressure at the front and back of planes and limited passenger-carrying capacity . newline_char the france-based company filed a patent application at the end of october for a new type of aircraft , structured to limit the strain of cabin pressurization .
