t transplants run the risk of rejection , so more than a decade ago , researchers proposed a way around that : create tissue from stem cells that bear the patient 's own dna , obtained with a process called therapeutic cloning . newline_char stem cells can turn into any cell of the body , so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease . newline_char this undated image made available by the oregon health & science university in may 2013 shows a stem cell colony developed from cloned human embryos . newline_char ( associated press ) scientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos , a longstanding goal that could lead to new treatments for such illnesses as parkinson 's disease and diabetes . newline_char if dna from a patient is put into a human egg , which is then grown into an early embryo , the stem cells from that embryo would provide a virtual genetic match . newline_char that idea was met with some ethical objections because harvesting the stem cells involved destroying human embryos . newline_char scientists have finally recovered stem cells from ... story_separator_special_tag most groups gave up long ago on the finicky core method — production of patient-specific embryonic stem cells ( escs ) from cloning . newline_char mitalipov and his team have finally created patient-specific escs through cloning , and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing . newline_char ohsu photos it was hailed some 15 years ago as the great hope for a biomedical revolution : the use of cloning techniques to create perfectly matched tissues that would someday cure ailments ranging from diabetes to parkinson ’ s disease . newline_char therapeutic cloning , or somatic-cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) , begins with the same process used to create dolly , the famous cloned sheep , in 1996 .
