u 'd never need this level of precision for getting to work on time , but the clock could be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems , said study co-author andrew ludlow , researcher at the national institute of standards and technology in boulder , colorado . newline_char " in order to understand what 's so special about this table-sized clock , it helps to have a little background : how clocks work inside a clock is a  newline_char the rate of ticking of this timepiece -- known informally ( and awkwardly ) as the ytterbium optical lattice clock -- does not change by more than one part in 10^18 , ludlow said . newline_char " the ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking , new level of clock stability , " he said . newline_char go , clock , go ! newline_char researchers have released a study in the journal science describing what they believe is the world 's most precise clock . newline_char in other words , if there is any variation in how a second is measured , it would be in about the 18th decimal place . story_separator_special_tag 22 issue of science express that the ytterbium clocks ' tick is more stable than any other atomic clock . newline_char nist 's ultra-stable ytterbium lattice atomic clock . newline_char the ytterbium clock ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion ( 1 followed by 18 zeros ) , roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks . newline_char a pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has set a new record for stability . newline_char laser light is transported to the clock by five fibers ( such as the yellow fiber in the lower center of the photo ) .
