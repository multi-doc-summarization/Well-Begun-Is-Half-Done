rm atlantic waters wage a new assault on arctic ice from below a new enemy is undermining ice floating on the arctic ocean : heat from below . newline_char sensors that have plumbed the depths of arctic seas since 2002 have found warm currents creeping up from the atlantic ocean and helping drive the dramatic retreat of sea ice there over the last decade . newline_char the paper shows “ a massive shift ” in the behavior of the arctic ocean over a short time , says finlo cottier , a physical oceanographer with the scottish association for marine science in oban who was not part of the study team . newline_char a new study shows this “ atlantification ” of the arctic ocean as a new , powerful driver of melting , alongside losses due to rising air temperatures . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag when healthy , the arctic ocean exhibits a surprisingly resolute system of stratification — thick layers of ice that provide a natural barrier to nutrient mixing , one of the hallmarks of an ocean like the atlantic . newline_char climate change is melting the sea ice so rapidly that parts of the arctic ocean are beginning to take on characteristics of the atlantic ocean . newline_char the change could affect everything from how freshwater is stored and delivered to how the ocean itself responds to increasing acidity , according to a study published in the journal science on thursday . newline_char the atlantic ’ s mixing process , by which it draws heat upward from the deeper ocean and circulates nutrients , means that the base of its food web is more prolific , resulting in more alkaline water . story_separator_special_tag new research sheds light on the latest example of the changes afoot , showing that parts of the arctic ocean are becoming more like the atlantic .
