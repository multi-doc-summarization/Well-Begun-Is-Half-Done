study , led by academics at the universities of nottingham and bristol and published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences ( pnas ) , reveals the link between breeding season and the hormone melatonin , made in the pineal gland in the brain during long winter nights . newline_char click here for full story “ the length of the day is recognised in most vertebrate animals by the pineal gland in the brain , which produces melatonin . newline_char joint senior author david bates , professor of oncology in the school of medicine at the university of nottingham , said : “ changes during the year in sex hormones made in the pituitary gland control when mammals start reproducing , and other changes like growing new coats or developing antlers . story_separator_special_tag study may reveal why melatonin affects breeding , horn growth and coat thickness – and allow farmers to change the timing of lambing season why do sheep get horny in winter ? newline_char scientists say they have uncovered the key to the mechanism by which changes in the length of the day prompt certain animals to begin breeding , trigger the growth of horns and even change the thickness of their coat . story_separator_special_tag in birds and mammals , this process of adaptation is mediated by the release of hormones from the pituitary gland that control multiple functions such as reproduction , the response to stress , and when the animals grow a new coat . newline_char a new study , conducted at the university of bristol , has identified how animals measure annual time to control seasonal fertility . newline_char the measurement of day length , however , and consequently time of year , is mediated by the hormone melatonin , which is released from the pineal gland during the night .
