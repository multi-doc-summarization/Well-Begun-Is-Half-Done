re than 50 such genes , including components of fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) signalling , tgf-Î² and bone morphogenic protein ( bmp ) signalling , and wnt signalling pathways , as well as many transcription factor genes , were inferred to be lost based on the coelacanth data ( supplementary data 7 and supplementary fig . newline_char to understand this aspect of the water-to-land transition , we surveyed the latimeria genome annotations to identify genes that were present in the last common ancestor of all bony fish ( including the coelacanth ) but that are missing from tetrapod genomes . newline_char previous studies of genes that were lost in this transition could only compare teleost fish to tetrapods , meaning that differences in gene content could have been due to loss in the tetrapod or in the lobe-finned fish lineages . newline_char as the species with a sequenced genome closest to our most recent aquatic ancestor , the coelacanth provides a unique opportunity to identify genomic changes that were associated with the successful adaptation of vertebrates to the land environment . story_separator_special_tag the coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods , meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants , from reptiles and birds to mammals . newline_char the decoding of the coelacanth genome , reported online wednesday in the journal nature , is a victory for the lungfish as the closer relative to the first tetrapod . newline_char the coelacanth has fleshy , lobed fins that look somewhat like limbs , as does the lungfish , an air-breathing freshwater fish . newline_char often called a living fossil , the coelacanth ( pronounced see-luh-canth ) was long believed to have fallen extinct 70 million years ago , until a specimen was recognized in a fish market in south africa in 1938 .
