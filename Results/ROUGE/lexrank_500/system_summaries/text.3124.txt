is water exists because geothermal heat flow from below , coupled with pressure , movement , and the insulating nature of the ice sheet above , is great enough to maintain some areas at the base of the ice sheet above the freezing point , even in the extreme cold of antarctica . newline_char the whillans ice stream subglacial access research drilling project ( wissard ) is using  newline_char subglacial aquatic environments over the last several decades , by using ground penetrating radar and other remote sensing tools , scientists have discovered that under the massive antarctic ice sheets there lies a vast hydrological system of liquid water . newline_char wissard in order to explore one of these hydrological systems at the margin of the west antarctic ice sheet , we have organized an interdisciplinary project to access the subglacial environment . newline_char in topographic depressions there are hundreds of lakes , both large and small ; some are isolated , but many are interconnected by water channels and large areas of saturated sediments , the water eventually running out into the southern ocean as the ice sheet becomes a floating ice shelf . story_separator_special_tag tomorrow 's edition of the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of microorganisms living far beneath antarctic ice . newline_char special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet , where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years . newline_char a team led by montana state university professor john priscu brought up samples from below the ice that contained single-celled microbes called archaea , which convert ammonium and methane into energy to survive and grow . newline_char similar expeditions have found sub-ice environments teeming with bacteria in recent years , but questions have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process . story_separator_special_tag
