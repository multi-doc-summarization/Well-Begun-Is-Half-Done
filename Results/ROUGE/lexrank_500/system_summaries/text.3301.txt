er the past several weeks , you may have come across one of those wacky predictions that a planet called " nibiru " or " planet x " is lurking " behind the sun " or somewhere else out of view in our solar system but threatening an imminent existential catastrophe nonetheless . newline_char eso/tom ruen/nagualdesign scientists are searching for an unseen planet hiding somewhere in our solar system , but not one set to seemingly appear from nowhere to collide or nearly collide with earth , ushering in an age of apocalypse . story_separator_special_tag one of its most dedicated trackers , in fact , says it is now harder to imagine our solar system without a planet nine than with one . newline_char if a planet is there , it 's extremely distant and will stay that way ( with no chance -- in case you 're wondering -- of ever colliding with earth , or bringing " days of darkness " ) .it is a possible " planet nine " -- a world perhaps 10 times the mass of earth and 20 times farther from the sun than neptune . story_separator_special_tag while the mysterious world still has yet to be found , astronomers have discovered a number of strange features of our solar system that are best explained by the presence of a ninth planet , according to the nasa statement . newline_char the hypothetical planet is believed to be about 10 times more massive than earth and located in the dark , outer reaches of the solar system , approximately 20 times farther from the sun than neptune is . newline_char a possible " planet nine " in earth 's solar system would orbit far beyond neptune 's orbit ( visible as a bright ring around the sun in this artist 's illustration ) .
