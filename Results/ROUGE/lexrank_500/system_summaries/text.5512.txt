the study , published in the journal nature geoscience , estimated a total volume of underground water to be almost 23 million cubic kilometres , of which 0.35 million cubic kilometres is younger than 50 years old . newline_char using data and computer models , an international team of researchers estimated that less than six percent and perhaps as little as one percent of water found close to the earth 's surface is renewable in a human lifetime . newline_char underground water is found beneath the earth 's surface and is recharged by rain , snow or water that leaks from the bottom of lakes and rivers . newline_char it can be found as deep as 30,000 feet ( around 9 km ) , according to the united states geological survey ( usgs )  newline_char its age can be a few months to millions of years . story_separator_special_tag the bigger part of the study is the " modern " groundwater story . newline_char " with the growing global demand for water -- especially in light of climate change -- this study provides important information to water managers and policy developers as well as scientists from fields such newline_char the report shows that less than six per cent of groundwater in the upper two kilometres of the earth 's landmass is renewable within a human lifetime . newline_char for the first time since a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the global volume of groundwater was attempted in the 1970s , an international group of hydrologists has produced the first data-driven estimate of the earth 's total supply of groundwater . newline_char it ranges in age from months to millions of years old . newline_char we 're using our groundwater resources too fast -- faster than they 're being renewed . newline_char groundwater : it 's one of the planet 's most exploited , most precious natural resources .
