e difference is that i used the new amazonbasics microwave , which works with alexa . newline_char the way the alexa integration works is pretty clever : when you set it up , it will get paired to your alexa system as “ the microwave , ” and then you can command alexa to , you know , cook stuff . newline_char there are very few buttons on the microwave because all the presets for various food types have been stored in amazon ’ s cloud instead . newline_char it is , indeed , a microwave there is an alexa button on the microwave , and it does two things : it turns on the microphone on one of your echo speakers so you don ’ t have  newline_char that “ works with alexa ” phrasing and the fact that this isn ’ t the “ echo microwave ” should tell you that this thing doesn ’ t have any microphones or a speaker ( beyond one that can beep ) on it . story_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag of course , this is n't the first microwave with alexa voice control features , other companies like ge , whirlpool , kenmore , lg and samsung have either made or are working on appliances with amazon 's cooking skill . newline_char at its event , senior vice president of amazon devices dave limp said " alexa , one potato " to the microwave , and it set a timer and turned on . newline_char the new microwave will come with " dozens of quick-cook voice presets , " much like traditional microwaves already offer , except you wo n't have to lift a finger . newline_char but this is the first amazon-branded microwave , meaning it 's hardware from the company itself and offers better integration with alexa . newline_char he also told alexa to stop the microwave . newline_char he then said " alexa , add 30 seconds to the microwave , " and the assistant updated the countdown .
