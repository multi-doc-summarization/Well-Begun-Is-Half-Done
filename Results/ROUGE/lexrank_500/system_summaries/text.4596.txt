r results showed significant positive associations of brain volume and iq ( r=.24 , r ( 2 ) =.06 ) that generalize over age ( children vs. newline_char positive associations between human intelligence and brain size have been suspected for more than 150 years . newline_char nowadays , modern non-invasive measures of in vivo brain volume ( magnetic resonance imaging ) make it possible to reliably assess associations with iq . story_separator_special_tag for centuries , scientists have been investigating the link between human brain size and intelligence , with several studies suggesting inconclusively that the bigger the brain , the smarter a person . newline_char but a review of 88 studies involving more than 8,000 participants has now shown that even though a small link between brain volume and iq exists , there 's no evidence to suggest it 's a causal one . newline_char instead , it 's the structure of your brain that seems play a larger role in determining how smart you are . story_separator_special_tag in a meta-analysis of data from more than 8000 participants , they show that associations between in-vivo brain volume and iq are small . newline_char an international team of researchers from the universities of vienna ( austria ) , g√∂ttingen ( germany ) , and tilburg ( netherlands ) provides no evidence for a causal role of brain size for iq test performance . newline_char the brain structure is more important than the size is brain size related to cognitive ability of humans ? newline_char with the advent of brain imaging methods ( e.g. newline_char , mri , pet ) , reliable assessments of in-vivo brain volume newline_char as early as 1836 , the german physiologist and anatomist friedrich tiedemann , in an article in the philosophical transactions , expressed his opinion that " there is undoubtedly a connection between the absolute size of the brain and the intellectual powers and functions of the mind " .
