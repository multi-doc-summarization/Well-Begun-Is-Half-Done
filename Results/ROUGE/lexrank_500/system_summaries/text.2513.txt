age caption researchers were surprised to see liquid water coming up through the drill hole as temperatures were below freezing researchers say they have discovered a large reservoir of melt water that sits under the greenland ice sheet all year round . newline_char the melting of the greenland ice sheet has been a significant contributor to a rise in sea levels over the past 100 years . newline_char the water is stored in the air space between the ice particles , like the juice in a snow cone prof rick forster , university of utah according to the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the ice sheet lost 34 billion tonnes of ice per year between 1992 and 2001 - but this increased to 215 billion tonnes between 2002 and 2011 scientists still have many unanswered questions about the direction and speed and ultimate destination of this melted water . newline_char ice free liquid this new research finds that a significant amount is stored in partially compacted snow called firn . story_separator_special_tag in southeast greenland , more than 100 billion tons of liquid water soaks a slushy snow layer buried anywhere from 15 to 160 feet ( 5 to 50 meters ) below the surface . newline_char despite decades of poking and prodding by scientists , only now has the massive ice island revealed a hidden aquifer . newline_char until now , researchers thought most of this water went to the ocean or refroze on the ice . newline_char a drill rig was used to extract old snow ( firn ) cores from within the greenland snow aquifer . newline_char tracking this surface runoff helps scientists account for ice lost to melting each year . newline_char the discovery will help scientists better understand the fate of greenland 's annual surface melt , which contributes to sea level rise .
