long time ago , mary anne huntsman and kris humphries ( kim kardashian 's soon-to-be-ex and former utah jazz player ) saw elf together and he ate a big tub of popcorn . newline_char there was no second date , this is not really newsworthy , and yet it somehow blows our minds . story_separator_special_tag mary anne , abby , and liddy huntsman are the twentysomething daughters of presidential candidate jon huntsman jr. newline_char would-be first daughters ( from left ) : liddy , mary anne , and abby huntsman . newline_char as a stylist feathered mary anne 's hair with a curling iron , liddy cued up " hold on " by wilson phillips on her iphone . newline_char despite all the free media attention his daughters have garnered on his behalf , as of this writing huntsman remains a margin-of-error candidate . newline_char so she and her sisters shot a funny or die–style parody of the ad that doubled as a huntsman spot . newline_char the huntsman daughters ' three-headed social-media presence is a mischievous , seemingly unfiltered corrective to the stage-managed sneering of the campaign . newline_char , which means that the sisters—who 've become celebrities over the past few months for tweeting snarky updates from the campaign trail at @ jon2012girls—are sort of unofficially running for first daughters . newline_char which makes this technically a campaign stop , even though there are no voters here and we 're in a banquet room that smells like old rice . newline_char lately they 've been playing this song to get psyched up before watching their dad debate . newline_char it went viral , and newline_char they wore fake mustaches ; instead of smoking , they blew bubbles . newline_char at the end , he takes a defiant , denis leary–ish puff on a cigarette . newline_char even in the context of a republican race already shaping up as the battle of who can come off like a bigger assclown before losing the nomination to mitt romney , this was weird .
