cording to a review from hispanically speaking news , the mcdonald 's failure in bolivia lies in the very marketing strategy that made it so popular elsewhere : the documentary includes interviews with cooks , sociologists , nutritionists and educators who all seem to agree , bolivians are not against hamburgers per sé , just against ‘ fast food , ’ a concept widely unaccepted in the bolivian community . newline_char for 14 years , mcdonald 's attempted to court bolivians into making a habit out of eating their processed menu items -- only to experience an overwhelming , nation-wide rejection . newline_char perhaps if we all valued our meals as much as bolivians , mcdonald 's corporate health would suffer newline_char a group of filmakers have attempted to answer that question in the documentary why did mcdonald ’ s bolivia go bankrupt ? newline_char but what makes bolivia different from nearly every other country in its apparent distaste for mcdonald 's fare ? newline_char so , in light of the loss of revenue , mcdonald 's corporation made an unprecedented announcement : that it would close its restaurants in bolivia -- making it the only country in the americas without a mcdonald 's . newline_char and as a result , for the first time ever , the cogs of mcdonald 's international burger-slinging machine have ground to a halt , forcing the company to close its doors in bolivia in 2002 . newline_char there may be something a bit snarky about celebrating a corporate failure , even if it hardly dents the fast-food giant 's bottom line , but it 's difficult not to judge bolivia better off for having rejected a restaurant so often associated with a menu of dubious nutritional value and less-than eco-friendly business practices . newline_char one might be hard-pressed to find consumers even outside of bolivia who would n't agree with that definition of ' a good meal ' , yet none have expressed it so profoundly by simply choosing not to eat at mcdonalds .
