elie penguins , slick and efficient swimmers , live on the antarctic continent and on many small , surrounding coastal islands almost six million adelie penguins are living in east antarctica , more than double the number previously thought , scientists said wednesday in findings that have implications for conservation . newline_char before , population estimates only took into account breeding pairs , said australian antarctic division seabird ecologist louise emmerson . newline_char " these birds are an important reservoir of future breeders and estimating their numbers ensures we better understand the entire population 's foraging needs . newline_char " however , our study in east antarctica has shown that non-breeding adelie penguins may be as , or more , abundant than the breeders . newline_char on this basis , they estimate a likely global population of 14 to 16 million . newline_char " adelie penguins , slick and efficient swimmers , live on the antarctic continent and on many  story_separator_special_tag previous estimates had the east antarctic population at closer to 2.3 million . newline_char extrapolating from that , their best guess is 14 to 16 million birds in the whole of antarctica . newline_char antarctic scientists wildly underestimated the number of ad√©lie penguins in just one part of antarctica by , oh , a paltry 3.6 million or so . newline_char well , scientists now believe there are 5.9 million penguins on a 5,000 km stretch of coastline in east antarctica alone . newline_char so how did a team of french , japanese and australian scientists suddenly find an extra 3.6 million flipper flappers ? newline_char you squawkin ' to me ? newline_char but how many of them are there ? newline_char the key is how you recover from them . newline_char hey , we all make mistakes . newline_char australian antarctic division seabird ecologist dr louise emmerson had the answer to that on wednesday .
