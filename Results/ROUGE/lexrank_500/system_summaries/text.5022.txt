tory_separator_special_tag  story_separator_special_tag the arrival 36 years ago of a strange bird to a remote island in the galapagos archipelago has provided direct genetic evidence of a novel way in which new species arise . newline_char in this week 's issue of the journal science , researchers from princeton university and uppsala university in sweden report that the newcomer belonging to one species mated with a member of another species resident on the island , giving rise to a new species that today consists of roughly 30 individuals . newline_char the study comes from work conducted on darwin 's finches , which live on the galapagos islands in the pacific ocean . story_separator_special_tag there are at least 15 species of darwin 's finches , so named because their diversity helped famed naturalist charles darwin figure out his theory of evolution by natural selection - that is , mutations can help species become better adapted to their environment , and be passed down  newline_char now , genomic sequencing and the analysis of physical characteristics have confirmed the new species of darwin 's finch , endemic to a small island called daphne major in the gal√°pagos . newline_char for the first time , scientists have been able to observe something amazing : the evolution of a completely new species , in the wild , in real-time . story_separator_special_tag the group of finch species to which the big bird population belongs are collectively known as darwin 's newline_char image caption this is an image of the big bird lineage , which arose through the breeding of two distinct parent species : g. newline_char conirostris a population of finches on the galapagos has been discovered in the process of becoming a new species . newline_char researchers followed the entire population of finches on a tiny galapagos island called daphne major , for many years , and so they were able to watch the speciation in progress .
