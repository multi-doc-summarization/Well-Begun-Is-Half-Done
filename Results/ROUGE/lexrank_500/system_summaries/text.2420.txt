 2012 mochizuki posted a 500-page paper online that claimed to solve the puzzle , but it required a dense framework of new maths dubbed " inter-universal teichm√ºller theory " that even experienced mathematicians found difficult to follow . newline_char now mochizuki has posted a new report describing his efforts to explain his theory to others . newline_char shinichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan , has tried to prove the abc conjecture , a long-standing pure maths problem , but now says fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work . newline_char mochizuki is a highly-respected mathematician and his work is taken seriously , says minhyong kim of the university of oxford , but in the years since he posted the proof no one has been able to give a definitive answer on whether it is correct . newline_char " it 's a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it 's right or wrong , " he says . newline_char he has also criticised the rest of the  newline_char he says that three researchers who studied it with his help have yet to find an error , but it will take a few more years for it to be fully confirmed . story_separator_special_tag shinichi mochizuki of kyoto university , japan claims he has proven the abc conjecture , one of the longest standing mysteries of mathematics . newline_char in fact , the theory poses some significant questions about the actual nature of numbers , so truly understanding it would be highly significant for mathematics . newline_char the beauty of this theory is that it captures the intuitive sense that triples of numbers which satisfy a linear relation , and which are divisible by high perfect powers , are rare . newline_char in number theory , a smooth number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers . newline_char step in , mochizuki . newline_char mochizuki says his fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work .
